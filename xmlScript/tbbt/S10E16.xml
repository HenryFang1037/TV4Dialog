<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Go. Come on, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s no way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is an Euler’s Disk. It’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, look at you watching sports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But Raj is from India, which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kind of busy right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, an Euler’s Disk, fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Immature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How ya doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s not gonna make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, see, what’s happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ha, you’re interested. You’re out ten bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s slowing down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Dig deep, like when we bet you couldn’t fit into Howard’s pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s not gonna make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, Raj, it’s like your favourite movie, you’re just Waiting to Exhale. Yeah, I knew you could do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is Princess Bride.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli (on skype)</speaker><content>Hello, Rajesh. How are things by you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good, good. Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Well, you’re a grown man with a steady job. Why wouldn’t you spend all your father’s money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, Daddy, you’re so rich and funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>I’m sorry to hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know you are. That’s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>It’s too much work. You’re an adult who can’t get by without an allowance from his parents. Women don’t want that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you saying, that you’re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient. I don’t think I’m the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t believe what I’m hearing. This is deeply hurtful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>You’re also too sensitive. Women don’t want that either.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The food here’s supposed to be great. Don’t fill up on chips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I won’t. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didn’t see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, look. It’s Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If the judge couldn’t explain it to me, I don’t see how you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Oh, hey, guys. What brings you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, we’re having date night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Nice. I’m meeting someone, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, really. Anybody we know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I doubt it. I met her on G-Harmony. That’s a Web site for geologists to find love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s a real thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Yeah. Their slogan is we’re all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, have a lovely evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Thanks. You, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you think that’s more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you’re crazy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, we could’ve come to you guys. You didn’t have to bring the baby here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, it’s okay. It’s good to get out of the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And the car ride puts her to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who forgot to crack the window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, someone’s been shopping at Gucci.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn’t resist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s so sweet of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a crushed velvet baby cape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, no, now we have two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That must’ve been expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, it was. But it’s my father’s money and I’m mad at him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on with your dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It turns out he doesn’t care if I’m married or if I’m single. He’s basically given up on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sure that’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But all you did was complain when he did that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, Leonard, he’s hurting. Let him feel how he feels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Shoes, I’m a seven-and-a-half, boots, I’m an eight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sorry, I don’t have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I’m gonna head out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, no. Are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it’s time to cut bait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bert, I insist that you join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>You really wouldn’t mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not at all. Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Thanks. I’ll go grab a chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want me to look at him and listen to him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My father thinks the reason I can’t make a relationship work is because I’m spoiled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that I’m spoiled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, how much exactly does he pay for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll tell you, but please don’t judge me. He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m trying, but I’m judging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe your dad’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe your dad’s right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Good question. Let’s see. Infoseek, WebCrawler, oh, HotBot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, literally any other topic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>All right. How did you guys meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, we met online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Well, I really envy your relationship. Other than you two only having sex once a year, you’re the perfect couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You-you know about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Were you aware of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why aren’t you talking to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because I’m mad at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, now I’m sorry I asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s why they’re doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? If you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t need your dad’s money. You can get by on your salary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, we work at the same place as you, and we’ve always been fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Let’s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is it really that high?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to say because I don’t know how much it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You don’t how much your rent is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, then double it, because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you know how much your car costs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, how much do you spend on food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The housekeeper does the shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m going to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you’re clearly more sofa-sized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This isn’t fair. You’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s different. She’s a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That lady has a name. I don’t know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>When you moved here, you didn’t have a lot of money. How’d you get by?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What, what are you doing? I, I, I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why don’t you like me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I thought we were best friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We are, that’s why I’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Raj. We really just don’t have the space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What if he lives in your garage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What if you stop helping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Guys, I’m not living in a garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s a great idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, but if I’m gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, only if you’re sure. Whew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy?  Amy?  Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I’ll take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Don’t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as I’m saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I do appreciate you working on this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s that little dot in the middle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s reserved for thoughts I don’t share with anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Interesting. You really have secrets you don’t tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I hear one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, they’re private.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why? Are they naughty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Two years ago I got my driver’s license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What? Why didn’t you say anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn’t have to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you didn’t. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli (on skype)</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello, Father. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I’m a man, and I can take care of myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>That’s wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>I am so proud of you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Dr Koothrapalli</speaker><content>Sorry. Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money. Where did I fail as a father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much, so don’t cut me out of the will.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you brought your own lunch. Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m making a bunch of changes. This morning, I fired my dog walker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. How’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, I gave her an Imodium. That’s tomorrow’s problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. We’re scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people’s lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>He’s right. And I’m sorry for the part I played in this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, Bert. You’re a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>That doesn’t paint me in the best light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. – That better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people’s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What brought that on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s understandable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.</content></utterance>
