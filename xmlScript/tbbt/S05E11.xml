<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to hear something weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. I thought it was a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Basketball Pope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And that’s how it’s done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, that was a different guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, that was a different, different guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, what do you think he wants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I told you. That was a different guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t have clams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s Howard doing tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Worst part was, it was too big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. You poor thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God, that’s awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did Kathy Geiger laugh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? I was not a bully.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Shh. That’s how you wind up in a cornfield.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is that him over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, I can really do this by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You wore underwear? You fool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s quite a list. I can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Scrotum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s that one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, stapled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Jimmy (arriving)</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Holy crap, man, it’s good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you’re a big-time scientist now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m doing okay, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Okay? Come on, I read online you’re a physicist at a university, you won some medal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The Newcomb medal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Yeah, congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like the Black Death and Europe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s the idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>This is just between us, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching, Annie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How exactly would these glasses work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>How the hell should I know? That’s why I need a nerd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think something like that’s even possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You’re like the smartest guy I’ve ever known.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-53"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-54"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-55"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-56"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>What’s this word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You really need to work on your penmanship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-60"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Oh, man, I, I don’t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-61"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It wasn’t fun for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-62"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-63"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-64"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That was pretty badass, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-65"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-66"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re doing great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they’d melt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word’s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I actually knew that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I never doubted you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There’s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house, I’m going to build one for someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How about donating some of your clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What about helping people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And helping people.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s your cocoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Heated to precisely 183 degrees?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You got one for good luck.  I’ll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls’ locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What’s this word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Laxative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>You’re a beautiful guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Okay, I got to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you okay to drive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>I wouldn’t be imposing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, we can’t let him drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>Not really, no. It’s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we’re reversed. You’re the winner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Jimmy</speaker><content>You mind if I use your bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, just back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what would be nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Donated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable.</content></utterance>
</scene>
