<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That was absolutely humiliating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, but you don’t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein’s Bar-Mitzvah party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was giving clear, concise orders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Oh, hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Morning ma’am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how was paintball, did you have fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, um, oh hey, I’m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A boy-girl party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it’ll just be a bunch of my friends, we’ll have some beer, do a little dancing…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dancing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The thing is, we’re not….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re really more….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you sure? Come on, it’s Halloween.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A Halloween party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>As in, costumes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is there a theme?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, yeah, Halloween.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>As usual, I’m not following.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about comic-books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Anime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>TV , film, D_D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard (off)</speaker><content>I’ll get it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume)</speaker><content>Bjow </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh no! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We all have other costumes, we can change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Agreed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I call Frodo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Damn!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj (Entering dressed as Thor)</speaker><content>Hey. Sorry I’m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You went with Thor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he’s not English, but he’s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously the Doppler Effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not Peter Pan, I’m Robin Hood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the Doppler Effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s not…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny (opening door, not in costume)</speaker><content>Oh, hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, sorry we’re late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Late? It’s 7:05.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you said the party starts at seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s 7:05.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What, are all the girls in the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Probably, but in their own homes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So what time does the costume parade start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The parade?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, I’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This party is just going to suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, come on, it’s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that’s so cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, Penny, he’s Rob…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No you don’t. Oh, hey, what’s Sheldon supposed to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See, people get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mmmm, by Odin’s beard, this is good Chex Mix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No thanks, peanuts, I can’t afford to swell up in these tights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re socialising. Meeting new people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Telepathically?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen)</speaker><content>Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What is your move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where do you get this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there’s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Nurse Costume Girl</speaker><content>No thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I  want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I don’t know how to talk to these people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I actually might be able to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then what happens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s as far as I’ve gotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you’re coming with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-54"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I hardly think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-55"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-56"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. But I need a wing-man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>Girl in Hippie Costume</speaker><content>Oh, Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-60"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-61"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-62"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>So, what are you supposed to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-63"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-64"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Uh, a choo-choo train?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-65"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-66"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>A brain damaged choo-choo train?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-67"><speaker>Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj)</speaker><content>How wasted am I? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-68"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Neeeeeooooowwwwww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-69"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I still don’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-70"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m the Doppler Effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-71"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it’s very insensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-72"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-73"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-74"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I’m Frodo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-75"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, well, I’m the Doppler Effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-76"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-77"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-78"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-79"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-80"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-81"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-82"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-83"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have a back-up hypothesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-84"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe they just want to be friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-85"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-86"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then he and I are on equal ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-87"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-88"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-89"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-90"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-91"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-92"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-93"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-94"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-95"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-96"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-97"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>What, you’re a zebra, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-98"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yet another child left behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-99"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-100"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m a Hobbit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-101"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>What’s the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-102"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-103"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-104"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-105"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Well, whatever, why don’t you go hop off on a quest, I’m talking to Penny here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-106"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think we’re all talking to Penny here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-107"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not. No offence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-108"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Okay, maybe you didn’t hear me, go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-109"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright Kurt, be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-110"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-111"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Kurt!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-112"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-113"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Are you calling me a puffy animal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-114"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course not, no, he’s not, you’re not, right Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-115"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-116"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If he understands that, you’re in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-117"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>So what, I’m unevolved?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-118"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-119"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-120"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Kurt, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-121"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-122"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Okay, now you’re starting to make me mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-123"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-124"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-125"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think I’ve made my point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-126"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-127"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-128"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-129"><speaker>Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground)</speaker><content>C – O – N… frontation!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-130"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Kurt, put him down this instant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-131"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>He started it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-132"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t care, I’m finishing it, put him down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-133"><speaker>Kurt</speaker><content>Fine. You’re one lucky little leprechaun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-134"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m so sorry about what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So why was he at your party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I ran into him last week and, he was…  just, all apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I’m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and… I can’t go back to my party because he’s there, and I know you don’t want to hear this and I’m upset and I’m really drunk and I just want to… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How much have you had to drink tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just…. a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It might. Boy, you’re really smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, you are so great. Why can’t all guys be like you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I should probably go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Probably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Penny (in doorway)</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
