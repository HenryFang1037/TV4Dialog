<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let’s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun, but when you’re listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Apparently, if you’re Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can’t get on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. What are you guys doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. How’d he do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That bad, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Read this woman’s tweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how’d the lecture go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In a word, triumphant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Triumphant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, please let me tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, I kind of promised Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tell me what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. I think I’ll turn in. I didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>FYI, I think that’s what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon still moping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mmm, I know the feeling. It’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you guys doing okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, that shouldn’t be too hard. He’s such a cutie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Labradoodle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We might be starting to zero in on your problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t you listen to them. You’ve got plenty of sex appeal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. You’re a hottie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy (on webcam, with an undersea background)</speaker><content>So, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not even when I do this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For instance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I’m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re an  actress, correct?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not an actress. I’m an actress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. You’re an actress. I need you to teach me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want an acting lesson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps two. I’d like to master the craft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, where is this coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, when could we start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose that’s one way to look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think it’s the only way to look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you going to help me or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Probably. I’m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll pay you 40 dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj, I have amazing news!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, that’s incredible!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. The only thing is, I’m gonna be gone for two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Aw, I’m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I have to stay here for school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s what we’re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What kind of needs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sexual needs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, while I’m gone, you’re going to have to satisfy her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I say okey-dokey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard (to the real Raj who is daydreaming)</speaker><content>What ya thinking so hard about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just that I’m definitely not gay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing. I was acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You were acting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. In preparation for today’s studies, I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler’s</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, good for you. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How shall we begin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon (doing nothing)</speaker><content>You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you’re doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re the teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don’t we try some improvisation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is all about listening and responding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gotcha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it’s not a movie. It’s improv. So no one calls action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d like a frozen yogurt, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yogurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? Let’s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and we’re going to use props?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have any frozen yogurt?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard (phone rings)</speaker><content>Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did you hear? Isn’t it terrible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Have you seen him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They wouldn’t let me in. Oh my Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.  It’s Howard. Howard, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj, is that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m right here, buddy. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Shh, shh. Listen to me. I’m not gonna make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, no, don’t say that. You’re going to be all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj, I don’t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sexually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sexually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s how I heard it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leonard (out of Raj’s daydream)</speaker><content>Or it could be sy-fee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, right. Good one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I didn’t care for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you think it’s better than Tennessee Williams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>KMN.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon’s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would we want to do that? It’s called the comfort zone for a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. You’ll be Spock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s only logical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. I’ll set the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hoo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now just read your mother’s line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I’ll never understand that boy. But then again, I’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I just don’t buy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just keep going!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, okay, let’s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
