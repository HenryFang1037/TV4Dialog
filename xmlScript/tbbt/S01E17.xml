<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it’s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, I’m really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Once you’re fluent you’ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard (entering)</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mai du lui tsa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My apologies Leonard, I’m only as good as my teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you learning Chinese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If I were you, I’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny (storming in)</speaker><content>I need to use your window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny (opening window)</speaker><content>Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll tell you what’s going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog.  Drop dead, you stupid self-centred bastard!  Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not now, I have a blog to find.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny (voice off)</speaker><content>I’m fine, Leonard, just go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>GO AWAY!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, feel better, bye.  She doesn’t want to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not surprising. Penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, look, I found an iPod.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was Penny’s boyfriend’s, they broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, I’m going to go back and try talking to her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not going to do that, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about “damsel in distress?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You’d also have to be knighted for that to apply.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t care. She’s upset, I’m going over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they’re warm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m her friend, I’m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What, so you’re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you’ll just walk away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I said I’m her friend. Not her gay friend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard (knocking and entering)</speaker><content>Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn’t want to talk…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard (leaving)</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, did you say wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s got to be one or the other, which is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what were the choices again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, no, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually it’s not all that easy to find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought…. never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, you know, this isn’t that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sandwich shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Doesn’t that violate the health code?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, at the sub shop we were only making out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, do you think I overreacted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. You’re right. I should just say I’m done with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you should, go ahead, say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But I never gave the man a chance to explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m pretty sure I never said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw, good for me. Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m going over to Mike’s. Leonard, thank you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, I’m going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn’t make my point with those people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>For God’s sake, Sheldon, if you don’t like the tangerine chicken, don’t order the tangerine chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I like tangerine chicken, I’m not getting tangerine chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we please change the subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just roll the dice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj (rolls and moves)</speaker><content>Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6…7</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just eat your tangerine chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d love to, but I don’t have tangerine chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny (storming in)</speaker><content>Thank you so much for your stupid advice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard (knocking and entering)</speaker><content>I’m back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry I yelled at you. It’s not your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I went over to Mike’s to make up with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, I know that part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But he had already moved on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Already, that was quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How could he do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod… yeah, no, how could he do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that must get old quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What about you what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about if you went out with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you asking me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um… yes… I am… asking you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was just going off your comment about the nice guy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard (continuing through Penny)</speaker><content>…thing and honest but, it’s no big deal…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, I will go out with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s the spirit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny (tapping him on the shoulder)</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon (jumping in panic)</speaker><content>Aieee ya! Xia si wo le.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Look, do you have a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A second what? Pair of underwear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It’s about Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, Raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I suppose he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All I’m saying is, you know Leonard the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not necessarily. I’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.   And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re not done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ach, why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so, here’s the thing. I guess you’re aware that Leonard asked me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just… want to sit down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, choose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There are a number of options and, I’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, why don’t you just pick one at random, and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, that’s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Um, here’s the thing. So, I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, yeah, I don’t really know who they are…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t care, I don’t care. The point is Leonard isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. What I’m saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But on the other hand, if things don’t go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he’s not looking for a fling, he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don’t know, like you would say light years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you for the clarification.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a common mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not the first one I’ve made today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. I think this will be my seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I’m talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, let’s see. We might consider Schrodinger’s Cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. That’s Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn’t have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-46"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I don’t get the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well of course you don’t get it, I haven’t made it yet. You’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-48"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what’s the point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just like Schrodinger’s Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-50"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so you’re saying I should go out with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard (pointing)</speaker><content>Two seats right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon (to two oriental-looking people occupying the other seats)</speaker><content>Chong sho sha pwe.  Xie xie. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I think I’ve made a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can see that. Unless you’re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s about Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you’ll have to narrow it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think I can go out with her tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Other people would say “why not?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Other people might be interested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to talk anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I assumed you would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now that I’m actually about to go out with Penny, I’m not excited, I’m nauseous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Schrodinger’s Cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, that’s brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I made an eight o’clock reservation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger’s Cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Actually, I’ve heard far too much about Schrodinger’s Cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good. </content></utterance>
