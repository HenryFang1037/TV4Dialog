<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here’s the problem with teleportation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lay it on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, he would be exactly the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, you see it too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Dr Gablehouser (arriving)</speaker><content>Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Dr Gablehouser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Gentlemen, I’d like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we’re hoping to have him do his graduate work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Graduate work, very impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>And he’s only fifteen years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Advantage Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we’re the best physics research facility in the country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>I already know you’re not. You don’t have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Well, obviously you don’t see it yet, but trust me, you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Dennis, we discussed this, we’re in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we’ve agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can count on us, we’re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition… ooh, look, chocolate milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sense a disturbance in the force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard (in a Yoda voice)</speaker><content>A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>A year and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No kidding, you speak English really well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>That.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Is this part of the tour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nope. Goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Looks like you’re doing work in quantum loop corrections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Keen observation, goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>You see where you went wrong, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh, yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve got nautilus equipment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Do I look like I lift weights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not heavy ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>It’s startling to me you haven’t considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You think I haven’t considered it? You really think I haven’t considered it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Have you considered it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get him out Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the radiation lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Wow, you won the Stephenson award.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Really, how old?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fourteen and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>You were the youngest person ever to win it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny (to Raj)</speaker><content>Mmm, this is really delicious, isn’t it?  Still can’t talk to me unless you’re drunk, huh?  Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I’m damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure. Raj, hug Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon (dramatically)</speaker><content>Uh-uh-uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he’s already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to… you know, that other guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Antonio Salieri?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, God, now even you’re smarter than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, Sheldon, you don’t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just eat, Sheldon, you’ll feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can’t let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, you’ve got a bit of competition, I really don’t see what the big deal is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We liked Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve decided you’re right. My career is not over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So I’ve decided, I’m going to collaborate with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I’ve never really paid attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don’t need any help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what’s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It would blow up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Pretty sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re concerned about sharing credit with me, you’re name can go first… I’m going.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard (into phone)</speaker><content>It’s a small brown paper bag, Ma, I’m looking at it right now.  Why would I make that up, there’s no ding-dong in it.  How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>So, this is engineering, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard (into phone)</speaker><content>I’ll talk to you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just came by to say hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve been at this lab for three years, you’ve never came by to say hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, up until now I’ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really, how does it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, huh. So it’s a shelf?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you don’t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it’s a shelf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, I notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did Leonard tell you to say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I thought of it all by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh. It can’t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I’m missing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Go away. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Curiouser and curiouser.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard (entering)</speaker><content>Is he here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If he were, I wouldn’t be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is that even possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>As it turns out, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Something’s got to be done about him, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then our problem would be solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I’m not saying no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We don’t have to go that far, there are other means available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We can’t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What about biology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, he’s fifteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She was sleeping with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>Oh, good, you’re all here. Look, I’ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you’re working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops.  Go away?  Hmm. Could it be me?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny (opening door)</speaker><content>Oh, hey guys, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s possible she may have misunderstood us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Gablehouser (entering)</speaker><content>Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you’ll appreciate this, very exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Oh, what are you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I’m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>To what end?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, it’s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Who will come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The Jewish people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>What if they don’t come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’ll make it nice, put out a spread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we’re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who’s agreed to join us here at the University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can’t you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Okay, well, uh, obviously you’re very busy with your… uh, um, come Dennis. You’ll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he’s been under a lot of… um… he’s nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon (voice off, sings to a Mexican tune)</speaker><content>Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They’ll come, they’ll settle and I’ll win the prize…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I really don’t understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn’t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Goldfarb</speaker><content>Go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Goldfarb</speaker><content>Please go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Said Pharoah to Moses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Why are all these young women here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s take your daughter to work day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Really, I was not aware of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Hm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>There’s the man of the hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We need a social catalyst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like what? We can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Or can we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, we can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t think you mean we can’t. I think you mean we shouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it’s definitely me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. How about that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you crying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I have allergies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, uh, how about her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, so not her either. How about her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t talk to her, you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we’re not in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Alright, why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, that was uncalled for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You started it, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Could I have everyone’s attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We’re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-42"><speaker>Sheldon (sarcastically)</speaker><content>Welcome Dennis Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-43"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-45"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-46"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-47"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-48"><speaker>Dennis</speaker><content>Um, no thanks. I’m going to the mall with Emma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-49"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Well, uh, well, uh….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The kid got a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-51"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-52"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did anyone see how he did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-53"><speaker>Sheldon (to Gablehouser)</speaker><content>Don’t worry, I’ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-54"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-55"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, mission accomplished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-56"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-57"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-58"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-59"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-60"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, let’s go with that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, look at that.  It’s Dennis Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, I almost didn’t recognise him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, we really ruined his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Screw him, he was weak.</content></utterance>
