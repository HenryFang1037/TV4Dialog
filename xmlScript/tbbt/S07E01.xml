<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon (in the apartment)</speaker><content>Hello to you, too. I’m sorry, but this is important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What was what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To be honest, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Good night.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is that true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You would do that for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette (on phone)</speaker><content>Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy (on phone)</speaker><content>Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You overestimate his significance in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great. I’ll go first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>By the way, how are you with zippers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>It is. You can download my paper off the university server.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How’d it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It was better when you couldn’t talk to women.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>To the advancement of science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And to the sick and dying who make it possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>From the two gentlemen at the bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Be cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re right. Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh. Bad move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My queen can now take your rook from below.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So that means I lose, right? It’s over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having too much fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let’s take a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re all out of alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m calling him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing)</speaker><content>Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Everybody</speaker><content>Hi, Penny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Best time of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Random voice</speaker><content>Iceberg!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-oh, hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you in danger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Everybody</speaker><content>Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You were.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So what happened? How’d it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And why would no one blame me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know what I’m saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s really sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, now I miss him even more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, seriously?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Forget about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Is that right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How about we just talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. In 4D chess…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I own nine pairs of pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How about I go first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s your big revelation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is to me; that’s the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your apology is accepted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you. How about a hug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How about a hearty handshake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, that felt nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Both</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Are you hitting on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Looks like she accepted your apology.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, please, you did not have a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Who died and made you king of moments?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, not a thing.</content></utterance>
