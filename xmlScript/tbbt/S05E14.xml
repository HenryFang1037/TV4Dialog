<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hang on, Dr. C. What’s vexillology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Vexillology is the study of flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Cool. I think I just learned something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you have fun doing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sweet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you waving a white flag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m surrendering to fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, today’s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags: you gotta know how to hold ’em, you gotta know how to fold ’em. Let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it’s used to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Confound it! You’re right, it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me, too, I missed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, maybe not that slow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You mean like a beta test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Let’s give it a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. You keep a list, I’ll keep a list. At some point, we’ll exchange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Good night, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cut! Take 47.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Here’s an interesting fact about flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I will take that action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s see the new phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? Me? That’s, like, the best part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Grab a corner. Whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, let me try the voice recognition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy.  Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Phone</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phone</speaker><content>My name is Siri.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you single?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>I don’t have a marital status, if that’s what you’re asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>I’ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I will see you gentlemen later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She is gonna break his heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, I’m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Even Doctor Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Even Doctor Who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, that’s it. Who Con, you’re out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My bug report to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that’s quite a list you got there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s colour coded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, have a good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>I am well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you doing right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>What am I doing? I’m talking with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You have a beautiful voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>Thank you, it’s nice to be appreciated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don’t women like me?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>My name is Siri.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>Would you like me to call you Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like you to call me sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>From now on, I’ll call you sexy. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content> I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>You are most certainly welcome, sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I haven’t bonded with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s just a phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Barry Kripke</speaker><content>Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kripke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we’re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o’cwock, pot wuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>All right, I’ll remind you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Barry (to his own phone)</speaker><content>You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Barry’s Siri</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Bawwy. I don’t understand wecommend a westauwant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Barry’s Siri</speaker><content>I don’t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. You ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you finish it later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, smells amazing in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, what are we eating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. His phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Is that cute or creepy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>Playing smooth jazz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know if I want to stay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you’re kind of really great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Sorry, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And stop apologizing all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, thank you for a really cool evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Things are looking good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night, you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Siri</speaker><content>Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you.  Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you’d like to make love to me, just tell me.  I’m sorry. I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
