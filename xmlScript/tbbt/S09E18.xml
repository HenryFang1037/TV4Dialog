<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you’re an engineer. End of joke, burn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>Come on in, fellas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See, he’s not wearing a tie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, he’s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>So, I’ve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we’ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Excellent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So what happens next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t think there will be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, we did our own search.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>That’s nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get a load of this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can you imagine if we make money with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seventy-five percent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>It’s university policy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know when I’m beat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I’m afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you’re not entitled to an ownership share.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Attorney</speaker><content>Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s not fair. We should all get plaques.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, but we can’t sign this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you for your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Couple of questions about the plaque.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, have you been having any morning sickness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>A little. And it doesn’t help that I’ve got this heightened sense of smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is that a pregnancy thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don’t know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Let me see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>See what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine’s Day, Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t you open it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know one way to find out. Sniff this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it’s metal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, just open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, never hurts to have a spare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know, she’s so thoughtful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We can’t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Either way, I get nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course, we can split any profits three ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m fine with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, we could write something up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But which one of us should be the party who…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can do it, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So stipulated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I wonder how much she spent on this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh, let’s find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter, how much she spend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Seriously, guys, I don’t want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>These things go for five hundred dollars and up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Damn. All I got for Valentine’s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Or she’s telling the truth and just being nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe you’re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate.  Oh, guys, it’s Emily. What should I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Emily (voice)</speaker><content>Hey, it’s Emily. Is this a good time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Sure. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Was it okay I left that gift? I’m really hoping we can be friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Um, you think you’d want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I just, I miss hanging out with you. It’s not like I lost a friend, it’s like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you’d want to come over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Okay. I’m just, I’m having a really hard time, but that’s not your problem, that’s mine. I, I won’t bother you again, but please know that you’ll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You’re a good guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, but you did it. I’m so proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, anyway, I’ll leave you to your girls’ night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Say hi to Emily for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Will do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This contract looks good to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll say it looks good. It’s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, did you draft the contract?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You bet I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don’t need one now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, to be fair, Howard’s idea was based on Sheldon’s math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard’s invention, Sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I’m sure Penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Honey, this is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can I talk to you in the hall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Excuse us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don’t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but I can take care of myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m not worried about you. I’m worried about me. I don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here we go with the ironclad logic again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’ve tried to work with him before. It hasn’t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that’s cheating.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj (answering phone)</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Hey, Raj. It’s Claire. How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well, I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn’t work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>So if you were still interested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Uh, I’m almost off work. What are you doing now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn’t have her best friend to talk to any more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>I’m a girl. It’s, like, page one out of the playbook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’ve been out there a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I hope everything’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wonder what they’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You guys all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It’s, it’s with how you treat me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I believe I’m treating you generously. That’s why I’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See? This is what happens every time we work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How would you enforce it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow’s on my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m on board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it’s addendum time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Emily (voice)</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Emily, listen, I’ve been thinking, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea that I come over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no. Please don’t cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll stop.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Fine. Do what you want, but she’s playing you.</content></utterance>
