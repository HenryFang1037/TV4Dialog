<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So there are some rules.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I got some old underwear I’m gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, why old?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>‘Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D_D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Isn’t every conversation you two have awkward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ready whenever you guys are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says,  Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  Oh, Lucy’s free after all. See ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. We just started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead, I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says,  don’t worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest.  Well, I’m just a tree, but if I were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Go on, give him your lunch money.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you’ll know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Oh, it’s okay. I’ve been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What else have you been thinking about doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Well, let’s see. I’d love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don’t like bangs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I like your bangs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, I like ’em, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Mmm, it’s kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns _ Ammo.53</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, it does. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He does sound effects, too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon.  Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guess who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s an excellent question. Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Long story short, she’s on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin anybody else’s weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, that’s my girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D_D? Do you have a drug problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons _ Dragons with girls before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  You’re playing D_D. You’re playing D_D. This whole apartment is playing D_D.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, who wants a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don’t consume alcohol during Dungeons _ Dragons. It impairs our judgment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes me like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Double potion, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I draw my broadsword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I ready my quarter-staff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I drink my potion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I say we attack the big one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The dungeon master’s supposed to roll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, fifteen or higher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>More potion, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How are your crab cakes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Kind of funky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>It is? Does funky mean something different in India?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no. Uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Mmm, it’s okay. I just won’t eat ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Everything all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>‘Kay, thanks, bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>N-No, it, it’s fine. Uh, He’s from a different country, he doesn’t understand our ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t be silly. Just tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>I have to go to the bathroom. And it’s not because the crab cakes are funky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>So you’re okay here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Uh-oh.  Hey, Raj. Funny story.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, Amy, there’s one ogre left. Take him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Lucy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Hey. Long time no see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why would you leave like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>You were pushing me. I clearly didn’t want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Well, how can I tell you I’m upset if I can’t tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead’s my best feature? It’s scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>How could you like me a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>I’m sweating out of my head.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine.  You’d think, after all these years, I’d know not to fly over volcanoes. I’m a freaking idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, Amy, it’s your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Here we go. Fifteen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Wait. And says?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, they’re talking about sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, then I’m out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh! Come on, back me up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. What do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You see what happens when you let girls play D_D?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content> Amy.  Amy.  Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. It’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And now what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you have any interest now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have not ruled it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow. Talk dirty to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess I know that. It’s just, part of me wants more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>More? I mean, look at us. It’s only been three years, here we are in bed together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on. Let’s go back out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I kiss you on the lips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I kiss you back on the  lips as well. Your turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I remove your armour. What do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I erotically caress your  nose.</content></utterance>
