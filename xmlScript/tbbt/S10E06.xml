<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I got asked to sign autographs there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You just said yourself, it’s sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it’s not a West Coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don’t stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry I mentioned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, don’t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That’s called teamwork.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s a kick. That’s an actual kick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I felt a kick. There’s a baby in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, that’s where I put it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I mean, I know you’re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Which MIT did you go to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are we even in a good school…? Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I warned you, and I did it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, there’s so much I want to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s an odd mix of people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You never went into that haunted house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, where you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait till you see the crib we found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You bought a crib without me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re gonna love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sounds expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But it’s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don’t like it, we can return it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In our new minivan. Hey, what’s for lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You bought a minivan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s for the baby, and I didn’t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then again, he did think you were my husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, why not five and ten bucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, that guy’s looking over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Hi. I love your movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>It has got to be one of the worst things I’ve ever seen in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your love confuses me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would you like an autograph?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Who do I make it out to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Daniel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That did not clear things up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’ll be four seventy-five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Daniel</speaker><content>Keep the change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How old was it</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>It’s hard to say. I don’t remember much after I drank it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Mrs Petrescu</speaker><content>Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s learning English from TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Mrs Petrescu</speaker><content>TV, good. Now back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>These are for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, they’re pretty. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Mrs Petrescu</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So, what did I miss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Mrs Petrescu</speaker><content>15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Anybody else coming to this thing?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>Jeff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>My favourite part is your shower scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Been hearing that a lot today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Jeff</speaker><content>I even have a screen grab on my phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yep, there they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s keep it moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Should’ve punched that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, go ahead. He’s right over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>Hi. I like your movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>I saw both of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>You think I could get a picture of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no. It’s not okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m her husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>No, you’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, he really is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s got a rearview camera, there’s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It’s like we’re living in the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, is it your back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Things didn’t work out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I’m warning you, hide your good rocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Mrs Petrescu</speaker><content>My sister’s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Really, no one else is coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is it. You are the practice round.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Practice round? For-for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So, I’m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>But how did you get her to go out with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, she moved in across the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And he started to slowly wear me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like a river carves a canyon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Red-haired guy</speaker><content>Ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>Hang on. This guy’s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Red-haired guy</speaker><content>This guy? But he’s wearing a change maker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think it’s hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s right. I’m her change daddy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They’re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re right. It sells itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I was hoping it’d be quieter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why is it taking so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favourite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>This is the best blintz I’ve ever had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Bert</speaker><content>It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, Stuart, don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I’m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m always the last one anybody thinks of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no, that’s not true. I mean, sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Awkward guy</speaker><content>Oh. Whoa. I didn’t know you can propose to the same person so many times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, once, I proposed to him.</content></utterance>
