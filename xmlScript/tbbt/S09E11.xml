<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Caption</speaker><content>It is a period of great tension. Our heroes, Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz and Koothrappali know that tickets to the new Star Wars movie are about to be available for pre-sale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Caption</speaker><content>If they fail in their mission and can’t see it on opening night Sheldon has sworn that they will never hear the end of it for the rest of their lives…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Caption</speaker><content>They believe him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, tickets already went on sale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re not supposed to be available yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what to tell you, but they’re on sale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait. You’re sure they’re Star Wars tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The Web site’s frozen. I can’t get in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Same here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Guys, they’re gonna sell out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are we gonna do?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Got ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I will continue to do so!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m really happy you and Amy are back together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m also really happy, but I can’t pretend it’s for you. New Star Wars in three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, Thursday can’t get here soon enough. I’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy’s birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn’t need anything in that case, ’cause it’s closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy’s birthday for me. Surprise, she’s even older. Who saw that coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, that’s nice. Put that on her cake.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh, great. This again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Arthur, what brings you back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn’t a, a sex dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the past, you’ve come to me when I’m struggling with a dilemma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What’s, what’s troubling you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>And they, they, they don’t wear underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Uh, do, do you love this girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>By seeing the movie she’d want me to see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I don’t know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy (answering phone)</speaker><content>Sheldon, what’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wanted to let you know I’ll be spending your birthday with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Obi-what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll, I’ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s late. Got to go. Bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. It’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. We’re going to the comic book store. You want to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I can’t. I need to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you’ll give it to someone worthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon (to Howard)</speaker><content>This is my ticket to Star Wars….</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What happens if I say, come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Bernadette.  Bernadette.  Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Just come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I’ll stream it on Netflix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re sorry. What do you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, as you know, I’ll be celebrating Amy’s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, so far, I’ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. You can really arrange that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it’s your birthday at Bennigan’s, they make a fuss. I don’t see why the Philharmonic would be any different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How about something a little more realistic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. She’d be going alone. Well, if you think I’m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, what’s the third option?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That I have coitus with her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you think about giving Sheldon’s ticket to Stuart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>My, uh, my doctor’s worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Hey, you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let’s, let’s, let’s just recap our options. All right, we’ve got harp thing, sheep thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wild thang.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which do you think she’d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, are you ready for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I’d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, that’s so beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then it’s settled. Amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thanks for taking me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So where do you want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t know. It was just a thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think I’ll just stick to Mexican.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, what is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What surprises?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We don’t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he’s ready to be physical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I, I can’t believe it. I, I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, we’re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I do know what to say. Let’s get me waxed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Why isn’t it ever Angie Dickinson’s bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>It, it doesn’t seem like it’s up to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose you’re here because I’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I’ve never done that before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, can you help me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh, good, good. ‘Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think they say junk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is an important night for us, and I’m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Sheldon, if, if you’re with the right person, it, it’ll be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, that’s, that’s very nice of you to say, but I think I’m just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Well, you’re fun to look at.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Tonight’s the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, the wait is finally over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. Then you’ll finally stop talking about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let’s do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Have fun, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re gonna have so much more fun than him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, they’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Knowing them, they will.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>T minus 15 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, did you hear from Wil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s on his way. Time for bladder check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Check. Wait. Screw it. I’m holding it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What is everyone booing at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hey, guys. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, hey, Wil. What you doin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Star Trek stinks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yeah? Live long and suck it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Birthday girl.  Birthday girl.  Birthday girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello. Sorry I’m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I’ll, I’m gonna go put these in water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you like it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s kind of spooky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can change it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no. It’s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, what’d you have in mind for tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Um, that sounds nice, but I’m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You mean before you give it to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are we saying give it to you like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. Is that all right? I’m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I’m gonna need verbal consent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, if you don’t like Star Wars, why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Oh, I’m just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie’s bad, it’s gonna ruin their lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It’s bad. Somebody kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>See? That’s what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn’t gonna change at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. No matter what happens, we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you think Sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. He said he’s ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, um, should I get under the covers with you?</content></utterance>
