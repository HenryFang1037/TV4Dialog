<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>It’s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o’clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, good God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That’s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Damn, there’s always a catch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leslie Winkle (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Because first-rate minds call you “dumbass”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? Well… you’re a mean person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Girl (arriving)</speaker><content>Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you’re just brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is the prevailing opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Oh, now I’m gonna throw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station’s Liquid Waste Disposal System.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Ew. Dr. Cooper, I’ve read everything you’ve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Woof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s what I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Again, ew. You know, I’d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t drink coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I do. I love me a cup of joe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Well, it doesn’t have to be coffee. How about dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do eat dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>What if I brought food to your place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>You got it. I already have your address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What a nice girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order.  See? Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>That’s okay. Guess I’m taking the stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Where you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>4-A.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, are you here to see Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>No, Dr. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Dr. Sheldon Cooper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>We’re having dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>He is cute, isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon Cooper?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Hi, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Ramona. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Thanks. Where should I put this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, the kitchen’s fine.  Hey, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I need to see this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Oh, sorry I’m late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My hypotheses tend to have that effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I’m sorry I didn’t bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>To watch, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, come on, now, we’re going out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, we’ll be quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny (in hallway)</speaker><content>Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what’s Sheldon’s deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean “deal”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, everybody has a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not Sheldon. Over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I’m an advocate of mytosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, do you want to hang out with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you guys gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My mom’s making a brisket tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The one with the little onions? Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m busy, so, goodnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Her loss. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not in these pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, how’d it go with Ramona last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, great. She’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ramona (arriving)</speaker><content>Here’s your spinach mushroom omelette .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Did anyone touch it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Touche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leslie (arriving)</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, hey Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>So, Sheldon, I see you’re organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>There won’t be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I’ll let you keep your lunch money today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you’re going to stay, you’ll have to be respectful and quiet. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>So have you worked out the neutrino issue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>You’re so witty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aren’t I?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys, this package came for y…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper is working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.   Holy crap on a cracker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. You know, you probably don’t want to go in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? What are they doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard (enters)</speaker><content>Hoo-boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper’s working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes, it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>You’re not going to Halo night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Didn’t a great man once say, “Science demands nothing less than the fervent and unconditional dedication of our entire lives”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>And who was that great man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Me. Sorry, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously? You’re not coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You heard her. How can I argue with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn’t waste an evening playing video games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He does on Wednesdays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Drat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Now shall we get back to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.  I guess I can wait for the DVD.  And then never ever watch it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Montage of scenes</speaker><content>To the sound of “You Can Be My Yoko Ono” by Barenaked Ladies  we see 1. the guys set off for paintball while Sheldon, dressed in paintball gear, sadly waves them goodbye, 2. Ramona catch Sheldon hiding behind the shower curtain playing on a Nintendo DS, 3. Ramona remove a book Sheldon is reading to reveal a Batman comic underneath, 4. Sheldon escape the apartment in his paintball gear only to be chased back inside by Ramona returning with groceries, she finds him sitting in his underpants with his paintball helmet still on.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, honey, I’ve told you, it’s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get rid of her how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ramona (off)</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hide me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hide you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I formally request sanctuary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Why aren’t you working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I know what’s going on here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>You’re in love with Dr. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, no, that’s not it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Don’t try to deny it. He’s a remarkable man, but you have to let him go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, gee, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>I know it’s hard, but he’s a gift to the whole world, and we can’t be selfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s a gift all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>Sisters?</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon?  What are you doing?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s Morse code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So we can communicate through the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We are communicating through the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know Morse code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s very simple. This is A  this is B  this is C…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t  Aw! What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. When is she going home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Never, that’s the problem. I need your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come on! Don’t nitpick!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. She’s in the living room. Go, I’ll wait here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Ramona (entering)</speaker><content>Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now! Do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Ramona</speaker><content>You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.</content></utterance>
