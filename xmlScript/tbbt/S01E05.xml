<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, I’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why don’t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi, you guys ready to order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And Orcs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll be back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll take the heart smart platter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We don’t eat here, I don’t know what’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s all good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Statistically unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that I’ll like the hamburgers here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can’t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because you are not at Big Boy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll have the Barbecue Burger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Make it two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Waitresses don’t yell at you at Big Boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Lesley (entering)</speaker><content>Hey Leonard, hi guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey Lesley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>I didn’t know you ate here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We don’t. This is a disturbing aberration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And walks in quiet beauty like the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard, I’ve asked you not to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lesley and I do research together at the University.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, wow, a girl scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I’m glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened to Elliot Wong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, why not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why at my place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn’t know you played the cello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you’re into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?  I’m actually not that into music. So hey, your friend’s really cute, anything going on with you two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-53"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-54"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-55"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-56"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She didn’t take my order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-57"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-58"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did Penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren’t they adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re a lucky man, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, what do you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said I could follow it, I didn’t say I cared.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>I admire your fingering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Goodnight guys, good job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Male string quartettist</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Female string quartettist</speaker><content>See you next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>You’re welcome. If you’re up for it we could practise that middle section again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, sure, why not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Just so we’re clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I’m sexually available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought you weren’t interested in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You mean my cello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I’m seducing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No kidding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>What can I say, I’m a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gee, uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Is it the waitress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny? What about her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you’re a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there’s no point in bringing it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>You and the waitress then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. No, there’s nothing going on between Penny and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>So, you’re open to a sexual relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Why don’t we finish the section first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m good, I’m good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Me too. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny (opening door)</speaker><content>Oh, hey Sheldon, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, sweetie, I know you think you’re explaining yourself, but you’re really not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just come with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What does it mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, you went to college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but I was eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re, you know, getting busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So you’re saying Leonard has a girl in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Lesley (voice off)</speaker><content>Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We really shouldn’t be standing here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon (entering living room)</speaker><content>This is very awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, you know, Leonard’s had girls over before, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, do you know who’s in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, there’s Leonard.  And he’s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930’s gangster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, wait, hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Gee, Sheldon, you’re asking the wrong girl. I’m usually on the other side of the tie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi, Leonard. It’s me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You’re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Big boy!  Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, what’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My equations, someone’s tampered with my equations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I’m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Lesley (entering)</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, I’ll see you at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who told you you could touch my board?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>No-one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t come into your house and touch your board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>There are no incorrect equations on my board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that is so… so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’ve got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard (exiting the apartment)</speaker><content>You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she’s still going to be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon (inside)</speaker><content>I’m not staring, I’m mulling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just pretty good, I’d think you were doing very good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, is it serious, do you like her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wuh, I don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions, uh, I’m not…. Sheldon, we have to go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, well, I’ll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, I’m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s not that intelligent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She fixed your equation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She got lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t believe in luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I still don’t care.</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Lesley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Careful  Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Because I’ve got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn’t find a knife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So anyway  Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Uh, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Okay, uh, what exactly do you think’s going on between us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not sure, but I think I’m about to discover how the banana felt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat’s brain, give him an orgasm button, he’ll push that thing until he starves to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who wouldn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can’t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That’s where you come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I’m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know about your sex drive, but I’m probably good till New Years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to make plans for New Years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Lesley</speaker><content>Woah, Leonard, please, you’re smothering me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard (leaving)</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, look, it’s Doctor Stud!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Doctor what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wha… how did it get on the internet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I put it there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, how did you know about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, that part’s true!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I won’t go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can’t grow soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how’s everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Terrific, you’ll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, oh yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, I don’t know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, to be honest, I don’t think it’s going to work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, oh that’s too bad. Well hey, don’t worry, I’m sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you even listening to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course I’m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. .</content></utterance>
