<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard and Raj (together)</speaker><content>Turtle power!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s heebie-jeebies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s working tonight, I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fun. We know how much you love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That should lighten the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy.  Amy. Oh, right, funeral.   Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy.  Amy.  Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>It’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I like rare chicken. Let’s do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You could die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Mrs. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Here’s another beer, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Mrs. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>It was good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Had no idea you were the chatty one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, not with that attitude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You, you want to rub something on my chest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. All over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe we should start with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I’m counting on it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, dig in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Took the words right out of my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>I’m going next weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, you like to fish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure. I can hear it in your voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Mrs. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Oh, if he didn’t like it, he wouldn’t go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, I hadn’t thought of that.  Help me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been talking my ear off all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, I think you’d have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Fine, you can tag along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, the thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>All right, it’s settled. You and I are going fishing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great.  Thanks for the help.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do either of you guys know how to fish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>S’up?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Step one, worms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you waiting for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. There.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You got this, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon (reading)</speaker><content>And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That was great. Rub my chest again. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How’s the poor thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t have a bath thermometer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So you’ve just been lying to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right. I’ll tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly.  You want me to stop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m fine. Keep going.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, never?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, Howard wins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re right. Oh! I should do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here we go. Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I feel terrible I did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you saying you want to spank me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>That’s what you’re wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Maybe in cartoons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>All right, let’s hit the road. I wouldn’t mind shooting some ducks in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait, now we’re shooting things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>I like using a big shell. You can’t eat them afterwards, but it’s fun watching them blow up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>So, why’d you agree to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>‘Cause Bernadette made me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>You’re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she’s only four feet tall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Ah. There’s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Mazel tov. I’ll teach you how to play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? Thank you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>Call me Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>That’s my wife and daughter you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great couple of gals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Mr. Rostenkowski</speaker><content>I wouldn’t go that far.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you prepared to receive your punishment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>One second. I want to put on some music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.</content></utterance>
