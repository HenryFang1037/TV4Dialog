<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, you remember that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how’s the detector going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Kind of like Sheldon’s ant farm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know this isn’t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you could have set Newton’s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can’t stand these scented markers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I like it. I think you’re on to something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do? You’re not messing with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re giving me a sticker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not a preschooler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll take it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I earned this. Back off.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re still awake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You worked out all the math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You wrote a paper on my idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wrote a paper on our idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When did my idea become our idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is good. Our idea is really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn’t gonna do it without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow, it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re sure it’s good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, partner, let’s do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come on. Click the mouse with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>One, two three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Click.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, we did, my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is your tongue blue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Search for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, no, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>‘Cause it would be fun to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It would be humiliating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, now we have two reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Please, can we watch it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, but I’m telling you, it’s terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Have you even seen it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Voice on TV</speaker><content>Bananas, get your fresh bananas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ho-ho, it really didn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Does it smell like blueberries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then we’re probably okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? What’d they say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Read another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who wrote that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s anonymous, and user name General Relativity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m responding to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, don’t lower yourself to their level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. There’s no upside to doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He just left another comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What does it say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Upon review, I’ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can I respond now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I’m about to show this guy just how horny I can be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Somebody else do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny (on television)</speaker><content>Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Why do you think you’re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny (on television)</speaker><content>Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, we’ve seen plenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, give me the remote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Careful. She’ll bite your fingers off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, I’ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I haven’t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Bernadette (on screen)</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You look like a talking cupcake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Bernadette (on screen)</speaker><content>And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to  tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Play it again. Play it again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did he respond yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. No, not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It wasn’t that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Read it back one more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you don’t think that’s too rough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>‘Cause it’s embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It is; it truly is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why? What did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. We are reading that right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, please don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But it’s personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, it’s about her and Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not about me and Sheldon. It’s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Please show us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know I’m gonna read it either way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good luck finding it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why? Why did it feel different?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I’m starting to miss that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you really want him to write back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me-wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s still so aggravating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>See? Better with the accent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And send.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did you write?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, okay, okay, calm down.  It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, really?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>“Time travel? I don’t understand,” said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‘Which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon’s kind of exhausting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It’s called good writing. And wishful thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, Amelia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>In the 1800s that was considered flirting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Never noticed that about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, do it. Call him. Let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Click it with me. One, two, three, click.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Stephen Hawking</speaker><content>Well, hello there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Hawking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Stephen Hawking</speaker><content>Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You really didn’t like our paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Stephen Hawking</speaker><content>I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then why are you attacking us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Stephen Hawking</speaker><content>If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you’d get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, that’s enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re just making fun of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I was just kidding. I’m sorry. And the story’s really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia’s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, “I can’t stay, but I will never forget you.” He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “Please don’t go,” she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But they didn’t even kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>“What about the future?” asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “There is no future without you.” He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not now!</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Amelia</speaker><content>Is the water warm enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cooper</speaker><content>Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it’s a little nippy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Amelia</speaker><content>I can fix that. I couldn’t help but notice your unusual undergarments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Cooper</speaker><content>They’re not undergarments. They’re Underoos. Where I come from, they’re known as underwear that’s fun to wear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Amelia</speaker><content>And what’s the significance of the spider?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Amelia</speaker><content>There’s a lot of rhyming in the future, isn’t there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Leonard (in bed)</speaker><content>You’re right. This is even weirder than I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want me to stop reading?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you kidding? No, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>As he stood for Amelia to dry him…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Amelia</speaker><content>So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, I’m good.</content></utterance>
