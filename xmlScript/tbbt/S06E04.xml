<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’ll be good to have him back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The Fantastic Four reunited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard’s gym membership.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you’re the tiebreaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I can go thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Welcome aboard, old chum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don’t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We’re on the ground! We survived!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Man in Suit</speaker><content>That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s coming back from outer space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Man in Suit</speaker><content>I think this flight’s coming from Houston.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I mean, he… Never mind. There he is! Howie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Various others (all at once)</speaker><content>Howie! Howie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howie Mandel</speaker><content>Uh, I think they’re here for me, Ringo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Man in Suit</speaker><content>Mr. Mandel, I’m your driver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howie Mandel</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he’s an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I missed you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I missed you, too. Where are the guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, it’s just me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I get it. They’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don’t worry, I can act surprised. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gesundheit. You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I am now that you’re back. Come on, let’s go home so I can tear off those little pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Me, too. But we’ll see him tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How about boys versus girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Once again, unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, once again, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, round one. Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Ready, set, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, box? Uh, window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, gift? Uh, Present!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Present! Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In what universe is that a present?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not a present, it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, we’re gonna kill them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a quark-gluon plasma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing with quarks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s a chocolate chip cookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How could you miss that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Relax, we got time, this is so fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, that’s enough. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yep!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll be right there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s just allergies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Took some Benadryl. I’ll be fine. So, did you miss me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette (has a coughing fit)</speaker><content>Ew. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sweetie, we don’t have to do this now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Now, kiss me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Bernadette (waking suddenly)</speaker><content>That was amazing. You made me feel things I never… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I wonder if it’s from, like, ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, come on, what is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>En el acelerador de particulares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bueno, mi amigo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just pick another game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No good, Sheldon doesn’t float.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, let’s keep it simple. How about darts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that’s not fair either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s when it started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they’re all out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few, but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain’s on the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard? I thought I wasn’t going to see you till tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, Bernie’s not feeling well, so I thought I’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I’m not decent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right. Woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she’s not decent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Man’s Voice (off)</speaker><content>You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Shh, you need to whisper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma, who is in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Uh, nobody. The TV is on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Man’s Voice (off)</speaker><content>I only got one sock. Where’s my other sock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I told you, it’s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it’s hilarious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you’re busy, I can come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard (to man climbing out window)</speaker><content>Dr. Schneider?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Dr Schneider</speaker><content>Oh, hello, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Dr Schneider</speaker><content>Um, house call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re a dentist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Dr Schneider</speaker><content>Yes, yes, I am. I think he’s on to us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hurry up, find him, find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know what he looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, there he is, I got him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, we win again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How could you not find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There’s Waldo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>57, 58, 59, that’s one minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Long division, long division. Go, go, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Remember, show your work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Get up, we can’t lose at math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>37.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ready, set, wrestle.  One, two, three, pin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mwah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stop that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mwah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One to beam aboard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, my God, you’re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I’m like an inch and a half taller. I’m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, Bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, hey, man, welcome back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I, I kind of live here now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Ah, he’s spoiling me and I love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, so you guys are like buds now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Plus, he doesn’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Which part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Just all of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that’s cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, Howard, it’s still our thing. Come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So I’d be sitting by myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So I, I, I’d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no, you guys go. Have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Absolutely. See you, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.</content></utterance>
