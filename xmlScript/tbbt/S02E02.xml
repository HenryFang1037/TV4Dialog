<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Worst Renaissance Fair ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Please let it go, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re nitpicking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. They’re about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny (arriving with a man in tow)</speaker><content>Hi guys. Looks like you’ve been to the Renaissance fair. I’m hoping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, yeah, good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, it’s good to see you too. We should really go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny(leaving)</speaker><content>Bye guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Eric (leaving, to Howard)</speaker><content>Like your hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>By moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re wearing modern underwear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You went out and bought linen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Borrowed?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you saying that you’ve been holding back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course. Out of respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Who were you respecting then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Doesn’t count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re only saying that because of what happened to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>N-n-n-nothing happened to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It wasn’t your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What about Leslie Winkle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think she’s smoking hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’d hit that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I like Leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it.  And he told me his name was Kimberley!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If we were, the food would be better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leslie (arriving)</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hey, dummy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where did you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you’re unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>No, I’m all done with casual sex. From now on I’m fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really, what changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>It’s hard to say, I guess there’s just a time in every woman’s life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Anyway, I just figure it’s time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Your place, we’ll order Chinese, you’ll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>I’ll leave the details up to you, I think it’s better if you assume the male role.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, that’s very thoughtful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Great. Call me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I kind of have other plans tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s a date, I have a date coming over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, statistically speaking…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want me to leave the apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well alright then.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon? What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well then don’t order popcorn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well why don’t you go to a coffee shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t drink coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>They have other things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do they have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, you know, cookies, pastries…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pastries such as bearclaws?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t like bearclaws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leslie (entering)</speaker><content>Heya Penny. Dumbass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they’re both scientists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I’m just enabling you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>This is pretty good Orange Chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s from Changs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Not Chows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, Changs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>What happened to Chows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have?  I’m sorry, that was a little abrupt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I sure hope so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>I’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there’s the lactose intolerance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon (preparing an extension cord)</speaker><content>Don’t forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.  What now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have to make pee-pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I think tonight was a very good start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Me too. You’re sure you’re okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No problem, I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I’m not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Again, it’s your decision, you’re the man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny (voice off, ascending the stairs)</speaker><content>No, it wasn’t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Eric (appearing round corner with Penny)</speaker><content>From the Charlie Brown cartoons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, goodnight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, goodnight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Leslie (whispering)</speaker><content>That ain’t going to make your point.  Okay, that’s enough.  Call me </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Penny (breaking off kiss)</speaker><content>Okay, goodnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Had a great time, ciao </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, there’s so few places I can wear my jester costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean like Spock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fascinating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leslie (arriving)</speaker><content>Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hmm, let’s do it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t make this hard for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right, it is simple. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know, I still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Goodnight Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, where is this coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your arch enemy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, come back, you’re losing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She called me dumbass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. I heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that response is unacceptable to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you going to let me talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let me put it this way, if you’re really Leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because love trumps hate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh now you’re just making stuff up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I’d like to have a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If the word is pee-pee, just do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m listening, amuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Are you going to let him talk to me like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>No there isn’t, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hope so, it was a snort of derision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Well, I’m glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Truth, what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>Oh, it isn’t, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>We can’t let them choose, Leonard, they’re children. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leslie</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look on the bright side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s the bright side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Only nine more months to comic-con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.</content></utterance>
