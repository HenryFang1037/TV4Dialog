<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you, but I’ve never seen you play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That one over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Skee-Ball tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, if I still have them, they’re probably in the junk box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, what are you gonna get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yup, oh, here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, did she hate you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you barely looked. Let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, let me look in the box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It’s a spider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, if it was a spider, Lenny would’ve flipped out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I’ll, I’ll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean it, I’m going to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you’re going to stay calm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know how to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s stupid. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m telling you, try the hanger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Put it on. Let’s share the experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How those nipples feeling, chief?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Penny, can we please get our drinks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my gosh. That’s the girl that broke Rajesh’s heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s Lucy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think that reason’s called racism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m gonna go talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why? What are you gonna say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who’s racist now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You because you just called him your Indian friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you’re short.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re never getting our drinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, but we knew that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Oh, water would be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Wow. How’s he doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you know, he’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Any chance I can get a different waitress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>I don’t know your e-mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Oh, I thought you said he was okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, you can never take it off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not even to sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, you’re just an idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s called proving a point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is the point that you’re an idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You didn’t have Smokey the Bear in India?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You had to be taught not to play with cobras?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We did, you never brought it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not even close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You want to say sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Then you made her cry and leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, what’re you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s a pretty cool idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or it’s resolved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I believe this is yours.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I ask you guys a question? So, I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can’t let her know you’re hurting. You know, the key is confidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, can I say she looks nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I tell her I miss her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe, if she asks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’d save that for the second date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s a principle at stake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Which is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Smile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is that? What is that for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m gonna go with sad. So what’s the story with you and this DVD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please. Ha-ha, Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello. Oh, it’s so good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>You, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>I’m pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Oh, uh, I’m kind of seeing someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is all your fault, I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I love you, Penny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, that was diabolical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?</content></utterance>
</scene>
