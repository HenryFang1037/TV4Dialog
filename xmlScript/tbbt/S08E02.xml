<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What a sick use of science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, as long as the baby’s healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But half-man, half-owl could fly…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, Penny, when’s the new job start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Next Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, not yet, but I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great. When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I said I’ll get to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sensing awkwardness, am I right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Swish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They’ll tell me everything I need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher’s pet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Couldn’t hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, I don’t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Mrs. Davis.  Guess who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> That’s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Yes. Uh, welcome back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Currently, you’re being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you’ll be able to choose whatever field of research you’d like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But if I’m a professor, then I’ll have to teach a class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>That is correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Mrs Davis</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You people are sick.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. Ready to go to lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just give me a minute. I’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What happens if you don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, no. Actually, I didn’t invite her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won’t stop bugging me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I told you, they’ll be right out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, so no Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I just need a little break from her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what are you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank’s problem?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, I’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why is it your last name and her first name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, how’d it go with human resources?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What a stupid question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The kids are gonna love him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they’re wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn’t mean I always do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You enjoy giving people grades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And you love the sound of your own voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It’s like an earful of melted caramel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That’s rich. I’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don’t you? That’s right, say my name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette (on skype)</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not tonight. I’m a little frustrated with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So it’s not just me. You see it, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I do, I see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s outrageous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There is no class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No one signed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, that’s not your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they’re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I’d throw the cookies away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, what if I took your class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don’t think you’d understand a single thing I was talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ask why not again, I’ve got an answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m more than smart enough to take your class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’d use Feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I’ll say that. Now do you think I’m smart enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on. You might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You take that back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I’m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because it’s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I’m in the centre now, and I love that even more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But I’m just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You better watch that attitude, buddy. You’re dating the popular girl now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm. You’re up late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don’t really understand it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, why are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m a teacher, Leonard. It’s my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s no trouble, it’s actually a pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting point. You’re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Might be something to think about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard’s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I’m out. But if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I’m willing to give this a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose that’s a fair request. There’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s an inverted cycloid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s where I’m a little fuzzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard (singing)</speaker><content>All I do is win, win, win no matter what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard (singing)</speaker><content>Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then I’m gonna be a crappy student.  Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause I never been defeated and I won’t stop now…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, where was I? Let’s see. Oh, yes. Over here. You… What are you doing now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Making a straw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So I can shoot you with a spitball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re not going to do that, and I’ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don’t think I can do that again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy (on phone)</speaker><content>Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, thanks, but I think I’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I’d come by and help her study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She’s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Great. I’m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can’t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? It just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You reported me to human resources?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You violated the sanctity of my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you’re happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you you weren’t smart enough to take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. I could do the same to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, try me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Young’s modulus.</content></utterance>
