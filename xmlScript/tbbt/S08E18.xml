<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’d say I’m sorry I asked, except I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, look, it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that can’t be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Poor Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He might not be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’d be incensed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So you see what I’m getting at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Squeaky wheel gets the grease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Grass is always greener?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Try again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know, we’re all Groot? Just tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He’s going to feel bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, it’s hard. A lot of Ma’s stuff brings back fond memories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, your name is on the electric bill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, right. This is a disaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, I have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did they hate it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So what’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know how the PennySaver only has my name…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, that, that’s not necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Cooper and his team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You should know I had nothing to do with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stuart, we’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey. Just so you know, the power’s out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I called, they said a transformer blew. It’s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait, when did it go out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>In the middle of the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, what’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s all defrosting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay. It’s just food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. All Ma’s food is gonna be ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What should we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna eat it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. Then how about this? Let’s invite everyone over to dinner. It’ll be like Ma’s feeding us one last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me, too. Oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I mean, who even reads Scientific American?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s kind of a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we please just stop talking about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry. What can I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are we doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I am taking you shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My baby is sad, and I’m gonna make him happy again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does it have a camera in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It does have a camera in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Baby’s listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up.  Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All he had was an idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that is an important part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But Leonard’s idea was good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m the one who thought of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, look at that pretty bird.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did she throw anything away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, that’s noodle kugel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m never gonna talk to her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Should we tell everyone not to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. I want to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not making any promises.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Glad you guys could make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, it looks really pretty in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And there goes the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Subtle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But you got it, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey. Hi. Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you need any help in the kitchen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, hey, you two, we’re here for Howard right now, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, so please behave yourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How’s that going?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This food is amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not true. We’ve got tomatoes right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, so it’s like The View.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I would like to propose a salon topic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh, please do, Rajesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, who’s Tor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It’s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, please. His mother just died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re being ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, so are you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I’d go to my real salon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-37"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want some of this? I’ll give you some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-42"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She said my name first, that must kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-44"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I’m talking to you. And don’t think…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-45"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-46"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-47"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, not at all.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Ra</speaker><content>So glad you two are done fighting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right now, I’m just trying to burp without throwing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What’d they say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Good news, I found more Tums.</content></utterance>
