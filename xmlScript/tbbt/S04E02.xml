<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Killed by badger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can always get a badger and find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That long, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>By this much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Tough break. You want eggs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s a dogapus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is somebody working on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait a minute. You hate dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do we owe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Never mind. I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you wanted me to pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm? How much you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How can you walk around with no money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m cute. I get by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s okay, you can owe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, six bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a small price to pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, don’t ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Essentially, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>You’re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it won’t. Um, how does he know I jog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, that is so creepy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know!  And he says he’s not gonna stop.  Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content> Ugh.  U-u-ugh.  Lenu-u-ugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell? What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Have you had your appendix out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s get you to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Funny how things work out, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst!  On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny.  Penny.  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. They’re my mother’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna run really fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about your pedometer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. I just run till I’m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you doing that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’ll never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let’s just warm up on the run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Penny (squealing)</speaker><content>Oh, my God, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, let me help you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Palak paneer, that’s Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, what’s my share?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, 12 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What am I up to now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny (after Raj whispers to Howard and they both laugh)</speaker><content>What now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not free, I’m gonna pay him back.  Shut up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you gonna join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Coming! . Greetings, friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Greetings, whatever the hell you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>Really? That’s your question? When did he put a ramp in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re in your bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>No, I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am looking at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>At the hands of your roommate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>An accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s how I’m going to make it look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, but don’t expect my help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll be damned.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>This is delightful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>Because I called shotgun. Remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s it. Bye-bye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on)</speaker><content>Bazinga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>I have an override switch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I almost died!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon-bot </speaker><content>And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m still going to go with you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon-bot </speaker><content>Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon-bot </speaker><content>Be a lamb and open it for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? What’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon-bot </speaker><content>You think you have me stymied, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, look, it’s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon-bot </speaker><content>Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon-bot </speaker><content>He’s a lamb. You’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m a lamb.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon-bot </speaker><content>Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s two, dude. Write your own jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you introducing yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon-bot </speaker><content>Can you tell me the specials this evening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m not waiting on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon-bot</speaker><content>Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because you’re not here.</content></utterance>
