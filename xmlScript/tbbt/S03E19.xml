<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do or do not. There is no try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you just quote Star Wars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Oh. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, no, I, I’m, I’m glad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good. Glad is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it’s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, probably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, good night, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you saying he’s man-struating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I honestly don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Would that be a giant rat’s ass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For the record, giant rats are possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, there was no spat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, but something happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m just asking, dude. It happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You guys still on for bowling tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh. Ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is what is referred to as a burn on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you ask her to start waxing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you start waxing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m walking away from you now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That wasn’t a no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I think we’re getting close.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, that would be a good way to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, right, bowling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thinly veiled contempt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remember, seven o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pacific Daylight time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bite me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>These are my own bowling shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then what’s with the disinfectant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know where my feet have been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn’t make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>You’re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>It tells me that I am living rent-free right here . You ready to bowl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Great. Then it’s on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes.  Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I just wanted to tell you I’m a big fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Oh, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Chilli cheese fry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? You love them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you really want to get into this right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How can you not be sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t push it, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am not pushing anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I love you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ah, the premature I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guessed premature. Does that count?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny,  Penny,  Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ice cream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, Ach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did Leonard send you over here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Again, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, that’s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I’ll get back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When are you going to talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think we should talk now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, we’re good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The Wesley Crushers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Still don’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing Wesley, it’d be the “Wesley” Crushers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hey, look. They named their team after me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s not the… Never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So, we’re all clear on the bet and the stakes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Ouch again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I’m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>After you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>It’s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>It’s a custom, not a rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I so loathe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>That’s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s not even from your franchise!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I, um, I want you to know that even though we’re on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what’s-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I’m gonna bowl now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Be the ball, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leave me alone, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You weren’t the ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is fun, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s good that we got out and did something physical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>All (chanting)</speaker><content>Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>All (chanting)</speaker><content>The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-45"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I’m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-46"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-47"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>It’s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you’re not ready for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-48"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-49"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn’t sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-50"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-51"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-52"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-53"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yeah, would have been kinder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-54"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Wil, you’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-55"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Oh, that’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-56"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-57"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-58"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-59"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-60"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-61"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-62"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-63"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, you’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-64"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-65"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-66"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We really need a strike here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-67"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-68"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So just take your time and concentrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-69"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, stop pressuring me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-70"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not pressuring you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-71"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you are! Just back off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-72"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-73"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t mean shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-74"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-75"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-76"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-77"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-78"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-79"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m pretty sure it’s already over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-80"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Tough luck, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-81"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You did this, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-82"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-83"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I suppose not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-84"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Good. Keep thinking that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-85"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wheaton!</content></utterance>
