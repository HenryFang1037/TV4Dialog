<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fellas, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard (entering on the phone)</speaker><content>I’m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not a clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about that, you were right.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s out of order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Yes, I can read the sign, I’m just pondering the implications.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You must be Leonard’s mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard’s Mother</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know if I must be, but yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard’s Mother</speaker><content>Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, you’re a hand shaker. Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>All right, you start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. You know, I’ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, I think you mean young. He’s always been little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>You’ll have to be more specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, well, I’m an actress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you mean why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t know what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>And then, I’m assuming, you entered adolescence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good to see you, Mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s your tea, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oolong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Loose, not bagged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Steeped three minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Two-percent milk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Warmed separately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>One teaspoon sugar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Raw sugar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>It’s cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll start again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content> Oh, I don’t know where he would’ve gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Yes, we think so. We’ve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, it’s all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I’m sorry, it’s on my other laptop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aw…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Mother, what’s new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>You’ll have to be more specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right. Uh, what’s new with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, well, I’ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe something less personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What a remarkable woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I envy you your childhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Please, don’t go there, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I understand that unlike Leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Boy, you suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, Leonard’s younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, she’s close to curing diabetes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, you must be very proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Why? They’re not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I’ll have to try again later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>So, where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>That’s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliché.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s just temporary, I pay rent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one’s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Say what?  That’s basically what I just said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Leonard, it’s one o’clock, weren’t you going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>But it’s one o’clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>So, no original research?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, what’s the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why is it always my responsibility?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t believe you’re bringing that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I didn’t bring it up. You did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ll talk about this later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You always say that, but we never do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You went to the comic book store without me.7</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You got alcohol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your mom still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Geez, what a fun couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can’t let her get into your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My head, what about yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you get the part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, they said I was too perky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your mother told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A hugging machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that is so sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what the saddest part was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My father used to borrow it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Common complaint among men. Nothing’s ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t believe that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Understandable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can I make you a cup of tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it’s probably you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I feel very comfortable around you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I feel very comfortable around you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Nor I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d like to do the math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I’d like that, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, now this time…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Neck, shot, lime.  Okay, shot, lime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. Ah! Where’s the lime?  Oh, okay, we’re sharing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I’m very tempted. I’m just not sure it’s appropriate with my son’s roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>True. I’ve had a similar observation. It’s certainly something I could never do with my husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I see what you’re doing. You’re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You see right through me, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Only when you’re in a CAT scanner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is actually gonna happen.</content></utterance>
