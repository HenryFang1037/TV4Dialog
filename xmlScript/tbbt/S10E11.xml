<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Here comes another contraction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Let’s pick it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right, hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stop that, this isn’t India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I love you, too. We’re good.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy? Wake up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s midnight. Happy birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I love it. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is that okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny (off)</speaker><content>Guys, wake up. Bernadette’s having her baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard (off)</speaker><content>Come on, we’re going to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess, I guess we should stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Midwife</speaker><content>Now I see three of you. Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m the father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Midwife</speaker><content>Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No idea. Ask him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>12 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Midwife</speaker><content>12 minutes? Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Aren’t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Midwife</speaker><content>This is a hospital, not the airport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry. It’s our first time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Midwife</speaker><content>It’s okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we’re having?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, we’re keeping it a surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Midwife</speaker><content>Old school. Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not that old school. He knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Midwife</speaker><content>Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Midwife</speaker><content>I’m just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what took you so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Damn, I need my inhaler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just don’t smoke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I went down the stairs too fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny (answering phone)</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, first deliveries can be slow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I found it, but it’s empty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure? I’d really like to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, should we, uh, head back up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, uh, I don’t know. Sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday, you decide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We could go to a bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a bit childish, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Grape. I find it the most mild.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, you two go have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you really need to record this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, enough with the camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I, I said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You’re doing great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, okay, I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How could you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You told me it was a girl, and I didn’t say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You were supposed to keep that to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, shall we start over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood’s a little different now. We, we don’t have to rush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it, and I don’t want to disappoint them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And the mood continues to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, and also, I don’t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not about trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Stop talking about trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s killing the mood now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t until I heard that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj (off)</speaker><content>Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they’re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can I look yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I’d let Harry Potter make things hotter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wowza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I got a Gryffindor robe for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I did. Am I in trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, you’re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wait, what just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know I’ve been wanting to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh. Happy birthday to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj (off)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is this about the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good. Then you’re used to this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Bernadette’s water broke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, everyone to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You have got to be kidding me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m not an old man, I just can’t see at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call ’em out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>:21,369 –&gt; 00:12:23,536</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it is their child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Deep breaths, slow breaths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I’ll go get some more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We could name her after your mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Debbie? No. She hated that name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did she have a middle name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Melvina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let’s keep thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ah. It sucks that she’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hm. She would’ve been the best grandma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She did always have candy in her pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we’ve all come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hmm. You two got married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon and I are living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Howard went to space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bernadette got her doctorate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’ve all come a long way. There’s a lot to be proud of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>What’s your problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Raj, if it’s any consolation, I’m no better off than I was ten years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, I’m in a hospital and I’m not the patient. I’m fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you want me to get the nurse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn’t swallow it, but Amy said it counted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, great, now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I’ll still help you move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anyone else want to try?</content></utterance>
