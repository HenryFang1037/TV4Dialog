<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t you want to know for sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? It didn’t work for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you think the moms will get along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Shelly, I’m so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, thank you, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What did they feed the lions, Mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Are you ashamed of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, we’re kind of taking it slow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>You’ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there’s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Only satisfactory. I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I change my answer. It, it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Why? Are you attracted to her, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Where is she from again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>East Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Ugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, look who’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Of course I did, but it’s a mother’s job to make sure her child’s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone’s approval.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>: So nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Very pleasant. And yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Subtle, mom, real subtle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We talked about this. I don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>You must be very proud of your son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>He did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he’s terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Calm down, dear. Mary, I’m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh, this is a good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn’t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, he was a handful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was a handful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Clearly, you’ve never seen me try to talk to a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Guys. In the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I put on pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Kiss-ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, I don’t even live here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I do. And some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>You don’t look very happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Shelly does not like change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Hello. Oh, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry, I forgot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You remember my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Good to see you again, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, Mom, you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It came from Tiffany’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean the box, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Keep walking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did I misspeak about the ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you are a super weaner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Uch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Uch? The bible is uch to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>No, I’m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people’s superstitions can be to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>His name is Sigmund Freud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Stay out of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>It’s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>I know the answer. You’re not gonna like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Try me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>: It means, I can’t believe we’re having this conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How old is this Jell-O?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, it’s carrots, so gonna say very.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry we have to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Bernadette’s not wrong. She does work hard around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She doesn’t baby me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I saw her pull you home in a wagon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>I’m terribly sorry that I upset your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>I can’t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>But look how well you turned out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>I suppose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Do you suppose you would’ve flourished more in a reward-based environment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, I’m sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>When your mom gets back, I’m gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter, a good Christian would’ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would’ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who’s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Coming up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t really feel I deserve it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Looks good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>I’m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>And I will pray for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>One moment. There’s something I need to say to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, really? That’s too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there’s more than one way to raise a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I taught her that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow. When does that start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>So needy. Come to Mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s okay, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Dr Hofstadter</speaker><content>Oh, my son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my mother.</content></utterance>
