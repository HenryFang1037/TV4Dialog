<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, Howard, that’s very nice of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe. Open it first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s my official NASA portrait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart, I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time’s the charm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thanks, but I can’t afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, you don’t worry about money. I’ll take care of everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But you know what wasn’t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it’s your last night on Earth. You’d think you’d get one porn channel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don’t go there for the food, you go there for the view.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I hope so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Question. Do you think your husband’s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not getting any better.  Ugh. It’s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I thought you liked Halloween.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I do, it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Like my husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And my boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m, I’m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard’s foreskin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we’re going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that, like, his job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then what’s your job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Letting him make me happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I guess I could probably try a little harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You could start by taking an interest in his work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s kind of a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not really clear on what he does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s an experimental physicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m not really clear on what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re really just making it worse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What kind of tea would you like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think I’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I couldn’t agree more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see America’s most beloved and glamorous couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don’t even like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re hopped up on tea bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can’t we find something that we’re both happy with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anybody home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, what a nice surprise. I don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I know. It’s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh! What’s going on in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, is it secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sign right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is a pencil sharpener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s actually pretty neat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. That is amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you mean? . Oh! Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  just be information  on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.  So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sometimes I forget how smart you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You should visit more often. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Take off your clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Here? Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. You got a problem with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around in the lab before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Never?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Before I forget, I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>On Sesame seed Bunzillas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Night of the Living Garlic Bread?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello, boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you smiling at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Space.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, we need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, I know you went to space. I’m incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t talk about it every minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, I did this amazing thing and I’m never allowed to mention it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, no problem. It won’t happen again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love you, too. I can’t tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was… you know. What, I can’t even point?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whoa! That’s heavy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whoa! That is very cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the super villain Magneto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Getting a little less cool, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>There we go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A Tardis makes no sense. It’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don’t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you have a preference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t care. Get the Tardis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes! This party just became a major rager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones’ mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Clever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, Howard, I’ve got a party to plan. Don’t make me pull it out of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you’re doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s called being nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I’ll try it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at that, the problem solved itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello, boys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I don’t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it’s a lost cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he’s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s a hickey?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How do I look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that’s like the funniest thing I’ve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>To tell you the truth, I’m not really in the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What are you talking about? It’ll be fun. All your friends’ll be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, some friends. They all think I’m boring. Maybe you should go without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, if I’m there alone, people might think I’m just a really short person from Avatar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I just don’t want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I’m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, well, now you’re a Smurf. Keep walking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And Albert Einstein?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I thought we said in the car, no accents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, Officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Girl dressed as a Witch</speaker><content>Hello. It’s a great party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Witch</speaker><content>The monster foods, they’re really fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I’m fun. I’m not clinically depressed at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, get in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I should’ve picked hickey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, hey, look at you guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m Raggedy Ann, and he’s Raggedy C-3PO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was a compromise. I lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who cares?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ’s on fire, there’s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.</content></utterance>
