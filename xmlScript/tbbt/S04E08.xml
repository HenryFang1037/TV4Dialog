<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That’s how I learned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And I can’t believe you’ve never read Eat, Pray, Love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I’ll read it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>I don’t care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I’m not reading it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, which I’ve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it’s really scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, 21 seconds? That’ll be like seeing a whole new movie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did Leonard? I’m no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh, good. I’m eight for 26 this month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I think I’ll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. I’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See? Howard’s on my side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Actually, I’m not. I’m using sarcasm to mock you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But how were our seats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excellent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I rest my case. Amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shrewd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Leonard, you’re right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>See? It’s working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Knock-knock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who’s there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Olive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Olive you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, that’s really starting to get old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Knock-knock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who’s there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have a girlfriend and you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hysterical!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, now, we don’t know that yet. He isn’t finished. I have a girlfriend and you don’t who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So. Are you sure you don’t want to come with us to Raiders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls’ night tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Girls’ night? What does that entail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I’ll ask Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No need. Penny and I are very close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, but they’re not girls. I’m a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What’s the dress code?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, just wear something comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right. I’ll have to go shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Knock-knock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who‘s there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hugh who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hugh people need to listen to me. It’s time to get in line for the movie. And that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Under normal circumstances I’d say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh. Can’t wait for that to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I informed you thusly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Eight for 28.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And here’s where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So I guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us–</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, shut up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Shame. ‘Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Penny, your nails look great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It’s in a woman’s basement. I think it’s a front</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Or we could just stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Gee, I don’t know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s okay. Y ou can just sleep here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, good, a slumber party! We’ll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, gosh, Amy. I don’t know if I would call this an actual slumber party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s disappointing. I’ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, you never were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not even when you were a kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn’t make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Well, I guess we’re having a slumber party. Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Pillow fight!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s a stadium pal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We might not get seats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s fine, it’s fine. Go back to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You’re peeing, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Hey, look who’s here! Hey, buddies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Mee-sa think that very funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Theatre Staff</speaker><content>Wil Wheaton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Theatre Staff</speaker><content>I’m a big fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of what? Poorly executed beards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie? We got here a little late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Theatre Staff</speaker><content>No problem. Come on, I’ll hook you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Calm down, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know what I really love about Howard? His chest hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard has a hairy chest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, just the one. But it’s really long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, oh, uh, looks like they’re getting ready to let people in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only going to upset you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me.  Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I’m a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it’s your game. You go first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hang on. I’m familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Um.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Remember, you have to answer honestly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait. No, Amy, you’re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Theatre staff</speaker><content>Guys, I am sorry. We are full up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Theatre staff</speaker><content>We’re full up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Theatre staff</speaker><content>Sorry. Fire regulations. Should’ve gotten here earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Theatre staff</speaker><content>‘Cause I’m the petty functionary with the clipboard, bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess that’s that. Let’s go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what? I’m going back to I told you so. I told you so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess we’d better go after him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Short Round?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Indy’s young sidekick from Temple of Doom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What the hell was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller’s Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, that’s an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Dare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. I mean, Leonard’s a great guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. He got really serious, and I wasn’t ready for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You can only ask one question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Amy and Bernadette together</speaker><content>That one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what, I don’t want to play anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon? Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Where did he go?  We’re looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You whistled?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can’t see it, no one else can see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.</content></utterance>
