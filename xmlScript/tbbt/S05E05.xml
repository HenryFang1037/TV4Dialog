<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did you have in mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It would be a replica of a movie prop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s okay, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay? It’s magnificent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let’s say 250?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s pretty steep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, it’s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on. Can you do any better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I’m already giving you the friends and family discount.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Slow down. Two hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will you shut up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Tell you what, I’ll go two thirty-five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nope. Maybe another time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Take it, take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Two hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Man, you’re killing me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Killing you? I can’t breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Two ten, and I’m losing money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Are you crazy? That helmet’s signed by Robert Downey Jr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, if you’re going to question the importance of an actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thank you. I can eat meat this week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See that? I just saved us forty bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You want me to wrap it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Wil Wheaton (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Ah, hey, Wil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, Wil Wheaton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not surprised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-51"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Here’s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-52"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Awesome. What do I owe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-53"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Forty bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-54"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Good deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-55"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-56"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hey, I’m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-57"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Will there be girls there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-58"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yeah, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-59"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>‘Cause there wasn’t last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-60"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-61"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-62"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>All right, great. Later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-63"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-64"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was actually thinking about going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-65"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-66"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-67"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, great, more guys. It’s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, can you grab me a water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Possibly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can you or can’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not that simple, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It never is, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it. Can I have my water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, what is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard (arriving)</speaker><content>Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mohammed Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who’s Mohammed Lee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space! Technically, I’m an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Wow, that’s amazing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are those Russian rockets safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Cheers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That was a lovely toast. Kudos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine. Just a little tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I always catch your drift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Just stop talking, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What did you think was going to happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Honestly? Sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Pretty cool about Howard, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You never stop talking, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Mortal enemy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>A floppy disk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I started the list when I was nine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh! Oh, God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love you, too. So, sex now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be right back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m ready.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Obviously.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I do, with all my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Got it. Just had to check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He’s great.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to drive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Brent Spiner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.</content></utterance>
</scene>
