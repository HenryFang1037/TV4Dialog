<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And here’s another interesting weather fact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Another? Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I will miss this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That criticism will come later in your report card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna read the report card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard (in Penny’s apartment)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny (screams)</speaker><content>Leonard! Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Keep your voice down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that is so romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, sure, that’s why I did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d rather just sell it to a real collector.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m a real collector. How rare is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind in Spider-Man’s body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Both versions: original and Lohan. You’re an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, what’s your problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s probably this stupid diet I’m on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why are you on a diet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men’s section.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna love this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh, it’s pretty rare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.  Oh, that’s the pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yep. Here’s some money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Pizza guy</speaker><content>Twenty-two fifty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Pizza guy</speaker><content>Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.  Have a good night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What, now, do you have company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I can take a look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. Ask a silly question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s odd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There are takeout containers in the trash can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So? That’s my dinner from last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I made some brownies. You want one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why can’t she do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I feel so stupid. And fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then what does tweepadock mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, elephant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Lucky guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re being ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Poor Leonard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you hear anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hear a woman’s voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is it Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, Sheldon, don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right.   Penny.  Penny.  Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, he doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Please leave me out of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, I said I was sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello, sailor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, now we’re talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks for coming over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a brie in the oven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it’s kind of hard to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you want my help or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, they kind of do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hmm. Uh, let me see something. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay.  I mean, yeah, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.  Ooh, brie’s ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where do you think I would take you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to work. You can come if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I’ll give you that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. What I did was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wish I could believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Keep it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Driving Sheldon to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thought I heard you out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. You’re either with me or against me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You want to take the bus to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Maybe there’s a third option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, Raj. Judas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? You’re a crazy person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A little loud, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m so glad you guys are friends again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fifty cents off Vagisil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Think of me when you apply it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that happened right after you left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And no one told me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Howard (crying)</speaker><content>Can’t believe we forgot to tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon)</speaker><content>Think of Sheldon when you apply it.</content></utterance>
