<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, actually, I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great, what’d you have in mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look, we can’t just throw away Penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure she misses this one. I mean, it’s the greatest gift I’ve ever given anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What happened to them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy wants me to have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But it’s a picture of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But you commissioned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>To give to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But you like it so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So do you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I seem to be losing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why don’t you keep it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, take the plant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you’re not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>A foot massage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And that’s not me being creepy, that’s for either of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This is very nice Stuart, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you’re gonna need all the help you can get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you, but I’m not really sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That woman didn’t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thank you. And it’s only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When would you move in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I’m gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I’m gonna go vacuum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, then I’ll dust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I did that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Then I’ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard just did that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, let him do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock</speaker><content>Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s one of a kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So if it breaks there’d be none of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you think you should keep it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Keep the clock, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let me guess, you want it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, now they’re yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? There is one thing I would like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, take whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But you don’t even like flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I like this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I designed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But you don’t even understand its symbolism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come along, Amy. I know when I’m not wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t think you do, but all right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart, you cooked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How did you know it wasn’t me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard (door bell rings)</speaker><content>That’s Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You guys relax, I’ll get it. Have some bread while it’s still warm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I’d be Bruce Wayne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You have a Batsuit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s pajamas, there’s no cape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, I’m living here again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Anyway, come on in, dinner’s ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is the Wi-Fi working for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I’ve got you, so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If it’s like your 3-D chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, I tried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a good thing you’re cute.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, I know a CPR instructor who’ll come to the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’d be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’ll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you again for cooking. It’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You just kick back and relax, I’ve got it all under control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Although it was already under control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m sorry, you mumbled something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, you know what they say, it takes a village.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, they already had a village.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I noticed the village couldn’t find time to put the crib together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We’ll pass, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do something, Batman.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you think you’re doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Separating my delicates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is the level you’re stooping to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m here to put the crib together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Ooh, sorry, I already did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well I don’t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why are you being like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Why can’t there be four wheels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is this what you do when I’m not here, make really good points?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>If you’re hungry you can eat your take-out, nobody touched it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Strange old man</speaker><content>Hey, how you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Strange old man</speaker><content>I don’t think so, but you’re sweet for asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, what are you doing in our apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Strange old man</speaker><content>Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Theodore</speaker><content>It’s like the ’40s again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Anyway, I’ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Theodore</speaker><content>Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I’m O-negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And now you know as much about him as I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great, go with the giraffes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Good choice, boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>At least my nose is naturally brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, could you please go to the market for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Get Stuart or Raj to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Please just go to the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Raj (off)</speaker><content>Me</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Stuart (off)</speaker><content>I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And just leave him here alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Theodore</speaker><content>Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Theodore</speaker><content>I like the painting. Is that your mom?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because you were being selfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dividing our belongings is difficult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why? I said I didn’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Theodore</speaker><content>Excuse me. It’s none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Theodore</speaker><content>Well, I’m just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you’re in a new phase of your lives and it’s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think he might be right. Also, who is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Theodore</speaker><content>If you’re looking for a new guy to live with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re good, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, no one’s gonna tell me? Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’d like that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You promise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Theodore</speaker><content>Well if we’re rubbing genitals on things, that’s where I shine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, still hideous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.</content></utterance>
