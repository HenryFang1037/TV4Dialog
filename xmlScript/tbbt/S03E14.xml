<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whatcha doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then I’ve been up all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you’re stuck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is he doing now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aye, aye, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe you need a fresh start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right.  It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How long has he been stuck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Have you tried rebooting him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I think it’s a firmware problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj (arriving)</speaker><content>Hey, it’s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who’s up for getting down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What could be better? We’re in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can come with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Structure, constant structure. One atom…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought I smelled popcorn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Raj (as Sheldon reaches out and grabs from his plate)</speaker><content>Hey, those are my lima beans!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not lima beans, carbon atoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But if I don’t eat my lima beans, I can’t have my cookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here, you want my peas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Want my corn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good. P.F. Chang’s? My mom has coupons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not this time, I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The plural of coccyx is coccyges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You had some nice moves out there, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks. You, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not really. I was in my boogie zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>When Howard tried to do the splits…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, poor baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God! Are you… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do I look okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t bark at me. I fell, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>With marbles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, that’s a crazy thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough REM sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Which leads to…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Impaired cognitive function.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I don’t want to go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m going to count to three. One…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was amazing how you handled him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it creeps me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just answer the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Have fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Security Guard</speaker><content>Ball pit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks for not calling the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Security Guard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, it’s no big deal. My sister’s got a kid who’s special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I’m still working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can try, but you’ll never catch me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon (popping his head up)</speaker><content>Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard (Waking up as Penny screams)</speaker><content>What! What, what, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your cell phone was off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And that didn’t work out, did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? You figured out the graphene problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny (as Sheldon sits on the bed)</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Einstein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m going to need a little more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Albert Einstein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Keep going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds like a great plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard doesn’t snore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Told you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Employment Office Assistant</speaker><content>So, Mr. Cooper, you’re looking for a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A menial job. Like yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Why, thank you for noticing. I’m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shouldn’t you check your database?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Assistant (clicks her keyboard a few times)</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You didn’t really type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>I didn’t really have to. So, how about construction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I could do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s sheetrock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That seems acceptable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Do you have your own car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>Of course you don’t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Assistant</speaker><content>I see. Just give me a second. Security!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll get those drinks started for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray)</speaker><content>Behind you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thanks, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress, not a busboy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Double guacamole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No cilantro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Lettuce shredded, not chopped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You understand why I’m doing this to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’ll be all. That was fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How long can he keep this up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He never went back to the university?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But he’s afraid of dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon took our order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon doesn’t work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Sheldon (drops tray. A nearby table claps)</speaker><content>Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean this up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I don’t work here.</content></utterance>
