<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, ready for lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, one sec.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’ll teach her to care about your health.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When was the last actual exercise you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Had me at flag, lost me at football.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s indoors, so no sunscreen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No throwing, no catching, no running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No gym shorts that can be yanked down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or worse, up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Preach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, touché.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Thanks for coming by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sure. So how can we help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can’t get ’em in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, what have you tried so far?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, I’ve, I’ve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? In a comic book store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry. I, I’ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren’t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, you don’t know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We can still be swashers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well said, Puss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn’t a joke. I hope you’re not here because you think it’s going to be wike Star Wars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not why we’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And maybe a little Princess Bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you’re not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re not afraid of physical activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Awwight. Let’s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>What’s wong, Cooper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right. Always right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s a righty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, Barry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When can I stab one of my friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>In fencing, we don’t call it a stab. We call it a touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee.  Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I’m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Have you thought about advertising directly to females?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don’t be afraid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Eh, the Internet’s so negative. I try to avoid it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>See? Negative.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought you were Puss in Boots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When was your honour insulted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My last physical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, this is fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>What’s going on with Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Weawwy? Good to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s unacceptable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course. She deserves to be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How dare you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Barry, a word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And now the crazy version of what I just said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>And how are you gonna do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>By challenging you to a duel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>You’ve had one wesson. I’ll destwoy you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>All right, I’m not saying it’s true, but let’s, let’s consider for a moment that possibly I’m the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You can say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, that’s ’cause I’m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>It was a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, I’m still doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn’t run away or kill itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That really happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I mean, I can’t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I’m alone, the more desperate I get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, we’re all feeling it. Yes, I’ll go out with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How many sips of that beer did he have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a Pokémon reference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I don’t know what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Older woman</speaker><content>I’m married, and I’m her grandmother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Stuart took that rejection like a pro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And sometimes we marry them anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy (Phone text sound)</speaker><content>Huh. Well, this is weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Barry Kripke just asked me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, what are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What can it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You mean, not a scientist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think she means not a weirdo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you attracted to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t have to imagine it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I smell funny. I taste salty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re just sweaty from exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We should let you guys talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t have to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look at me go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How’d that go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, actually, he, he already did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I said no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I didn’t know you were interested in dating.</content></utterance>
