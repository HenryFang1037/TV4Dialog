<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re sorry, Rajesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe we can do it next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hallelujah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Because I’ve got something even better planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We did them at Princeton, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And Princeton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, uh, who’s in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think it sounds fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Various</speaker><content>I’m in, let’s do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt?  Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I’ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p…  each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He is a born showman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Any questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ha-ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, see? Now he gets it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Should we just do couples?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just said, couples sound great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Stop that. Penny is not a liability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Maybe we pick names out of a hat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj (over walkie-talkie)</speaker><content>All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, you’re really good at puzzles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stop yelling at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But we haven’t finished the puzzle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it’s not gonna say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s the comic book store. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s the comic book store.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you think Penny’s mad at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, because I didn’t want her on my team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Huh, I guess you’re right. Wonder why that is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Such as?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Tell me some things you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, how about some music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Find something you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I love Neil Diamond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Both</speaker><content>Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I’ve been inclined…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn’t invited to be a part of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I have asthma. Back off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good riddle, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I invited you to my murder mystery party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is a marathon, not a sprint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>People run in a marathon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not with a bowling ball on their back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Relax, it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Riddle me this…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, you know what this could mean .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>To the Neil Mobile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I knew it, we’re gonna lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, I got it. I got it/</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Congratulations, you got it last.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re really mean, you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>So no one’s gonna buy anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shut up. I solved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>On the boats and on the planes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They’re coming to America.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. He can fix things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Like death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette (out of the window)</speaker><content>Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s not answering my texts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who cares? Focus on the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What does she think I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I can’t believe she would say that about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Maybe the spot’s the clue.</content></utterance>
