<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>All</speaker><content>MONTE.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>As with my father, I both love and fear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, enough chitchat, let’s destroy something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Together (lifting)</speaker><content>One, two, three, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe we should start small.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the Magic Eight Ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did it when I was four. It’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about the toaster oven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What did the toaster oven ever do to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gentlemen, goggles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How about “Die, toaster, die”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Raj (after watching complete destruction of toaster oven)</speaker><content>All right, what’s next?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I think I’m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh-huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Killer robot. We built it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it almost killed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, who exactly does it want to kill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a big deal. There’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you’d like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How is it supposed to be a dance if I’m the only girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You’d be the only doable girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re a pig, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How is doable anything but a compliment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Our tango?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m begging you, stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you’re a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you’re the one who’s peculiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Um, so what are you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wait a minute. This isn’t flirting, you’re serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Flirting? You think I’m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks for the heads up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, where you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, someone had to say it.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Howard, the phone is ringing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here’s a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Hello? All right, hold on. It’s your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you’re not at school today!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t go to school, Ma. I work at a university.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>That’s a school! Now pick up the phone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk to anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t have homework. I’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants. Want me to get you a Popsicle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Cherry, please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>I ate the cherry. All that’s left is green.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You make me want to kill myself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, now they’re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Kripke (arriving)</speaker><content>Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, we did, Kripke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>His name is Monte.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Well, if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Wobot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, is that really necessary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I’m given to understand that your mother is overweight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, snap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What difference does it make? Fat is fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There are boundaries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let’s settle this woboto a woboto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>There’s no guawantee we’ve gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let’s thwow down. You know, unless you’re afwaid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Tomowow, thwee o’clock, the kinetics wab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Make it so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, don’t make it so. Barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>What’s wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>We’re all pathetic and cweepy and can’t get girls, that’s why we fight wobots. If you’re not there, you’ll be exposed to widicule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m curious, what part of America is that accent from?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, come on in. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I need you to apologize to How…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on. Wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, then have the robot go and get him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>His feelings needed to be hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s been in bed for two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? The guy is devastated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I turn into a bear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And say what? That I didn’t mean it, because I meant it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, pthththth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, come on, that’s not fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I came home with no pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll go over there tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What about her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s a delightful woman. You’ll love her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Howard, there’s a blonde girl, Patsy, here to see you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Okay, now she’s saying it’s Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, I just came by to see how you were doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good. Your mom seems nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I’ve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I’m sorry. Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, you’re sorry. Good-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, you’re okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I’m a big boy. I’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Well, bye.  So close </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God. That’s Kripke’s robot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Kripke (voice)</speaker><content>As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t watch anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, we have to call it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We don’t have that option, we’ve accepted the challenge. We can’t run away from a fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify Monte so that he’s prepared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have faith, gentlemen. We don’t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn’t have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, that sounds sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it’s cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess you’d say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin’ ’bout Marcy…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Grossman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look at me. What chance do I have if I don’t try too hard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you’d have a terrific chance. I mean, you’re smart, you’re funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I’m telling you, I’ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I’m talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he’s a nice guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I do. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nice little bot you’ve got here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>I’m aware.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s this do, spin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we’ve got to call this off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But, Sheldon, we don’t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s not overconfidence, that’s observation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>What is his pwoblem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Never. I’d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, you got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  That’s new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Run, Monte, run!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Go, Monte! Go Monte!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go, go, go, go!</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No one’s arguing with you, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard (arriving)</speaker><content>I got your text. How bad is… Oy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Forget the robot. What happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He slipped and fell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don’t treat them with respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So what do you think, Howard? It’s not that bad, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. Monte’s gone. We’ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I’ll speak. Leonard, you’ll play your cello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, honey, aren’t you getting a little carried away? I mean, it’s just a toy robot.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know, I got it. Sheldon, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, don’t get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I’m halfway to pity sex.</content></utterance>
