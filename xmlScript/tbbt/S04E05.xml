<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So what’s going on with you two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right, right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sense judgment on your part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no. Maybe a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, right. That.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Probably. What’s your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm, recently? Not much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That sounds lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.  We’d never put Meemaw in a home!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard (phone rings)</speaker><content>Excuse me. That’s my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Rai</speaker><content>You mean, you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Two words, deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk, because she can’t hear me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s what she said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>…who’s a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Well, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Not really. She’s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just break up with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, no, I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>‘Cause then I’d be alone, like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you going to let me tell the story or not?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard? Are you sleeping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you ill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy (on webcam)</speaker><content>May I offer an observation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell? How long has she been here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Since we got home from the comic bookstore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was two hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you know that, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard (exiting the apartment)</speaker><content>Keep going. I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That was rude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s make that our word of the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Agreed. And we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wait. I have a request.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’d like you to meet my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. Can I get back to you on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Certainly. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good night.  Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can’t say that anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-52"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-53"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait! What am I supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-54"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-55"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m a physicist, not a hippie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-56"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Screwed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy’s right. He is tedious.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard, get the door!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>Why can’t you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>You know I’m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I’m like an upside-down volcano here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, hey. I hope you didn’t hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The volcano thing? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s just something I threw on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know all your shirts. That’s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how’d it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just FYI, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You that desperate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I know what you mean.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, you’re going off the grid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What if she just comes over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You changed the address on the building? What about mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard (there is a knock on the door)</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Amy (off)</speaker><content>Amy Farrah Fowler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Darn! She found me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s been here before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tell her I’m not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Way to go on the details.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Girl (arriving)</speaker><content>Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joy</speaker><content>Hi. You don’t look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joy</speaker><content>Aah! Time’s up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I’m hilarious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joy</speaker><content>Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy’s nuts off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joy</speaker><content>Number 42!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Rats!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request actually means, and I don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that I’m in a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Precisely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy Farrah Fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My apologies. Good night, Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good night, Sheldon.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she’ll grow on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not that I’ve ever seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Joy</speaker><content>Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Joy</speaker><content>Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin’s wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re asking me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Joy</speaker><content>Yeah. And it’s an open bar, so I’ll probably be giving it away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I look forward to it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Mrs Fowler (on webcam)</speaker><content>It’s nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn’t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Mrs Fowler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Mrs Fowler</speaker><content>Amy, what is he saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Mrs Fowler</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.</content></utterance>
