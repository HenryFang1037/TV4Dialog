<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is the best number? By the way, there’s only one correct answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh-uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I get it now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did you know that the iconic Valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey, Penny, how’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>My dad’s company prints the menus for this place. I’m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes ’em easier to clean if people throw up on ’em. Guess how I got the idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Okay, well, it was good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s really cute. How do you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, we went out a couple of times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no. But in this case, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it was great. He just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wouldn’t help. Zack can’t even spell NPR.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette’s syndrome.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did he get superpowers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. Well, that’s disappointing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, but who’d want to become Rat-Man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mouse Boy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn’t be the sidekick. You’d be the sidekick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, Leonard, who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I’m checking my vital signs every hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. What were the symptoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Localized to what region?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ears and genitalia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny’s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then why did you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ask what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why do you keep saying Zack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because you keep saying who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And the answer was Zack, correct?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There was no question. I simply said hoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What the heck is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Perhaps. Are you scared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. But it’s a stupid test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on. That’s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right, I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How did you get so brave all of a sudden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny’s friend Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Let’s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Religion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t. It’s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cheap science fiction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I’ve considered it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I reject it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. Isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s thinking ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So how’s Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just going to skip over that insult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What insult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what’s the</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Forget science. She’s horny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh! Okay. Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you suggesting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy’s urges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s illegal to spay a human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin.</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You got a better idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Every idea is better than this idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait. What the hell is ding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a bell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. How do you want to start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One-two-three-go? That’s for babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re starting now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t yell at me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sure it’ll wash off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There’s Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure this is what you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not what I want to do, it’s what I have to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>My gluteus what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.</content></utterance>
