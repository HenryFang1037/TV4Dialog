<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They are, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s called a fashion choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good boy. Here’s a cookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, fellas, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, mummies and zombies again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, they’re not the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You get a cookie, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, 294?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s my parking spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. That’s my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I’m sure they’ll give you another parking space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you listening to yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. You leave me no choice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon (on phone)</speaker><content>President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. I… Yes, I’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that’s some salty language. May I remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I’m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever take my side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I can never understand your side.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Give it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d love to help you out, but unfortunately , I’m using it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. I’m taking your diploma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We’re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. So, how you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I feel like I’m five pounds lighter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really? Only five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, anybody want a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound to lock horns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I mean, Howard’s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re right. And I’m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If and when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t have to take this. I’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn’t mean it that way,</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, here’s another one: If a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t have any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not giving it away. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get off there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Give me back my Iron Man helmet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Give me back my parking space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is so exciting. I’m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Freaking pigs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wait, I’m leaving my car here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, colour me intrigued.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a lot of Band-Aids.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake.  Oh, I’ll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, looks like someone’s on Team Bernadette. Where’s Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s not here. What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, no. Where was it parked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>In Sheldon’s spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That doesn’t make sense. Sheldon doesn’t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard’s spot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, that doesn’t make sense, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Because I’m the one who had it towed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Didn’t see that one coming, did ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not gonna see this coming. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ow! Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my God,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you okay?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I’ve been meaning to take to the bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t move. I’ll get some ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what’s left of your pubes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks. Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Gee, you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You hit her! What did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You had my car towed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You were parked in Howard’s spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I was parked in Sheldon’s spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sheldon doesn’t have a spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The tow truck didn’t scratch your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>‘Cause I did it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Morning, Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that whiteboard. That’s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. You said I’m not using my space, so I’m using it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, you need to move now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can’t stay there forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Those aren’t gonna help you, Sheldon,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m warning you, Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  Stop that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Get out of my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. That’s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you idiots doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not just a parking spot. He can’t handle the fact that I’m a bigger deal than he is now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can you believe this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What I don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. Don’t hate me just because I lived the dream. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, sweet ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you doing in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just breaking in your new car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stop that. You stop that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course, come in.  This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard, that’s not how we practiced it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I’ll park in the structure across the street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Howard, thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There is nothing to say. Except I’m the bigger man. I’m not kidding. Say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Just say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re the bigger man, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To burying the hatchet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You know, I’m kind of glad this happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny (with two black eyes and a plaster across her nose)</speaker><content>Yeah, everybody’s happy, great.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem.
