<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A little jealous, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I’m not jealous. All right, I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now, can we order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So what? It’s the same food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, General Tso.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s obviously a typo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It doesn’t mean any of that! It’s a typo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? Let’s just get a pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure, no mobsters there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And why is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was listed under seafood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard (noticing their door has been broken open)</speaker><content>What the…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The TV is gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So are our laptops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We like games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Assorted video games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When does the CSI team get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In anticipation of their arrival, I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>I’d be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>We’re done here. Call this number, and we’ll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Do you have any more information that might be relevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How is that going to help them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Policeman</speaker><content>Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are we supposed to do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, how I wish I could.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe it. If I hadn’t been working the dinner shift, I would’ve run</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not scared. I would’ve gone all Nebraska on their asses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hand me the bat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It won’t happen again, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re fine, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, then. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good night. That was weird, even for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see you’re drinking wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But you don’t like other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do tonight. It’s scary over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s getting scary here, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um… three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don’t know. Star Wars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did we win? Can we go to bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s right, Penny. It’s all there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, wait, what’s 0400?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>4am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s, like, in 45 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just keep walking. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Woman on TV</speaker><content>It’s quiet out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Man on TV</speaker><content>Maybe a little too quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Woman on TV</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Man on TV</speaker><content>Just gonna take a look around outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Woman on TV</speaker><content>No, Jim, don’t open the door!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Listen to her, Jim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Man on TV</speaker><content>Don’t worry, there’s no one out here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard and Penny!  Leonard and Penny!  Leonard and Penny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if they cut the power?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if someone steals my keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll send them a basket of muffins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now, inside, we’ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where did you get all this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He just gave it to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn’t all that good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Raj, your car is blocking me…  What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, let me help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, the net’s going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo.  Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I heard a noise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was us. We knocked over a lamp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you knock over a lamp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We were going to have…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He doesn’t need to know what we were doing, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh! No, she’s right, I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing? Use the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great, you do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m lactose intolerant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, what can you do? Here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, you can’t move. Don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is he quitting his job at the university?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Born and raised. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sense you’re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That’s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They call themselves Bozites?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon on laptop screen</speaker><content>Greetings. As you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, that’s so… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon (entering again)</speaker><content>You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn’t Bozeman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>How the hell do I know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Help you with your bags, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce.  Wait! Wait! Excuse me!  One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, look who’s back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.</content></utterance>
