<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t want credit for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re in a good mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What brought this on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I made French toast sticks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On oatmeal day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah, I also made oatmeal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You sure you’re up for that? She did hurt you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You’re crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But what are you looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Isn’t that a little unreasonable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, Amy, show us the dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you have any heels higher than this? He’s pretty tall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, come on, tell us more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Did you kiss him yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just a little peck on the lips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine. Um, he’s British. All right, that is a juicy one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Tea and basketball?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>To that new Italian place on Walnut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m gonna go look for other shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ll just call the restaurant, pretend I’m Amy and check the reservation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Damn, you’re sneaky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you don’t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You seriously think women would fight for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He’s right, he knows a lot of jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me, too. And we’ve seen the prize.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? I don’t want to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re not curious who she’s out with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Golly, she sounds too good to be true.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Tall British Dave</speaker><content>This is fun. I haven’t dated much since my divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>No, it’s, it’s fine. It’s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. So, where are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Across the street, in the left window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You just happen to have those in the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>By stalking them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. Stalkers are creepy. I’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, there he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s cute, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Can I see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, I should’ve brought my parabolic microphone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Nothing. Not important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>So you’ve never been married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been in one long-term relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Oh. What happened with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Oh, that’s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What’s his focus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Wait, you’re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m trying not to. Do you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>No, but I’ve followed his work for years. He’s a rock star. You’ve got to tell me about him. What’s he like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He really seems into her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why’d you bring him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I had to; we’re married now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ugh, I hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>I’m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>It’s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Um about an hour and half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he’s a genius, and I wasn’t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-49"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What was the rest of your question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-50"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Do you think you could introduce me to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-51"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-52"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>You’re right, it’s, it’s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I’d be too nervous. Oh, I don’t know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-54"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Right here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>37 minutes left until the deadline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Someone will show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Someone will show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I have a DVD of that lecture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Really? Wasn’t it great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not as a Valentine’s present, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Well, the next time you watch it, I’m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s, um, terrific. Listen, I’m, I’m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Oh, gosh. Sorry, I’ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I’m such an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, you’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won’t mention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>That you said you might introduce me to, I’m free on Thursday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hey, hey, they’re leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they’re coming right towards us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We got to get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>She just hit my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you guys doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>O-M-G. Aren’t you Leonard Hofstadter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It’s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. Pinch me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Amy, I’m never washing this hand again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You really should.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One minute is a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ve been telling women that for 20 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Forty-five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thirty seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You thought she was great in X-Men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, fine, I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Guys, fifteen seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe we did make the test too difficult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Answer it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I’ve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Careful, it’s addictive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Vanessa</speaker><content>Chija”e’vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Vanessa</speaker><content>Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don’t need to tell you, there aren’t a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How could you send her away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Uh, thanks for driving me home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No problem. I’m really sorry about your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Oh, it’s all right. If you’re free next weekend, I’d love to take you out again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t think this is working out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>Oh. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m, I’m really sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>No, it’s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>If I ever do meet him, we’ll have that in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure. Heh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Dave</speaker><content>And, he’s kissed you and I’ve kissed you, so if you think about it…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, get out.</content></utterance>
