<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I could keep my Gmail account, I’d be okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>– Hewwo, fewwas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman’s office was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish, I’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Show a little compassion, a man died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pchew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>If you need my nose, you’ll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You Ph.D’s gonna go suck up like Kripke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. I mean, I’ll apply, but I’m not gonna stoop to playing politics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can’t get tenure, I’d like to see you or Sheldon get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj, don’t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me, but I think I’m just as qualified as you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So tenured means a job for life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. You know, I’m like the sun. Can’t turn this off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Money from family does come with strings attached.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think that’s enough wine for now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She’d be proud, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or, the chainsaw.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant’s back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m gonna make some coffee.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not gonna schmooze anybody. I’m gonna let my work speak for itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you. I’m a naive idiot, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, good, you heard me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You don’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. Let’s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Is that a problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Even you. You’re a slave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>I’m a what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not sure, it could go either way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Dr. Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Just thought I’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I’m not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>You push start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right. This one might be broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>You have to move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I’m feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Yep. I got to get a home gym.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I’ll be throwing my hat in the ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>All right, I’ll keep an eye out for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in… ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Janine the Machine, wet’s do this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Hey, Barry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>No, my pweasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I’ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I’ll e-mail it to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Aw wight, I’m warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s enough cardio for me. I’m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Call someone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not really in space. Anyhoo, I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Oh, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Shelldon (off)</speaker><content> Mrs Davis?  Mrs Davis?  Mrs Davis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>God, they’re everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, hello. I’m fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Uh, Dr. Cooper, that’s not necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s too late. Get ready to like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Roots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um… Well… You are black, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>This meeting has come to an end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let’s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Where have you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nurse’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Asthma attack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I’m fine, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You guys going to Professor Tupperman’s memorial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Probably not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Barely knew him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that’s what I was hoping for, meerkats.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I won’t be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>First of all, when you say things like that, people think you’re crazy. Second, the reason I’m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It sounds like a long and tedious evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I’d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee’s going to be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course it would. I’m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do anything interesting today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we weren’t going to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, what a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, since Amy’s going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I’m not sure how much help you’d be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, then you all can get tenure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I’ve got to get tenure. Okay, let’s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we’re both going to be living like animals.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Glad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bad. However…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me. I’m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren’t coming here, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’d like to know why Penny’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m here to support my man, just like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you going to do? Take people’s drink orders and get them wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? Did she do it yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard’s cause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. Don’t just stand there. Take your breasts out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, meerkat fight!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Way to hit ’em with both barrels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, because that was not clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? That was ambiguous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You could talk some smack about his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj’s mother for a dollar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you do what you want, but I don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So is tenure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-41"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-43"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-44"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about it, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you think I should do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-46"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, you’ll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want any more, but let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-48"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-49"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>I could not ask you to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-50"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. We cannot lose to that jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-52"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, screw it. I’m going in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-53"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I’m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don’t worry, I didn’t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-54"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.</content></utterance>
