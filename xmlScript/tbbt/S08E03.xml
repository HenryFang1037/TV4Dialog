<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You suck, Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I’m sure you do suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Baseball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s practicing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What, you? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, not just him. May I remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>C’mon now, throw one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You look like a jackass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Cut it out. You’re hurting my feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now you know why we’re not outside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you enjoy my lecture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, and neither did our waiter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, how was dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good, I had Cornish game hen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, that poor waiter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You guys are going out two nights in a row?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s so hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s better than hot, it’s binding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you join us on a double date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I can’t believe you’re sore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn’t say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you, that would be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great. And while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s wrong with the way I run?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I then suggested a pub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ignore them, Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t honestly think that, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s the part you have a problem with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There they go, fighting again. You’d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad’s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>All right, the pitcher’s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Keep going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’ll let you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are you kidding me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s sixty feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s no way this is sixty feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m looking at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For starters, we enjoy spending time together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s called parallel play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, toddlers do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not as well as we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So what? Why do you even care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s a good thing I’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, it’s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Just throw the ball. Let’s see what we’re working with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on Howard, fire it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Throw the damn ball!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So when do you guys plan on getting married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I have one of your fries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Absolutely not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How ridiculous is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I’m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown wig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, what did those rascals do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, this is accurate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Kind of? It does it perfectly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. We’ll take it right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just don’t take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on. It’ll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot of work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Think he’s getting any better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That was a close one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is it too late for him to cancel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Heads up! Watch out!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you mad at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, stop being stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you worried about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, that scares me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Mike (on Skype)</speaker><content>Hey, Froot Loops, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah. Don’t do it. What else you up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why shouldn’t I do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>There’s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you’re an idiot on YouTube forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids that’ll be there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>That’s what I’m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, maybe I’ll do a good job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I don’t know. In space, you couldn’t even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, thanks for the pep talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She’s so much cuter than you, I don’t know how you ever got her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s so nice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I killed his Chewbacca slippers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Let’s just take the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, I don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or a one. A one is possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Marriage is scary. You’re scared, I’m scared. But it doesn’t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It would make me so happy if you said things like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you’re happy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look at you, talking sports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, what did you expect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s the bobblehead of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Does it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, as long as it bobbles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, I am so proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks. I’m proud of me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>You ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Wish me luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Go get ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Stadium Announcer</speaker><content>Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can he really throw a ball?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>On our Quidditch team, he…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s a no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover.
