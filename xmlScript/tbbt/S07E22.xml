<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Don’t be ridiculous. That’s Wookiee Life Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, when is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, well, it’s not May the fifth, and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>May the fourth be with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>May the force be with you. Get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, you got a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Actually, I’m glad you’re here. I’m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I’m worried an hour won’t be enough time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’ve got some bad news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Professor Proton is dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Comforting you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Anyway, the, the funeral’s on Sunday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But, that’s Star Wars Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Professor Proton (on youtube)</speaker><content>This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can’t digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn’t that a hoot? We’ll be right back after I fire my writers.  Oh, shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Watching your old friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m not going to the funeral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, no, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I wonder why that is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I have a confession to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ve never been to a funeral before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I feel like I want to cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t do it with you staring at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am not a crybaby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Toy Story 3?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I got your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ugh, let’s get this over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was just a suggestion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Should we try to console him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>By staying here and watching the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s what good friends would do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe we should see how he’s doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But after the cantina scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Obviously.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>You never heard it that time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Arthur. I thought you were dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I am. Oh, it, it’s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I’ve gone without running into a men’s room in, in, in years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I don’t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I’m, I’m not, I’m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, that, that clears that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You must be here to give me advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Those are your Jedi robes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Be careful with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I’m, uh, I’m going to need a Band-Aid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, what did you think of your first funeral?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You think about dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What would you regret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know Klingon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I meant that as a regret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just thought of one more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it just wasn’t the right time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know that face. That’s your propose face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s two to one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my. It’s not a contest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I think I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Girl Sprouts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How did that get you into science?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>On the one hand, if I say yes…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Where, where, where are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Um, always, get, get a prenup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, why, why do you think I’m here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Is, is this the, the first time you’ve lost, you know, someone close to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve, I’ve outlived a few of my doctors, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>I’m, I’m sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, you know, it’s, it’s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I do appreciate them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Arthur</speaker><content>Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m okay. How was the funeral?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…?  Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>At least they toned him down in the second one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, he is pretty stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, we can say it. You can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
