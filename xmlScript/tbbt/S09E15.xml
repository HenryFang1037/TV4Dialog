<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not a clue. Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t sound very excited about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You mean the strong, sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don’t you just do it already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, just get it over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, you really gonna break up with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I stopped counting at four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She meant Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I, I really didn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You’re seriously breaking up with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>And you thought right before Valentine’s Day was a good time to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re right, let’s talk again in a few days.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj (on phone)</speaker><content>Hey, Claire. Hi. It’s, it’s Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you’re free for Valentine’s Day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But I just broke up with my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Claire</speaker><content>Right before Valentine’s Day? What an ass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you were right, tears.</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they’re around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and speaking of Valentine’s Day, I haven’t forgotten about you tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. That is so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Catchy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m gonna check the temp on the tub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t make it too hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look at that, you shaved it all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Ew, really? Get it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh, wish we had a skimmer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know how to turn off the jets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good, I don’t know where we keep the strainer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So what did you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Maitre d’</speaker><content>I’m afraid so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Maitre d’</speaker><content>Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I took care of it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we’re live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun With Flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Consider tonight’s episode a Valentine’s Day gift for you, our viewers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Raj (voice)</speaker><content>What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Rajesh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I, I think it starts with good communication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I hope you don’t think I’m just saying this because it’s Valentine’s Day, but, I love you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, how do we do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it’s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I’m gonna say check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you gonna say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m still sleeping with you tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See if you can get a table by the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi there. What’s your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Maitre d’</speaker><content>Glen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Maitre d’</speaker><content>Well, you know, Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Maitre d’</speaker><content>With all due respect, ma’am, there’s nothing I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You don’t have to call me ma’am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Maitre d’</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I mean, we’re basically the same age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Maitre d’</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How old are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Maitre d’</speaker><content>I’m 21. How old are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because I’m young. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Raj (voice)</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Your friend is hurting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Barry (voice)</speaker><content>Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Kripke? Is that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I’w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t see why not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s eating. That’s a good sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s pretty cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He is. Should we name him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you’re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Poor judgement, obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s so little. I’m sure it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It is freaking amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, glad you’re feeling better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is that a big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, they’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Won’t make us any younger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And actually, it was three different men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>No, actuawwy, I’m stiw here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don’t know if I can do that again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>…spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Hey, I think I got cut off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello, Kripke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you actually gonna dance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That sounds fun. When’s it start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, terrific.</content></utterance>
