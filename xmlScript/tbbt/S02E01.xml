<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s very interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s also not pink and has no berries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What was your question again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Do you want some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, gas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, good night. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There was a draft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t feel a draft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why don’t we just go into your….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s only our first date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Or we could just wing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That might work too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Goodnight Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Goodnight. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s coming. Screen saver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about, the date went fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You being the fish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not the fish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh really, did you make a second date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we sort of decided to wing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, even I know that’s lame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t say anything like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good, ‘cos they don’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nice close up, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not a bad sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Give him time.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once)</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, may I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How is that not a braniac?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That depends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>On what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you speak Klingon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you know any card tricks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you lie about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but you were neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re asking me to keep a secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Physiologically impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You could be Batman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sure.  I’m Batman. See.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Hi guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon (looking the other way uncomfortably)</speaker><content>Hi Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about Saturday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard (chasing him)</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s wrong with your face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said Good Day! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good day?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon (appearing behind her)</speaker><content>You must release me from my oath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why don’t you take a minute to decide  I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon (entering)</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m moving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There doesn’t have to be a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, there kind of does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m still confused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, qu’est q’wass up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And some of those skinless chicks were hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you take a band aid off in front of him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you make fun of trains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, we all knew this day was coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where are you gonna live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bye </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I hate trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This could work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is a very old building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not until now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television)</speaker><content>Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>Strippergram. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Tag. You’re it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you want to switch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Get out of bed, we’re switching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, only if you want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just get in the bed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard’s mother (off)</speaker><content>What’s going on? Are you boys roughhousing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re just talking ma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard’s mother</speaker><content>If you don’t settle down right now, I’m not going to let you have any more sleepovers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>For God’s sake, ma, I’m 27 years old. It’s not even a school night!  Comfy now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So don’t look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No kidding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What about Lee Meriwether?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well I’m glad that’s settled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. But he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m ba-ack!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I still don’t know why you left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I promised Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You promised Penny what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What secret. Tell me the secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not that secret, the other secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m Batman. Shhhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I drank milk that tasted funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny (opening door)</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He told you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pasadena city college?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That doesn’t matter to me at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Absolutely.  Okay, this time I know where I went wrong.  Oh bite me!</content></utterance>
