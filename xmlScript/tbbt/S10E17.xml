<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How bad is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re helping Raj figure out his finances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought your dad paid your cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s a penguin I sponsor. They’re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is Pink Cheeks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like a business manager?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, absolutely not. You can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What if there’s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He sounds like a sociopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We don’t know, his mother never had him tested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, wait, who’s gonna break it to the penguin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I’m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can’t buy one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re actually going to Comic-Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year I’d tag along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, that’s sweet. I bet you’ll have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, do you want to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Please? I went to your boring thing last month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>My aunt’s funeral?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I’m not going, but I do think it’s nice you want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not that I want to go, I just think it’ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon’s job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And hate all the crowds at the panels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She’s gonna hate the panels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t you just tell her not to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, she’s so excited, I can’t do that to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What if you make it sound so bad she won’t want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That I would do to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t believe Penny’s gonna get to go, and I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Panels. Just wanted to be included.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See? Miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, you’re right, I got myself into this, but I’ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your father may have spoiled you, but I won’t. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re a grown man who’s highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Go ahead, make jokes. I don’t know why you think you’re going to Comic-Con, you just had a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, so? So you think Bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can’t afford it, Howard’s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m gonna go as Dumbledore.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mm-mm, how’s my favourite girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Making lasagna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, she’s sexy, she can cook. I’m such a lucky guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, dear God, you’re cheating on me with Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ha ha ha, never gets old. Okay, there is something I want, but it’s not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I’ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. I’m even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s so hard to say no to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So I’ll say maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You said tickets don’t go on sale till Friday, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>See where I’m going with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>If you don’t know how to make lasagna, Google does.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It’s where all the vendors and exhibits are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where’s Wolowitz? Okay, now, This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here’s the hotel room we all share.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, you and I would get our own room, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon’s feet and my head? That’s where you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. It’s like an all-night party. There’s trivia contests and Dungeons _ Dragons. As we like to say, it’s off the chain mail.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I know. And I did it with a straight face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Well, all right. I’ll give you 25 bucks. That’s my best offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I have no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You know, if you want to make extra money, I could throw some work your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really? I’ll do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Great, you’re hired. First thing you can do is put price tags on these. Start the little ones at fifty.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, it’s no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Comic-Con’s five days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t, it’ll break his heart. You know, he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy, like going outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He is an indoor cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, maybe it won’t be that bad. Leonard says it’s really mainstream now. Comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>Howie, can you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>Kind of busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette (off)</speaker><content>Busy like I’ll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s with the gloves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They complete my ensemble. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I tried.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, of course, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is just something you usually do together, and if I’m screwing it up, I don’t have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, why? Do you not want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why? Do you not want me to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I want you to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, good, ’cause that’s what I want, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now we’re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don’t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don’t want that either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is that nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, but it’s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, it’s more complicated than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there’s hair growing out of it, that’s a mole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you think she’s as honest with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, I’d like to think she meant it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, you’d think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Here, let me help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, Double Stuffed Oreos, I remember when I could afford you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>There she goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Stay, I’ll get her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I appreciate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s fine. She and I can cry together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s such a sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know, I wish there was some way we could help him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s working out great for me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny says they’re ready to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, women can wear make up, it’s not lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, what’s Leonard lying about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He doesn’t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He’s just doing it to make her happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Really? Because she doesn’t actually want to go. She’s just doing it to make him happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So they’re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That’s hilarious. I can’t wait to tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No, you’re not gonna tell them anything. You’re gonna stay out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because it’s between them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, if you haven’t noticed, I’ve been between them for the last ten years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, babe, you want to drive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, or you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s fine, I know you don’t like the way I drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t have a problem with your driving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Shh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He wasn’t in a car, but okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just say you want to drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I honestly don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, do us a favour, please drive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure, happy to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If you want to drive, just drive. I don’t see why this has to be so complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not complicated. Amy’s driving, that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not it because you’re clearly upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re the one who seems upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would I be upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Because you don’t want her to go to Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is an interesting way to stay out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wait, you don’t want me to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, that’s why she doesn’t want to go. You set ’em up, I knock ’em down, good job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just thought it would make you happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don’t want to go and I don’t need to bring you, is everything good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hold on, I’m trying to decide if I’m mad at you. No, I’m happy I don’t have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-42"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, problem solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-43"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not entirely, the fight over who’s going to drive is still…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-45"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, my God, stop talking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Kinda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Dinner’s almost ready. If you like meatloaf, I’m sure you’ll like its cousin, bowl of meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, if you’re still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you, but it doesn’t look like I’m going to Comic-Con this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure. This is for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you’ve done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Um, I also take care of Halley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And you live here for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I do, ma’am, thank you, ma’am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is so generous of you, I, um, I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now you can come with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, there’s room in the bed by Sheldon’s feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>As much as I appreciate this, I can’t accept it, okay? Halley’s my goddaughter, I don’t take care of her for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Keep it. Consider it a gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. I’m not keeping this. I’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won’t help that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So you’re not going to Comic-Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ve been plenty of times. If I miss one, it’s fine. I’m a big boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m a big boy, and if I missed one, I’d throw a big-boy tantrum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? I’ve gone 12 times. Maybe I’ll sit out this year, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, how about white-water rafting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what, I’m not gonna go either. I’m a father now. I’d rather spend time with my family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You just don’t want to go alone with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m gonna go check on dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sounds like everyone’s staying home. What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nuts to that, I’m going to Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>By yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-40"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’ll go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s my pretty girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not going with you to Comic-Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? Can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He can, but it’s still not changing my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. It’s a list of this year’s panelists. It’s long, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
