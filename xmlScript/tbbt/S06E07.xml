<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started, I’d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I can’t. The only entry was from GameyGamer75, and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help me, I’m pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend, Wil Wheaton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m happy to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Wooden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t worry, it wasn’t terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My friend, Wil Wheaton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, Wil, what do you have for us first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what’s interesting about this flag…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>What was wrong with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s called Fun with Flags. They’re not at half-mast, nobody died. Let’s try and keep it upbeat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Um, no offence, but I’ve been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>So do I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Great. So, this time let’s try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>And cut. You realize that I’m doing this for free, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes. And so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. Let’s try it again. Everybody’s having fun. And action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, Wil, what do you have for us first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Problem, first-time director?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He was overacting on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Listen, Sheldon, I’m really happy to do this for you, but not if she’s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You gonna let him speak to me like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you’re my girlfriend and I don’t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton’s my friend and I don’t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket.  What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can I speak to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine. Then maybe I should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I’ll see you at dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>50 cents sounds right. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, it’s kinda late. Why don’t we just spend the night here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Because we don’t live here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard, I’m doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There’s some underwear in the hamper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you’re getting at. How about this weekend I’ll box up all my things and move them to our place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Or in the closet. We can decide later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Howard, help, my hand’s stuck in the garbage disposal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>Are you kidding? It’s a perfectly good chicken leg.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought you had plans with Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, quite the kerfuffle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then Amy got mad and left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Walked right out the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Trust me, call her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Amy (on skype)</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m mad at you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Keep going, buddy, you’re doing great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Kitchen slammed again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s your excuse this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie, you promised you’d move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ve seen her burp you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m starting to think you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, I’ve had enough of this. I’m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I’ve been to space. I will move out when I’m ready, and I don’t need anyone badgering me into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That was just for her benefit. I’ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don’t leave me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy.  Amy.  Angry Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>First of all, you’re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so.  Fine. I’ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy…  She’s hooked.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow. An end of an era.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Boy, if these walls could talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M_M’S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sometime around the third Almond Joy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. What brings you in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a conversation about girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it’s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don’t think that’s going to cut it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will that calm my nerves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Honey, you can’t make people like each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I’m having a tea party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You might want to pace yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My problem is I’m out of tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, please, I think I’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Welcome to Long Island, Tex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that she is. Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m a callous egomaniac. She’s gonna leave me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, she won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, she won’t. I’m great.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother’s house. You are now the only woman in my life who I’ll see naked in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know this wasn’t easy. You doing okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m fine. It’s just her I’m worried about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aw, she’ll be okay. She’s a grown woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. It’s just ever since my dad left, I’ve felt responsible for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She’s lucky you were there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, she’s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she’d smile. For a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aw, crap. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Where we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Grab a box. We’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, but I want to live here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can’t we talk about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Wil Wheaton!  Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wouldn’t you like to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Have you been drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just tea. S’the best tea I’ve ever had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll tell you. I’m from Texas. Need I say more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You insulted my woman. I’m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we’re gonna fight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My fists are not up here because I’m milking a giant invisible cow. They’re up to beat an apology out of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Wil</speaker><content>Okay, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
