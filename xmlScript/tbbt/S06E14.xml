<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll eat later. Right now, I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, so, I’m out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t waste my time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You get that these are personalised action figures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Honey, if you want one, just get one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re still out, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He’s dividing both sides by I. He’s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He’s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Cooper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nobel. Kripke. Don’t look at my board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a drawing of a really cool train. Don’t look at that, either. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>I have some bad news. You’re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I’m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That’s hard cheese, Barry. You’re one of the good ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>No, they’re making us work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, man. Look at my nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe it’s a shipping problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t believe I wasted all that money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They could show bloopers. Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is Sheldon’s “I’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on, let’s just go to your place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Shouldn’t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Penny (entering apartment)</speaker><content>You doing okay, sweetie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don’t know where you’re from, but where I’m from, that means I’m not doing okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Want me to make you some tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, cocoa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, teacher! Me! Me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See, I did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What beverage do you make for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And yet, now you’re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why don’t you show me yours first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>How do I know you’re not going to do that with mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because I’m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other’s work, meet again tomowow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Nice twy. This is bwank paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Cough it up, Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>If this one’s bwank, too, I’m going to be fuwious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You! Always bet on black.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Get that waste of money out of my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them.  He’s right, dawg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please, I’m working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? How’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it’s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have always wanted a 3-D printer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, but they’re so expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, the prices have been coming down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We don’t need Malibu Koothrappali’s dream house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Really, smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I’m supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it’s hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You’ve been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It’s his mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do we have to lose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, we’re going to be late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t go in today. I’m sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>128.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did you do, put this in your tea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, geez. What a grouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think this thing was made in China.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Eh, what can you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I wish I was in better shape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stop holding your stomach in. I’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, you can suck it in a little bit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Don’t pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>You have a girlfwiend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I’m getting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>You wucky bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Kripke</speaker><content>Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we’re gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, good, you’re home. Got a little surprise for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Say hello to my little friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, my God. That’s so cute. I didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, Howie, I love these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought you might.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Were they expensive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Didn’t cost a thing. I made them myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>$5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s kind of dawning on me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t believe you. Howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, but we’re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, here’s how love works. You’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell Kripke the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is my coitus whimsically inventive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know you’re joking, but I’d be okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You ever going to sleep with Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s awfully personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, word around the university is I’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, we’re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, first of all, I’m quite fond of Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then what’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I’m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy’s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a possibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Penny (under breath while hitting Leonard)</speaker><content>Oh, my God!  Sheldon, I know this wasn’t easy for you, and I’m really glad we could have this conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Penny (under breath while hitting Leonard)</speaker><content>Oh, my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, that’s harsh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant.</content></utterance>
