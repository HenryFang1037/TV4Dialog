<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, one gravy boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>When I get married I’m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ew, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>‘Cause I’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don’t tell Sheldon. He’s still a flight risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What about you, Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What about me what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But do you think you’ll ever get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s a sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You’re not answering the question. Do you love him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, of course I love him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It doesn’t sound like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you tell him that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, he’d just take it the wrong way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It means he is special and smart and nice and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you gonna break up with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Maybe. I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I had no idea you were unhappy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s the thing, I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all. It’s just, I don’t know, I, I’ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. I’m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amy, you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can’t help ya, kid. Whenever I’m around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj (voice off)</speaker><content>Hey, buddy, how’s it going up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t have to shout, Raj. It’s not like I’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, is it everything you hoped it would be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s better. I wake up every morning and I just can’t believe I’m on this incredible adventure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Excuse me. I’m talking to my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Dimitri</speaker><content>If you do good job, next time we give you brush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Funny. We’re always giving each other a hard time up here. It’s kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, I read you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Copy that. Over. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am talking to a man in space. If you don’t have the  then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re out of your mind,Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Come on, scrub it up, Loops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, all right. I gotta go. There’s a meteor shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Over and out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bye, buddy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Stuart (knocking and entering)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart, come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I didn’t authorize this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you are not in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he’s Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I can take them or leave them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s Raisinets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay. Should we go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wolowitz went to MIT. What’s your educational background?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I went to art school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Equally ridiculous. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, of course you do. You’re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just watch the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not fair. Penny isn’t making Leonard hold hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>There might be a reason for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny said she’s not sure she wants to be Leonard’s girlfriend anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She’s not sure how she feels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They’re fish with a sword for a nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Regardless, don’t say anything to Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes, please, Penny will kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Raisinet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shh, we’re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe your tongue is shrinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon (measures)</speaker><content>Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m starting to get a sense of it. Don’t worry. I’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. I appreciate that. You’re good people, Leonard. There’s something I need to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you. So I guess there’s two things I can’t tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wish there were more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good night. I’m sorry. This is really important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where exactly did your mother have you tested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I think I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is literally the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sleeping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was. Now I’m having a nightmare. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Never mind. I still can’t tell you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny?  Penny?  Penny? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God. Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You frightened me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing in my bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How did you even get in, you weirdo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, really? I’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it’s weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What do you want, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you’re up, we could talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Talk about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, go home, crazy man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today’s North Korea, he’s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, what did Amy tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, very well. I can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I’m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Worst bedtime story ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My point is I don’t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I’m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please don’t hurt my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is the last thing I want to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hang on, please. Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She’s pretty mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know. She’s yelling at me right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right then, so we’re all on the same page. Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Bernie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>There’s my hubby. How’s everything going up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, it’s okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nothing. Everything’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The other astronauts are being mean to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, what are they doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, Howie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can see it if you want. It’s on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why don’t you stand up to them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What am I supposed to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know. Say, being mean is lame, what’s cool is being nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great, I’ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gelatinous Sphere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Focused Locust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Temple of Yip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>We’re gonna try to meet some girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>‘Cause that’s what we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>In case you didn’t follow that, I’m the coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard? Maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would I be interested? I have Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I’d get a back-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, please don’t ruin this for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I like Mark Ruffalo, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
