<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>This is an easy one. You love this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Still think it’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s not you. Now think, there’s a car named after him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ’cause it’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>How about this, he’s a poor man’s Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Tesla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, how did it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Did they figure out what’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He’s gonna do it next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would you have surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I can’t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, back off, he’s all mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But you don’t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, I’ve heard you complain about his snoring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, for the first five or six years, but I’ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. End of story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. I’m done talking about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe it was your turn in the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let’s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think you could give a better clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll ever sleep without it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s your problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have to be honest with you Leonard, I’m truly worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I told you, there’s nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ve been doing some research and I’ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I’m going to miss that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Anyway, any ideas on a gift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, what are some of the things they like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He said that to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>They’re yours in the divorce.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. What’re you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not allergic to latex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>For the same reason I don’t wear the apron or the hair net.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. What about epilepsy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t have epilepsy, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buddy, I, I get that you’re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I’m not going to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find a way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, I’ll think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj (on phone)</speaker><content>Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, my parents just split up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, my God, I, I’m sorry. I mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That’s double the Diwali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You sure you’re okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t look okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>18 parts per million. And he’s still doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t worry about that. I’m happy to take you to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s nice they’re getting exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sure he brought it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re acting odd. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tell me the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Twenty eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fifty six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>All right. Don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. Take me to Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just go to work, he’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, I’m going there anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine. It’s sweet that you care about him so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I told you so.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We had a really nice swim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause I’m a liar, liar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s for the fire marshal to determine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You had to tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is he okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s still in surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I think she meant something a little happier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Knock, knock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey. What brings you by?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, muffin much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Told you, not funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>As you can see, we’re here to cheer you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s nice you got him that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, this isn’t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know those confounded things make me dizzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who told you to keep going around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was like a grapefruit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And I’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? You won’t even say A?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You bet your sweet B I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Obviously, I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don’t care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, you can’t go back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Try and stop me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why didn’t you stop me?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you talking about? We’re fine. And Raj’s parents probably split up because of Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don’t want that to happen to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How can I convince you it won’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not answering that. It’s a trap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So there are things you don’t like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I’m gonna chew my leg off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won’t get mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. Howie, be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, okay. I really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Who were you in couples therapy with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Was it your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It was your mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, that’s so sweet. I want to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thank you. And I love that you’re strong and independent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love that I’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>See, I am. Isn’t this great?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know this is all your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How is it my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you not to get the surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn’t even want you there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I’m done speaking to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Don’t be like that. You two need to talk this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, ’cause you sound really funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I never thought I’d say these words, but come on, nose spider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon will move out eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you’re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It’s like washing myself with a hamster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, how is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So, what’s up with you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re just saying all the things we love about each other.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, that’s morbid. Send it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s funny. Boy, I’m gonna miss these painkillers.</content></utterance>
