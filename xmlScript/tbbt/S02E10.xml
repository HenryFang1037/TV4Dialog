<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I don’t see anything at all, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you’re the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it a high-frequency whistle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Yup, there’s no inflammation at all, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then it must be a tumour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I Seriously doubt it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there’s something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! I’m going to bed</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll be right in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you understand that Stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, there’s one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I’m calling an emergency meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I beg to disagree. “A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A, ten consecutive nights or B, more than nine nights in three week period or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s absurd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, absolutely not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Hi, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh come on! Sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>He did very nicely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Out of coffee. Need coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Uh, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi! Stephanie, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m Penny, I live across the hall. I’ve heard a lot about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I haven’t heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven’t I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In Leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I’m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She doesn’t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Well, it was very nice meeting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nice to finally meet you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content> And I’ll see you tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, bye-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, that’s Stephanie, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, she seems very nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, she is. She’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Roommate? You guys are living together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Like hippies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How could I not be sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, let’s find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t you think if a woman was living with me I’d be the first one to know about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, you’d be the last one to know about it.  Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We’re not living together!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not… Where’s my Bat Signal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You have a Bat Signal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh, my God, we’re living together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? What was your first clue?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>New pants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice. Cotton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Actually, I think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>At least I have an egg. What do you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, go hit on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’s not my type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Too bad, ’cause she was checking you out before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course not. Look at her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Sheldon, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Didn’t they teach you that in medical school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I’m kinda busy here, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Go home, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, the pants that Stephanie got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, you can’t machine wash these. They’ll be ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you guys having problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, everything’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you’re allowed to say something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No that doesn’t sound right either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Go! Wow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wha??</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I’ve never seen anything like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I knew it! What do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>You’re going to need to stop talking immediately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For how…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Du-du-du-du! Immediately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Oh, hi, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon.  What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I just performed a Sheldonectomy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Gotcha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Listen, we need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we “need to talk”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Okay, why don’t you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s just a little scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Well, yeah, but scary good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Of course honey why don’t you tell me what it is you’re feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I’m feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s that? Really? Right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I think that’s for swimming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your pants are ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, um, on one level, really, really well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good, good. And then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And then the, the subject got changed somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You had sex, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, little bit.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here’s the thing, I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it’s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’ll slow it down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I totally interrupted you. What were you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here’s the thing. I really like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Oh, God, here comes the speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What speech?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together ‘cause I need my space but I’ll call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you don’t call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you’ve been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you’re lying, but I pretend like I don’t care even though I’m dying inside!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Steph</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, good! ‘Cause I really like you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Terrific.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey. Nice sweater.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s got a big bird on it, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. We’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don’t even know what a duvet is but I’m pretty sure if I did I wouldn’t want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re lucky. With me, it’s usually the other way around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Isn’t that kind of cowardly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. It’s beyond contemptible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It’s done.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, good for me. I’ll never have sex again.  I was wrong. See ya.</content></utterance>
