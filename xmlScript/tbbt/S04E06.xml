<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Gagh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>This is the worst cobbler I’ve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon. You haven’t changed a bit, have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would I change?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And your poll numbers just keep dropping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going too, I’ll show you where it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Alright, this goes without saying, but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why would I touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I’ve got a girlfriend now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s just agree they’re both hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, forget who’s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you pinky swear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Cobbler. I’m still laughing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>It’s really nice to see you again Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, you got any special plans with your sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, not really, just hang out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Train day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the Hollywood Carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t think we’re going to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well then apparently, you hate fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, my plans with Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He rejected train day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Abundantly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess he just hates fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Okay, so, what’s new with you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have a girlfriend now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Hey, good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I don’t know, I just have the one day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you like trains?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Not particularly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s pretty cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’ve really got to get out more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don’t have the sword. Good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Priya (at door)</speaker><content>Raj finally went to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well,  Sheldon’s still up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You said he goes to bed at nine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Can’t you get rid of him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>If the past is any indication, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Drop axe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Drop axe. Brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Give me a minute. Sheldon,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well then, bed mister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Five more minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t want that, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Leonard (to Priya)</speaker><content>We’re going to have to be very quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I’m lost. Well, I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re right, you’re lost, good luck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh! Leonard, wake up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh! Sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>It’s six o’ clock, I have to get back to Raj’s before he wakes up and realises I’m gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Mmm. Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Where are you going with this, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I’m just saying, I don’t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Leonard, didn’t we have this conversation five years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn’t mean I want to have a serious relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It doesn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They’d have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Aha, you’re funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I heard a woman laughing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Air freshener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well, I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you prefer ointment or cream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>With or without a numbing agent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Without.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. With.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Prescription or non-prescription strength.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Use your best judgement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Leonard (whispering)</speaker><content>Right, right, alright. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Priya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Good morning, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Making pretty good time, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you want to talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There it is. What if someone asks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>April 12th, 2005, Bob’s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, and Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay fine, I’m, I’m a horrible human being, I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean, you want me to keep a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know I can’t keep a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why do you get to be Batman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because, well, Batman has the secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well Alfred has secrets too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See, I can’t keep a secret.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ta-da!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Kind of busy here, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know, that’s why I shortened it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I came to go over your alibi for last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What alibi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so sure I’m going to regret this, but, who was I with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin’s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard (reading a napkin Sheldon has handed him)</speaker><content>Leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Mechanical voice on Sheldon’s phone</speaker><content>Top of the morning to you. You’ve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where did you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>An orang-u-tan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  Thankyou. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Didn’t see it? What were you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I was out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>On Caprica night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really, you, and where, where did you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>To, uh, Lucky Baldwin’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve heard of that place, isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What were you doing with Priya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? You slept with my sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How could you? We had a pact!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I… I don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How hard did she stomp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Very hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I’m good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I’d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude! I put that thing on my face!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I didn’t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard’s food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You put moths in my food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>For science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-45"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-46"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, uh, I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-47"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You used my toothbrush?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-48"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I, I, I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. But come on, we’re friends. Friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I’m sorry that I broke our pact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-50"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thankyou, and I’m sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we’re at it, you don’t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-51"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>As long as we’re apologising, Sheldon, I, I’m sorry I used your toothbrush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-52"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And I’m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-53"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-54"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>With real puffing smoke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-55"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-56"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright. But I’m watching you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>These are pretty god, what flavour is this?</content></utterance>
