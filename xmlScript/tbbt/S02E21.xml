<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Were you in the original trilogy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>God, I hope not. And no, I’m not Princess Leia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Interesting. Are you a Droid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>C3PO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, I just don’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Howard (phone rings)</speaker><content>Leslie Winkle. You’ve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I can’t imagine any of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, back to the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you Spock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t like this game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Aren’t you leaving for your booty call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who’s turn is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We were up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great, just start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s see. Are you from a TV series?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She dumped me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5, we’re never going to guess.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. She just said Howard, momma’s a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God’s sake!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t want to go anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I’m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is it me, or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ve never been there, have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It could be fun. I know my weekend’s wide open, now that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, then let’s do this, lets go to Las Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now? Right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can’t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you say, Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I say Vegas baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you going to tell your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sea World, baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Hello, neighbour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hello, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And how are you doing this fine evening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. I’m glad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Are you drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s Superman’s big ice thing, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you know, I’m such a good mood, I’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm, what smells so good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Have fun, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I shall.  No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, could I borrow some after shave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Black case, top compartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is a lot of cologne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj (finding a large quantity of condoms)</speaker><content>That’s the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not an email, that’s Leslie’s facebook page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, fine, I’m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But she did dump you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Grow up, Raj,there’s no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I’ll catch up with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, uh, if I get lucky I’ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I’ll sleep on the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sounds like a plan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I left them in the bowl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>In your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What’s it doing in my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home, and I forgot it there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, Sheldon, let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager, he’ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sure, why not? And after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard (to barmaid)</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard (as he wins on his slot machine)</speaker><content>Dude, check it out. That’s laundry for a month!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Woman (leaning over Raj)</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj (taking a big gulp of his drink)</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>What’s your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Hello Rajesh Ram… Hi, Rajesh, I’m Michaela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello, Michaela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>So, are you interested a little party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren’t Ramayan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not now, Leonard, Michaela’s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I really need to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  What’s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? No. ..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe I can save her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe, but I’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I miss her already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why don’t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You think that’d help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, Howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. She’s exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Raj (reading Howard’s twitter)</speaker><content>“I’m so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, how was your day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don’t have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all, just eat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>If you’re really a prostitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>You guys cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>I am a prostitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>With sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think she knows what I meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>Don’t worry, I can take good care of your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Prostitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>You want the girlfriend experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, actually, if it’s not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God, I don’t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How can one person be a whole movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Where did that even come from, did he say we were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, just mail, no benefits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm, I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why are you asking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I really don’t want to talk about this with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course it’s making me uncomfortable, can’t you tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m uncomfortable, Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you, that’s very helpful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Behold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>A little baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m going back to the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Michaela (arriving)</speaker><content>Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>Esther Rosenblatt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so, here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it’s the one I’m going with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it’s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering’s beloved children’s book , The Tall Man From Cornwall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big Cornish head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I say one last thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Only if it doesn’t rhyme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alright. Goodnight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really, me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Michaela</speaker><content>Oy gevalt, you’re hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.</content></utterance>
