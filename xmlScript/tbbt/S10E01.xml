<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard? Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You realize you and I could become brothers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, drive safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Penny, wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, why? What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Stop it, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I don’t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And turned their phones off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Well, we can’t have that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It is funny when you think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Because you were driving like a lunatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj (doorbell rings)</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Air Force Officer</speaker><content>I’m looking for Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Howard Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Air Force Officer</speaker><content>I have the right address, don’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Air Force Officer</speaker><content>Is he here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Um, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Air Force Officer</speaker><content>Do you know where I can find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>May I ask what this is about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Air Force Officer</speaker><content>No, you may not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Air Force Officer</speaker><content>Have him call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard (off)</speaker><content>Raj, who’s at the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s not him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Susan (Penny’s mother)</speaker><content>Like what? Do they know about your brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>The world doesn’t need to know our problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Wyatt (Penny’s father)</speaker><content>Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>You really think it’s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Well, quit it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Randall (Penny’s brother)</speaker><content>Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn’t have left the state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>All right, that’s enough jail talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>You sent your brother cigarettes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Anyway, we’re here, slugger.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s great, now they know where I live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. I would not have done that for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s what he said to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here you are, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>I can’t wait for this day to be over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, special, like that.  That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, guys, come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>How is everyone today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Good, and you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Good, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>I’m good, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, did you defile my mother or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Sheldon. You’re being rude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>That’s enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t know his girlfriend very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>You know, It’s hard to believe I’ve never met Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Not funny, Wyatt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I thought it was really funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who’s there? Our family is an embarrassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>That’s not much of a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>Well, what colour trash do you think they’ll believe?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Well, you know, actually that’s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. And he’s never been to Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Maybe we meet halfway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>You’re not seriously going to visit each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>And why wouldn’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Oh please, you’re just saying this to antagonize me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that’s just a bonus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine, then you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Well, I don’t want to stay here with her. I’ll go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>I’ll go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That still leaves me here with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on, hang on. We’re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can’t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can’t be together. Leonard and I can’t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don’t like his face. Oh, here. I’ve got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Who’s ready for a wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Great, now I have to start all over.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>See what happens when you work hard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>I’ll drink to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Haven’t you had enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Penny drinks more than I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I learned from the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>You see what I’ve gotta put up with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>It’s called getting caught, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Hey, there he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard. It’s so nice to see you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>We are not white trash.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>Yes, I am. I’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I’ve caused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Mary</speaker><content>Oh, so am I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You made God sad today, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It was a lot hotter than it sounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Alfred</speaker><content>You’re a patient young lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s really stupid advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know that hurts my feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Calm down, try not to think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why do I bother talking to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s the point of that story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.  There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>So, what do you do for a living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>Mommy, you want to take this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Um, Randall’s in between jobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>And court appearances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>It’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I’m looking forward to meeting his father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Beverley</speaker><content>Prepare to be disappointed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Wyatt</speaker><content>Well, I could use another beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>You’re done. He’s done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Randall</speaker><content>Not at all.</content></utterance>
</scene>
