<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ll let you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who you bringing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Who are you bringing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, uh, I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj (on skype)</speaker><content>Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>Pretty good, can’t complain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Oh I’m sure you can. Just give it a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>It’s finally happening. You’re coming out of the closet, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It means I like women as well as their skincare products.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Well, if you’re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>And just to clarify, a female wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Mrs Koothrappali</speaker><content>We married for love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Dr Koothrappali</speaker><content>And it’s been wonderful.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Quantum physics makes me so happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m glad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s like looking at the universe naked. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi, you guys got a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Knock, knock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Who’s there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interrupting physicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Interrupting physi…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>MUON!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where did you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You went to the comic-book store by yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Awesome!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh dear Lord. No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why, they’re just toys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They’re mint in box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re Collectables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Once you open the box it loses its value.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Excuse me, are you Rajesh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>Nice to meet you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And this is Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>You too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please have a seat.  I’m thinking double wedding!</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Voice of Spock</speaker><content>Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is someone there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Down here, on your desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Spock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>I need to speak with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Was I hit on the head by a coconut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>I’m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But it’s mint in box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Yes, and to open it would destroy it’s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To be played with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Therefore? To not play with it would be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right?  Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. . Energise.  Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken.  What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think.  It’s only logical.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>My goodness, that was delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>Impressive. What goes into making something like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’d like to tell them things are going well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, what page are you on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>I’m on the one where I’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I’m going to do it so they don’t find out I’m gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Say again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>I’m gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like, dude on dude, but with women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>I know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why me, of all people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you’re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m not gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I’m sorry, but you’re wearing more perfume than I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I like to boogie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>Got you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Lakshmi</speaker><content>That’s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Hello again, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What is it now, tiny Spock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard’s. You should be ashamed of yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re the one who told me to play with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Well I am unhappy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Spock</speaker><content>Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise.  Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ready for lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yep, one sec.  Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. Sure. How are things going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then why did she even go out with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, to other gay people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do you hear how homophobic you sound?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t want a broken toy.  Nothing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing. I said nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That was weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? I don’t even notice any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I dunno. I just think it’s a waste.  Relax. I’m just looking at the box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is your problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mmmmm!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, nice job, man-hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would you open mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you should talk to Stuart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What is the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, that I believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, is that one mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, hand it over so I can open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And that’s a lie, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.</content></utterance>
