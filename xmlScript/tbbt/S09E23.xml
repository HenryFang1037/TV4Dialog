<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Taylor Swift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes. Pi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. Kardashian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>More specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Khloe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you guys doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, let me try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, who is Mike Drop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Or a way for you to avoid her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I’d like for us to have a good relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is very mature of you, so I’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, back to learning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Or as I know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>When’s the screening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny’s busy with my mother, so I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In fact, that’s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, I’d say by three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re really going without me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I’ll be cutting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>People do it all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>If you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>And now I feel worse again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>I’m not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He’s battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about you. What would you like to do while you’re here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Dear, I’m a psychiatrist. You don’t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Very well. What’s the last book you read?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Penny, it’s only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>That was a joke, dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>So just the two of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you doing here? You’re not Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>No, it’s not like that. There’s a long line he’d rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re not going shopping together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You sure? I’m happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Look, lady, I just work here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Stuart, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, I’m not upset with you, but Amy’s pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You’re darn right it’s fair play, you selfish jerk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, just when I think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Maybe he couldn’t get a word in edgewise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’ve been going on and on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Oh, it’s all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It’s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Well, I do admire your resolve. You’re an extraordinary woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with her like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Amy’s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You’re with her son, who she doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Yes. Well, what can you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Amy (knock on door)</speaker><content>Maybe it’s Sheldon, here to say he’s sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Sheldon says he’s sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Bernadette, I’ll give you five dollars to slam the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I would have done it for three.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Boy, all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Uh, no, she’s still pretty mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I said, Sheldon says he’s sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I’ll lose my spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I’m happy to hold your place till you get back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You would do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Consider it my way of getting more of your money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re a good man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Oh, I didn’t realize you two work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, we don’t exactly. I’m a microbiologist for the research team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Oh, what are you currently developing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>That’s interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>It was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, let’s get back to Penny. Hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, it has seat warmers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Amy.  Amy.  Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, you’re a peach. Beverly, we’ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How long have I had spinach in my teeth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Since the airport, dear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You look like you come with a kickstand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can’t make me feel bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, how’d it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It went well. Yeah, I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Anyone else need anything before I go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That’s mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You made it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you see that? He just cut the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>He’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re near the front of the line. We’ll get in either way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if every person in front of us let someone cut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’d still get in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if each of those people let someone cut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Still get in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But then each of those people let someone cut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We’d still get in, but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, please don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, uh, I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Oh, uh, I’m with my friends. It’s cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You need to go to the back of the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Uh, who made you line monitor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Is this guy for real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Boy, I wish I could say no.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, he’s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Your relationship with him is fascinating. I’m preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, sure. I’ll, I’ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do I think he’d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Wonderful. I’ll give you my contact information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I’m getting nowhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I’ll take you not insulting me to my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>My intention was never to insult you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>Well, it’s not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, good example.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s got him there. The D even stands for department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I most certainly did not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I saw you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>If you’re feeling dizzy, it’s because the tables have turned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Buddy, let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I can’t. This isn’t right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You did everything you could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I could’ve done more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>I’m still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son’s wedding is difficult to ignore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I know how you feel. She didn’t invite any of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It was spur of the moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>I could’ve watched it on the Internet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>No, I would’ve said you’re making a huge mistake. But an invitation would’ve been nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You really think we made a mistake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>At the time I did. But I’ve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you’re interested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Beverly</speaker><content>I would find that perfectly acceptable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howie? You doing okay? You’ve been in there a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Howard (through bathroom door)</speaker><content>I’m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that’s a good question, Jim. Don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.</content></utterance>
