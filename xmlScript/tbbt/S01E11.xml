<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>O-o-o-o-h! Again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just reset the board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny (knocking and entering)</speaker><content>Hi guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did you get my mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke’s only funny in Nebraska.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>From the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Boy, it’s good to be back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How was your family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon (running to opposite side of the room)</speaker><content>What kind of sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, the flu I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe Friday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Friday, was that morning or afternoon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I… I don’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Think woman, who blew their nose and when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, I’m sure she’s not contagious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, you’ll have to excuse Sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s okay, I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No problem. Welcome home. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>With lime jello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard! If I’m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what’s growing in my throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I’m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m going back to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait.  Put this in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mix pancake batter in this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s right here on the bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear God.  Leonard! Leonard, I’m sick!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon (voice off)</speaker><content>Leonard! Leonard I’m sick!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet)</speaker><content>Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard?  Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard (voice on phone)</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard (running down stairs)</speaker><content>I’m at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At six-thirty in the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On Sunday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They asked me to come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t hear the phone ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They texted me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No kidding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Drink whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then make soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We don’t have soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m at work, Sheldon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that a dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the lab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Howard, it’s the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know it’s the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Well who’s calling at this ungodly hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Well ask them why they’re calling at this ungodly hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How can I ask them when I’m talking to you!  Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, it’s Leonard, code Milky Green.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Dear Lord, not Milky Green!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Affirmative, with fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Who’s on the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Why is he calling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon’s sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Were you playing with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>For God’s sake, Ma, I’m twenty six years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Chocolate milk and eggoes please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, listen to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on, call waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard (voice)</speaker><content>No, don’t, don’t….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, I’m sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Howard (imitating his mother’s voice)</speaker><content>Howard’s sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Then call your own mother.  It was Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I tried to stop you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ’06.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Howard’s Mother</speaker><content>I just had the carpets steamed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s a negatory. But there’s a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Five movies, two hours apiece. It’s a start.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Waitress</speaker><content>Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sick, thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How could you have gotten it from me, I’m not sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You’re doomed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny (over Sheldon’s strange throat clearance)</speaker><content>Why didn’t you just….  Why didn’t you just have soup at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You can have soup delivered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, what kind of soup do you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Then surprise me.  Would you call that moss green or forest green?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Look at this, everyone went chimp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well I’d like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hi Penny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m… uh… at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You sound funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m… uh… in a… I’m in a radiation suit. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well I’m at work too, and you’ll never guess who’s here infecting my entire station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard (To Howard and Raj)</speaker><content>Sheldon’s at the Cheesecake Factory.  Just tell him to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He won’t leave, he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Leonard (To Howard and Raj)</speaker><content>He’s paranoid, and he’s established a nest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Can you please come get him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I’d be… I’d be happy to Penny.  Oh my God there’s a breech in the radiation unit  The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye!  I feel really guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You did what you had to do. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks for bringing me home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, it’s okay, I didn’t really need to work today, it’s not like I have rent or car payments or anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, you feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait, where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, home, to write some bad cheques.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re going to leave me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven’t you ever been sick before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, of course, but, not by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really, never?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Studying abroad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I’m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And there was no-one there to take care of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, sweetie, I’ll take care of you, what do you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Agreed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I’m blind here guys, can you help me find them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry.  Found ‘em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry, don’t you have a spare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Unless Sheldon’s there, in which case you’ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard (Dials phone)</speaker><content>Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye.  He’s home, I’m screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How about Lasic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want me to get eye surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m thinking!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I’ll see you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, Sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>But Sheldon….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can’t believe I’m doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Penny (after a loud sigh)</speaker><content>Soft kitty, warm kitty…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Penny (through gritted teeth)</speaker><content>Little ball of fur.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you see, what do you see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The living room appears to be empty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m not going in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No way, Jose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well I can’t do it, I can’t see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We’ll be your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Won’t my footsteps set it off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, you’ll be on your hands and knees. Now you’ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon’s room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, how do I carry it if I’m on my hands and knees?</content></utterance>
