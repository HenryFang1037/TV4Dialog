<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking about time travel again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then I guess congratulations are in order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I’m not going to enjoy this party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, I’m familiar with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, I was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know what’s interesting about caves, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well then we’ll avoid Finkleday, we’ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How’s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mahalo’s a nice touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Interesting, you should lead with that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t have buffets in India?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course, but it’s all Indian food. You can’t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well here’s an interesting turn of events.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What.  Howard brought a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Summer</speaker><content>I already told you, touching’s extra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Right. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard (to Sheldon)</speaker><content>Here comes our new boss, be polite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Gablehouser</speaker><content>Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>An actual real scientist.  How was that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe he fired me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Morning</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re making eggs for breakfast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As do I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, I’m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t want my job back. I’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I’m going to savour it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not just fixing my eggs, I’m fixing everyone’s eggs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And we all thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Use new eggs. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny (popping her head round)</speaker><content>Hi, hey. I’m running out to the market, do you guys need anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Four dozen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, one more time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Never mind, you won’t get it right, I’d better come with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yay!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How come you didn’t go into work today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m taking a sabbatical, because I won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So you got canned, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, maybe it’s all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no, I meant…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, sure I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>120?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Let’s say 4,390.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn’t you say you needed some eggs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I mean what you find enjoyable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon (as Penny selects vitamin supplements)</speaker><content>Oh boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, maybe that’s what I was going for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well then you’ll want some manganese.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know Sheldon, it’s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m not talking about this with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard (entering)</speaker><content>Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think it’s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s with the fish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s an experiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What happened to your scrambled egg research?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So… fish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fish nightlights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mum’s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve too much to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Like luminous fish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Shhhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right… I didn’t….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we’re going to be rich.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you for coming on such short notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>You did the right thing calling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Sheldon (looking round)</speaker><content>Mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Hi baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon (mouths)</speaker><content>You called my mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Honey, why did you get a loom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Leonard called me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know, but why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really, when was the last time you left the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I went to the market with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That was three weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, well I’m not a child, I’m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To my room, and no-one’s allowed in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>He gets his temper from his daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>He’s got my eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon (off)</speaker><content>I’m not hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, Leonard, don’t trouble yourself, he’s stubborn. He may stay in there ‘til the Rapture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are we so sure that’s a bad thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>I’ll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, honey that ain’t going to work, but you keep trying.  I made chicken, I hope that isn’t one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it’s a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sounds like a wise man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it’s against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>A death ray?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, that’s what he called it, didn’t even slow down the neighbour kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Did I pluck a nerve there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Okay. Alright everybody, it’s time to eat.  Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker.  Now after a moment of silent meditation I’m going to end with “In Jesus’ Name” but you two don’t feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I’ve ever had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>It was always Sheldon’ s favourite. You know what the secret ingredient is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Lard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, look who’s come out….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Shhh! You’ll spook him. He’s like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You’re a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>You don’t hunt, do you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Mrs Cooper (entering)</speaker><content>Good morning, snicker-doodle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>But intelligently designed by a creator, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What do you want, mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Well, I’m done fishing.  You put those on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Because you’re going to go down to your office, you’re going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>I’m sorry, did I start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not going to apologise, I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Mrs Cooper</speaker><content>Because people don’t like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let’s get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let’s shove off. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.</content></utterance>
