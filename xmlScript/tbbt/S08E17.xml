<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Again, it was miniature golf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Admit it, you’re a little turned on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You can’t be this proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because I beat you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, good. You’re back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We have some exciting news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you want to say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Let’s say it together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Together</speaker><content>We’re getting a turtle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Sarcasm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why a turtle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>That’s what I said.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, where’s your roommate tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>And the more important thing to remember is that I’d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s okay. I can come back later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That was a lot of puppies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you have approved?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, is this your first time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You went to the dirty store without me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, get it. Get it for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re making fun of me. Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. No, come on, I want to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How are the taxes going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Those are business expenses. You can write those off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.  Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She’s gonna know I was looking in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why were you looking in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Aw. I’m gonna miss her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I thought it’d be a little more, just more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Almost 1am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I would at least mention it before filling out the application.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Please don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yep, you’re mad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, let me see the damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>With what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Why do you even want to do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Can’t you just tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I made a video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon (on video)</speaker><content>I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard (on video)</speaker><content>You mean this weirdly suspicious one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Sheldon (on video)</speaker><content>Yes. Open it and check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard (on video)</speaker><content>I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Sheldon (on video)</speaker><content>But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How did you get paint in your eye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s fine. You just need two more nails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, where should I put them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In Emily’s eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Raj? I’m back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How was the hospital?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Fine. What were you doing in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You were looking in my night stand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’ve never snooped around my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I can’t believe you don’t trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>She sounds really mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We should hang up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah, we should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>But we’re not going to, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What happened to snooping is wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We sure did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, where do we want to hang it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But it’s an expression of our love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And our butts. Not hanging it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Seems a shame to throw it away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>God, I love you. I love you so much.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I think I’m gonna go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sure. Unless something better comes along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you want me to withdraw my application?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>What I want is for us to be planning our future together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>We’re on the same planet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Can I ask you one thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Of course. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Did you look in my closet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. Just the drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You promise you didn’t look in the closet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I promise. Why, what’s in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it. Good night.</content></utterance>
