<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes, actual women are the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I’m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you trying to tell me, Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don’t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Raj (arriving)</speaker><content>Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seen it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Detailed analysis posted online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, then what are we going to do tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How did we get actual women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Race riots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The zoot suit riots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s a semantically null sentence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t want to go to Flatland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don’t want to go alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. How come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, promise you won’t make fun of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course, I would never make fun of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I’m going to get a national commercial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard (laughing)</speaker><content>Seriously? You’re getting career advice from a psychic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good job not making fun of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She’s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why are you being such a jerk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ha-ha, bite me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? We’re gonna make out back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sliding into third.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thanks for coming with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Did you really have to bring it in with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on, let’s get a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver, please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would like a root beer float.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, they don’t have ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’ll have a Shirley Temple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, let’s check out the females.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. There’s a female.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. I’m looking for a hookup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You help me run my game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay. What is your game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Hey, that’s pretty cool. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>You’re very funny. I’m Abby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m Sheldon. How do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Hi, Raj. Where are you from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>The mysterious subcontinent of India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Ooh, India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know India?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>I saw Slumdog Millionaire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I’m a slumdog astrophysicist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Abby</speaker><content>Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Martha</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Martha</speaker><content>Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Martha</speaker><content>Oh, that is so awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, what should we talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but facts are facts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re welcome. How’s your fish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Amazing. Would you like to try some?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, the fact is, you can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe we should just stop talking about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>How is everything tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Really uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with…  Want your fish?  I knew you were going to do that. Doesn’t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We scored. I’m the wingman.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard (handing him protective glasses)</speaker><content>Laser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Had a great night last night. I don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell is eighth base?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How’d things go with Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, couldn’t be better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And that didn’t bother you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, I’m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I respect that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet.  One minute. Sis  n.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t get it. You had a great time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Please, Sheldon, I’m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So does that mean we can go with the girls again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You can’t wear the hands on the date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hulk sad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I would not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, let’s go see your psychic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You saying I don’t have an open mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I believe in ghosts, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And astrology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Martha</speaker><content>Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Martha</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Time for bed.</content></utterance>
