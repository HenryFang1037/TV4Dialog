<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, please, you’re not that kind of person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know. But if she orders something low-fat I’ll totally give her the full-fat version.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, that’s my water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My water. You’re drinking it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. It’s my water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, that’s it then. I’m dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won’t have you talking smack about the other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You guys ready to order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He drank from Leonard’s glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He drank from Leonard’s glass. Words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s actually my napkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, this is a nightmare!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Is it diet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s what you ordered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yeah. We’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>He hasn’t told her yet. He’s waiting for the right time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Howard, you’ve got to tell your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Uh, that’s different. First of all, we’re not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fire demon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Troll master.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Water nymph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry. Walking tree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Last one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard (reading a text)</speaker><content>Okay, the Eagle has landed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Have you met Bernadette’s parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, that’s my water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, dear Lord!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s not your water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Where’s the mouthwash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Raj (holding it)</speaker><content>Where indeed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ma, I’m home! Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz (off)</speaker><content>I’m in the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, how’d it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>Too soon to say. I’m not done yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that’s what a person orders in a Jewish deli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Did you know she’s going to school to become a microbiologist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, she never mentioned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>I bet she did and you didn’t listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She’s great, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>She’s a lovely girl. Cute as a button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s good to hear, ’cause I’ve got some news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Mrs Wolowitz</speaker><content>I hope it’s good news, because I’ve got nothing but disappointment in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma?  Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I’m gonna break the door down!  Son of a bitch! Ma, help!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Haven’t seen you in a while. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory.  Did I say something amusing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>My mirth. Classic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal, Sheldon. It’s just, ever since Leonard’s been dating Raj’s sister, I’ve had to keep my distance. I don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Jibber-jabber? I don’t jibber-jabber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you doing at work these days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Alright, come on, even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, my God! What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, let’s go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we’re going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I would think he would know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re a real hero, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I did what any son would do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m saying, it’d be easier to lift a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, how is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re running tests. I don’t know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>A heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thanks for clearing that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What’s more likely going to kill Howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you’re not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Disagree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Go sit over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is there a history of heart disease in your family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My family is the history of heart disease. There’s a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So it’s probably genetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come on, Howard, I’m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’d think that. But no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You can’t take that personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How else is she supposed to take it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I’ve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You mean sexual intercourse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Priya (arriving)</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard’s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie, wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Sheldon (to Raj)</speaker><content>I’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Nice of you to come for Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, he’s my friend. It’s what you do. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I’m sorry, did I miss something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>That’s a little easier to believe than he’s your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You mean when he was little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Not as little as you’d want him to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Sure. We’re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I do not. You are a mean little man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie, it’s not you. She’s just set in her ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s wrong with the bathroom here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. I’m not taking you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Mr. Wolowitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>It wasn’t a heart attack. She’s awake, she’s resting comfortably. We’re still running a few tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Can I see her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Actually, she said, and I quote, she’d like to see the little Catholic girl first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Me? Why me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Jews have been asking that for centuries. There’s no real good answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, well, wish me luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Let’s just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Why don’t I write you a prescription for Xanax.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon (exiting while the door is open)</speaker><content>Finally.  Oh, what fresh hell is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Wait, you can’t leave here, you’ve been exposed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, I haven’t. It’s all good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, the poor thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It makes him desperate to please women. That’s why the foreplay goes on and on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>It does, doesn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s like he’s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don’t doze off. You will never hear the end of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon (through glass door pane)</speaker><content>Help me! Come back! Penny!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What do you mean, a show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like, to music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So you’d do a striptease?</content></utterance>
