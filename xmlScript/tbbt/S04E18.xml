<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Sleep okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Yeah, just because you’re in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>No, you have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought about getting contacts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Oh, that’s too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>If you had them on now, you could see what we’re going to do next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I’ve been working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let’s see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Here, shuffle these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Remind me, what’s your birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>October sixth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>How about that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Is that your card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, it is. Very cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Fine. Give me a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Random man</speaker><content>Oh, hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry! Oop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>One, two, three, four, five. No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s your card, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Seven of clubs! That is amazing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, really? So how did I do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I don’t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I thought you had more important things to think about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Lets go hang everything up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I was talking to Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oopsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This deck is rigged in some fashion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine. Get another deck and I’ll do the trick with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m saying believe in magic, you muggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, well, I’m happy Leonard’s found someone. Not that anybody asked.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just two. Everyday and dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Listen, we need to talk about something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Leonard, I’m not breaking up with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, okay. So, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>It’s a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I’m just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I don’t care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you’re not ready to move on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You need to cut the cord with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You don’t sound very confident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Thank you. I appreciate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe. Can we not discuss it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I’m, never mind.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And was your card the jack of diamonds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how I got his nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil’s rubber!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know. That’s axiomatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Come here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You don’t wanna wash that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, that’s silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, bitches are the worst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, well I’ll see you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Did they make a movie about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sure, that has birds in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Do you really have to wear that in bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>So did you get to talk to Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Was she upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>I hope you weren’t cruel to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I am not opening that door, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>As you wish.  Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed.  Did you pick one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Is this your card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content> Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Drat. Is this your card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll be right back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatcha doin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s up with the infrared cameras?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Relax, we’re not under attack right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>It’s okay, I like Indian food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or as you probably call it back home, food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Why didn’t you wear your contacts? Don’t you like them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You know, my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Maybe. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny (knocking on window)</speaker><content>Hi! Hi! Just hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Small world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>You did talk to her, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>No, he did not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That’s our Lenny, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Yes, that’s our Lenny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how’s the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I’m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Priya</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It is pretty spicy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’d love to see that. How about you, Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right. Pick a card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bippity-boppity-boo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s with the wand and the beep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It’s transmitting to your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I said, ta-da. Show’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That’s pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don’t let me see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Three of clubs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That does it. I’m getting uranium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You ever gonna tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe. When it stops being fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So never.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, it’s all right. Walk me down. So, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure, anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Move out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, for god’s sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn’t it? She doesn’t want me hanging out with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes. There, I said it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And she likes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, she doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not really, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You can hear my toilet flush?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Leonard, I get it. You’re in a new relationship now. And I’m happy for you. So why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you really that kind of guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Good-bye, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Penny, wait.  Damned contacts.</content></utterance>
