<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hey, would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s pretty cool, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Anyway, I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excellent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My mommy raised a gentleman.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey. Thanks for coming by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m excited to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You should have told him to mind his own business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Mmm, they’re alpha males.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Huh, what does that make us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We could be betas. They’re second in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, that sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, that sounds like us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Whatever. There’s no alphas here, and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. How do you want to start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No. We can do this by ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Great. How do you want to start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. How do you want to start?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content> Sheldon.  Sheldon.  Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you’re looking for Leonard, he’s with Koothrappali.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no. It’s about my acting career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. That’s not on the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, look, here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re really not gonna tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What’s going on in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh. How do you drink it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I think I’ll have a beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>First take a picture with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You betcha. The very one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Howard, you’re grown men. You guys don’t have to do everything together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know. That’s why I’m spending tonight with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Trying to hurt Raj’s feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>With my honeybunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re being childish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m sorry. What do we know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You don’t think I’m a leader?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I was kidding. Of course you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>There’s my big boss man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m sorry. What was I thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, it’s just like he’s here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak _ Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And he’s all white.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They zip him up in that bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And Gertie can’t stop crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The flower dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, let’s talk about something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We, we can totally do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, you know what else it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon (singing)</speaker><content>It’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hang on. Not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You didn’t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, I know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We want you back on the project with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I’d love your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It wasn’t, so are you in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Certainly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I think we should do it right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Tonight works better for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Penny (voiceover)</speaker><content>Okay, it’s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it’s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up?  I’m starting to remember.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How is that building on what he just said?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Building on that, I’d like to remind you, I’m lactose intolerant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bah, you didn’t say building on. You’re out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not Simon Says.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re missing the point, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re out, and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Hey. I haven’t seen you auditioning in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>You quit acting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Second Girl</speaker><content>I heard you can make good money doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>First Girl</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>First Girl</speaker><content>‘Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Audiitoner</speaker><content>Chelsea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>First Girl</speaker><content>Wish me luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Second Girl</speaker><content>They’re gonna love you. I heard she’s pushing 40 and everything’s fake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah. I started that rumour.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Squeeze yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s not always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You let a guy sit on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I’m in charge. Now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re not in charge. Raj is in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Leonard, who’s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>He’s right. If you think about it, we’re all in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, I’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I do, and you know, I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Properly, at all. It’s just words I’ve never heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, thank you. You’re a good friend, and you changed my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You’re welcome. Hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>And you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>How about now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Don’t forget your wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I, uh, huh.</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Sheldon (on screen)</speaker><content>Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can’t miss it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>First Alien</speaker><content>That soft pink alien looks delicious.</content></utterance>
