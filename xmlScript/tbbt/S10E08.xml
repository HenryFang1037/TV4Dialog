<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>A two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Eating a whole Altoid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, if I’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, this is for science. I can be brave for science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, jiminy, that’s cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when I’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, just warn me before you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay. Three, two, and we’re done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You tricked me. You didn’t say one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It didn’t hurt, did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, fine, one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, my God, I just got it. Fun onions, Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Cleaner</speaker><content>Uh, sorry, I could come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no, it’s okay. I just found a wobble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Cleaner</speaker><content>Oh, do I need a mop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Cleaner</speaker><content>Oh, well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Cleaner</speaker><content>What is your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Cleaner</speaker><content>You think it would be more difficult than that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Good point. And you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Cleaner</speaker><content>Oh, uh, Isabella Maria Concepcion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, well, nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Nice to meet you, too. You know, I have to say, based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food I see in this trash, working here was ten years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Bueno, um, I’m just going to empty your waste paper basket and then I’ll get out of your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, please, allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You’re welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Okay, uh, okay, I have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Good luck with your, um, space exploration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>If you’d give me a minute, I’ll tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have such a profound sense of creation. I, it’s like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>These cells come from both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No reason we can’t start right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I understand. She’s the mean one, I’m the fun one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, no, that’s mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re dating somebody, who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What? What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, she’s right. As long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, fine, don’t tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There’s nothing to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How’s that broccoli?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bam. Thank you. What’s her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Isabella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, did you meet her at work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, in the telescope room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, so she’s an astronomer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes, this is all making sense. Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, that’s great, Raj. You must have so much in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, when do we meet her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, no, this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, good luck with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How come you never eat broccoli?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m married, I don’t have to be attractive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>You know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Still, I can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’m running out of ways to act excited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, enough about us, how are things going with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Mine has a fully developed immune system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, that’s enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>You’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>It’s okay, you’re allowed to have a cleaning lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>I think that’s called a mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>No, not for many years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, so, you are unencumbered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Just me and my son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I love kids, how old is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Nineteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s a cute age. They can do so many things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>He’s studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s wonderful. A lawyer, my sister’s a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Ay, Rajesh, I think you’re very sweet, but I work two jobs and I don’t have time for dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I’m very busy, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Oh, please don’t take it personal, I think you’re a very nice man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think you’re very nice as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Thank you for helping me. Good night, Rajesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Good night, Rajesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I’ll be thinking of you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’ve never seen results like this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Aren’t you glad you participated in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Make a baby? What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m not ready to have a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I don’t understand. I thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Not right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I’m not playing anything. We’re not making a baby today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Oh, Rajesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Rajesh, this is so sweet, but you, you know I’m working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Oh, really? You made Cuban food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of Legos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why does he need a baby? He’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hey, you’re talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Would you care for a brandy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good choice, it’s disgusting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who’s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Okay, I’ve had enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Amy, come back. I don’t know how to open the oysters.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah’s favourite things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you’d like to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>It’s okay. Uh, I should get back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hi. Howard Wolowitz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Oh. Isabella Concepcion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>You told him I was an astronomer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>I understand. Time to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, p-please don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>It’s okay, Rajesh, I’m a grown woman. I don’t have to waste my time with someone who’s embarrassed by me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I can keep this, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Honestly, I didn’t think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>I doubt that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they’re pretty, but I’m scared of butterflies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>You’re very persistent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s my one move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Okay. This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great. Where would you like to go?</content></utterance>
