<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, I have a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Unless you have the carrot power.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Just play a potion card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, don’t ruin the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How could he ruin the game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See? Ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, that is incredible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I guess game’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Because the last me I didn’t go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not Ka. Ka-ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ba-eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Nobody can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t remember that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So you’ve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where’s my shorty, Morty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, you can’t hold me to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, how come I wasn’t part of this deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, Raj, that’s how it works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Damn.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>But you have a whole bunch of ’em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today.  Good luck. That’s the face napkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, have you talked to Penny yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I haven’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, I’m smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human chicken wing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Leonard, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A hot friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’ll see what I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That would probably save us some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we’d be unstoppable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What about the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I have money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But this is other money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How does it different from the money I have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Half of it will be mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Leonard, help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Wow, you really are a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You mean, like a pinky swear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak again until middle school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Over puppets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard’s a really nice guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine’s coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>All right, I won’t set one aside for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>But I must have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll set one aside for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, I get it, he’s a bad guy. Sign here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No doubt, sign here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>From hell’s heart, I stab at thee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>All right, Raj, looks like you’re teamed up with die, Wil Wheaton, die.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, tell me more about the future mother of my children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>She’s adorable, Howard. I think you’ll like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Good, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Six if you count Klingon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Another delightful surprise for her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s your play. Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It’s really lame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Silence!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, Penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That’s pretty great, what are you studying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Microbiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, cool. So you could study me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know, I’m studying it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>And I said you could study me ’cause I’m a tiny living thing. It’s a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Do you like science-fiction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Role-playing games?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gonna be a long night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it’s your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You like magic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Long, long night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>I believe so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>What is wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>Everyone has a different theory.</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>How about computers? Do you like computers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I use them. I don’t like them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>A puppy once bit my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Of course it did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How about that? Einstein was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Howard (phone rings)</speaker><content>Excuse me. Oh, damn. It’s my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Are you going to answer it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn’t want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not as crazy as my mother makes me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You live with your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>No. That’s the sad part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, wow. You didn’t, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Corolla!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>More wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I’d love some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I’ve been hoping for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’s a date.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>I think he’s got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>You went to the ’95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Yeah, it was. But I’m really sorry that I disappointed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>It’s special relationship, isn’t it, between a boy and his grandmother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>It’s okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s heart, stab at him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure you can. Do it! Do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No! Not enchanted bunny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>I call my mee-maw nana. And she’s going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Wil Wheaton</speaker><content>Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let’s get our prize money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Stuart</speaker><content>That was fun.</content></utterance>
