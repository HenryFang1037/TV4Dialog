<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was going to get my mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, how you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bazinga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m hungry now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t have hot dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, where you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I was talking with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which one picks last?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I don’t know. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, God, this is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, you guys want to do something tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What about you, Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I never stopped hanging out with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be Aquaman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Since when do you take after-dinner walks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, since when do you take walks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Or we could go together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t think of a reason why not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on. Nope, no reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’ve missed you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All right, say hello to your mother for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You said you were going for a walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t say outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Woman’s voice</speaker><content>Here Bubbles. Here boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Which way are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Which way are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I parked my scooter down the block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m going the other way. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I definitely smell raw hot dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, have a nice walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I shall. Have a nice scoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You might want to stand back. I’m sitting on top of 13 horses here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Penny,  Penny.  Penny.  Here. I had to trade the others for my life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I haven’t had sex in a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Where you going with this, Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And you think my presence will help with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not going out tonight, Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Doesn’t have to be Asian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But we’ll have sex first, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>He’s been crying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, God, I feel terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you have a stomach ache, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No. Why, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why did you ask if I had one, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right. So, what’s new in your life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, my new shoes are not made for running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Have you been running?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m so glad you like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I do. Leonard never cooks for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t cook and you made me this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You don’t know that. Prison changes people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, where you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you, walking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>For an hour and a half?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I got lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Satellites are down. Solar flares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>There are no solar flares right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, there are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What the hell was that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, we really need to get you a girl.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content> Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, just come in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want, Sheldon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Maybe this isn’t a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You may want to sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m in bed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Point taken. You may want to sit up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Then why did you have Chinese food with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I guess not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, um, I, I can come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You used to it yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>His mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was going to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, well, then you, you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, you can take him for shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I just took him for shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re taking him to Disneyland?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, got it. Is there anything else?</content></utterance>
