<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Look, I know you guys don’t want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I got whine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I got the B word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Helping women? Y</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not saying people can’t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Howard’s disturbing recollections aside, I don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, I know, you’re too smart for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Got it. All right, I’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we’ve really helped women today. Let’s fire up the old Xbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, please don’t make this a school project where I’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>We’re not. This time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, you think I’m one of the smarter kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, you’re a tool I was using to make my point.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Some people are otters, some people are rocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about science, I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What exactly are you looking up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Leonard and Howard (together)</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based on real events.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Why don’t you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It’s a joke. Based on real events.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Mm, Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I haven’t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Weekends are too crowded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, blow off work, go on a weekday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hooky? I’ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Joke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can laugh about it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s a toughie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Let’s think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, they’re actually pretty excited. I’m their most famous alum. If you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>And now you’re also an astronaut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here’s my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can’t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there.  Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Kid</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Smart. We don’t want any problems.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>I can’t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>What did you tell your boss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o’clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Penny, what did you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>So, what are we gonna do first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>I don’t know about you guys, but I’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Ooh, that sounds like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re kidding, right? We’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Come on, do it with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, whatever. How does it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>We can’t all be Cinderella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Then how do we decide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, it’s simple. This was my idea. I’m driving. I’m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Excuse me, I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>In a library?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>People say I’m a little awkward, too. May I join you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, you can’t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Man (to Lucy)</speaker><content>You can do better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Lucy</speaker><content>Oh, we’re eating here?  We’re having a texting date?  I love that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Raj (by text)</speaker><content>As you’re reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, who’s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you’re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Did you go to the moon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, but I did go to the International Space Station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Did you fly the rocket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, but I was in the rocket. I didn’t actually…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>So you just flew around? That’s kind of like my uncle. He’s a flight attendant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I’m an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Girl 2</speaker><content>How did you decide to become a scientist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I’ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That’s just a little freestyle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj (by text)</speaker><content>My dad’s a gynaecologist in India, so if you’re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at your cervix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Lucy(by text)</speaker><content>That’s terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj (by text)</speaker><content>That’s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don’t know what you do for a living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Lucy (by text)</speaker><content>Web design.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Raj (by text)</speaker><content>Anything I might have seen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Lucy (by text)</speaker><content>I don’t know. You ever look at porn Web sites?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Raj (by text)</speaker><content>No, never. What is porn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Lucy (by text)</speaker><content>Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Raj (by text)</speaker><content>Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it’s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let’s get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Amy (voice)</speaker><content>We’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>It’s our pleasure. I’m Dr. Fowler, and I’m a neuroscientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>And I’m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I’m a microbiologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>That’s true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Unless you want to be Cinderella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Come at me. See what happens.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Raj (by text)</speaker><content>This was really fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Lucy </speaker><content>My battery’s dying, so I’m just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I’ve been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I’m gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that’s okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m counting that as foreplay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Bernie, I’m home. You have fun today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Yes, and I have a surprise for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Bernadette</speaker><content>Well, hello, Prince Charming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Milady.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, how was your… what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Leonard (undressing)</speaker><content>Disneyland. Go on, I’m listening.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Heard you the first time.</content></utterance>
