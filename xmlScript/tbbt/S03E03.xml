<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Are you fun in any of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>All right, want some French toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s Oatmeal Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, her bed kind of… broke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>A homunculus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Perfectly formed miniature human being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, you’re my little homunculus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Don’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I want oatmeal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You know what, I give up. He’s impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I know. What are the odds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Ooh, Sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think I’ll punch you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Come on, you guys, let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Fine, whatever. Are you finished?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Um, yeah, sure, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It does. But in my experience, you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Howard (arriving, in goth gear)</speaker><content>What’s going on, day dwellers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don’t ask, don’t tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, wow, you’re actually going out like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no. I’m going out like this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Howard, what did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>They’re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, how about you two? Look, I’ve got some extra tat sleeves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you carrying extras?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, In case I snag one on someone’s nipple ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I think we’ll pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>In this case, you bet she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers)</speaker><content>Yes, she’s pushy and yes, he’s whipped, but that’s not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>They’re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I think we’re fitting in quite nicely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>It’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>No, I’m behind on my wiki-reading I’m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m actually much morelost than he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Nice ink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Two light beers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Second girl</speaker><content>What’s your names?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’m Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Raj.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I’m Bethany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Nice to meet you, Bethany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yes, very nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>Nice to meet you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Second girl</speaker><content>I’m Sarah. Not that anyone cares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What’s this cartoon called again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>And it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re here a lot now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. Chocolate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes please.  Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I…  You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall.  You’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, I know what you’re doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Very good. Chocolate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Actually, it turns out I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, you shouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, this has to stop now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No, you’re not sanding Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes, you’re forbidden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Sheldon (Squirting him with a water spray)</speaker><content>Bad Leonard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>So what do you guys do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Goth food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>What’s goth food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Uh… blackened salmon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>No, I meant what do you do for jobs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, we’re scientists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>What are the dark sciences</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oy vay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>That sounds really cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>So what do you gals do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>I work at the Gap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Really? How about that? I’ve been to the Gap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>Yeah. Why don’t we go somewhere else and have some fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Sure, we like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We are fun people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Dark and fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>Come on, I know a place you’ll really dig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Did you bring the black condoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>In my fanny pack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you happy now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Not particularly.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Penny (voice outside door)</speaker><content>Oh’ my God, she didn’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What could she possibly be talking about for so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re not squirting her in the face with water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m not. And Penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re not changing how Penny laughs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Uh, sorry guys, that girl is  freaky!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Penny (normal voice)</speaker><content>Freaky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Sheldon (lower voice)</speaker><content>Freaky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Penny (lower voice)</speaker><content>Yeah, freaky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Have a chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>What is your mother going to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>She’s not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>What are you going to get, Howard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Well, I can’t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>Kermit the Frog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>You know  Hi ho, I’m on Howard’s butt!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>Get the mean little skull, and I’ll see if I can make him smile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’d like the mean little skull, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>What are you going to get, Raj?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>With my luck, hepatitis</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Tattooist</speaker><content>Okay, here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Tattooist</speaker><content>That’s just rubbing alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Tattooist</speaker><content>I’m putting on the stencil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What comes after the stencil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Tattooist</speaker><content>This.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Aaaaaargh! Okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>What’s the big deal, you’ve done this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, I haven’t, look.  I’m sorry, I’m a fraud, he’s a fraud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>We’re both frauds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I think I covered that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But I was summing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We’re not goth, we’re just guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Very, very smart guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>So you were totally scamming us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yes. And I wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Bethany</speaker><content>I’m leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I’m leaving too. Not that anyone cares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>When we tell this story, let’s end it differently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Mmm, these are so good</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>What’s that got to do with the story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Fine, they smelled good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>We say they’re in a very intimate area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Wow. What a great night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Could happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>I wonder how they smell.</content></utterance>
