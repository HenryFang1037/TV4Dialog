<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, it’s done. Look, guys, for the future, I don’t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon, it’s not that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Not bad? It’s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>So, there is a number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Shh-shh-shh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The people upstairs are moving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The horror!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why would you just say something like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no, no, no…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How else was I supposed to say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>The horror!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Sheldon, I’m sure it’s going to be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>No, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I never met them. That’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure the new people will be just as quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You can’t know that. How can you possibly know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>You’re right, I can’t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Why are you making it worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I tried making it better, he wouldn’t go for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>You’re right, that’s a great idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>The horror!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m sorry, that really is how it works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Raj, help me out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Raj</speaker><content>You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Howard (voice from inside)</speaker><content>Enough with the guilt, ma, we’ll still see each other. I’ll come over every night and have dinner with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>Okay, I get it, you’re angry. You don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Howard’s Mother (voice)</speaker><content>Little bird? You’re almost 30, fly, for god’s sake!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Howard (voice)</speaker><content>Fine, I’ll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you’re ruining my life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Leonard (into phone)</speaker><content>Hey, Penny, it’s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Sheldon (removing hernia support)</speaker><content>I guess I won’t be needing this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, no, the new ones, they’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>The box says kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Blonde girl (arriving)</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Blonde Girl</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Blonde Girl</speaker><content>I’m Alicia. I’m moving in upstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>That is so great. Oh, I’m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Freakishly feline?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We’ll come back to that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Sheldon…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You’re making her uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>I have no immediate plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Pro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alicia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Welcome to the building.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Penny (exiting apartment)</speaker><content>Oh, hey, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I’m helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She’s still on probation, of course, but I like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Cool t-shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I don’t usually dress like this. I’m going jogging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You don’t jog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I can start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Thank you, Sheldon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You’re welcome, Penny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Please, you look cute. I’m dressed like a slob today, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>I think you look fantastic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>This one’s a player, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, be careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Thanks for the warning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>I’ll see you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>See ya. I’m dressed like a slob today, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Penny (entering)</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, sort of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>How does one sort of…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh. all right, that’s cool, no biggie. He said he’d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, they’re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Okay, now I see the giant squid head. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Cool. so are you in a loft now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, actually I’m, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she’s also my maid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Sounds like a sweet deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I won’t lie, it’s pretty dope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Penny (arriving)</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Oh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>That is so sweet. Come on in, let’s open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Nice dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, this? I’m dressed like a slob today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I’ve never had such good-looking technical support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Oh, pish-posh.  I don’t know, it means shucks.  Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alicia is an actress, just like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That is so awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Well, trying to be, but it’s so hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>I’ve been out here three months, and all I’ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>That’s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I’m holding out for the right part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Whatever you think is best, cutie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won’t get it, but it’s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. The man says, “well, I’m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>It’s a little insulting, don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>How would I know? I’m not even sure I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Hey, Leonard? If you’re done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I’d love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, hey, maybe when you’re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll get to it, don’t nag me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Raj (drinking some wine)</speaker><content>Hello there</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it’s open, come in. Sarcasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Well, they’re all still up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You think I can’t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That’s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I don’t even know why I care. I don’t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that’s all I care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What are you saying, that I’m threatened by Alicia? That I’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yeah, what’s the occasion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Even though the menu description specifies shredded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Brown rice, not white?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Yes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>Good. See how it’s done, Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>You want to watch Battlestar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Howard (after Raj whispers to him)</speaker><content>No, no, PMS is different. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Oh, thank God you’re home. I need help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Oh, I’d watch that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Leonard</speaker><content>Okay, well, I’ll take you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Oh, you’re a lifesaver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>I’ll run lines with you in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Great. And afterward, I’ll take you all out for Chinese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh, actually, that’s okay. we already have…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Howard</speaker><content>Yum. Starving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>…chinese food right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>They’re gone, Penny. They can’t hear you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>I cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I’m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>May I interject something here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Sheldon</speaker><content>You got the wrong mustard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Guess what? I got the part on CSI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Oh boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Penny</speaker><content>Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you’ll make a great hooker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Alicia</speaker><content>Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?</content></utterance>
