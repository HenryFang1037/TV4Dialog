<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ESTELLE</speaker><content>Don't worry about it already. Things happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.</content></utterance>
