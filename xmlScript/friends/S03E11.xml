</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That was me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's all right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's gotta be the first one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write.  What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Where in Cuba?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm here to see Mary-Angela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where's Mary-Angela?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark.  I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's right good things, that-that is what I said. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green.  Oh no, don't you apologize.  Yeah, I'll hold.  He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That is so made up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye!  I got the interview!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.</content></utterance>
