<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Caitlin</speaker><content>Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Caitlin</speaker><content>It's uh, 27 dollars even.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, okay.  Here you go.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law  Order!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Don't get me started on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I was not flirting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And on your anniversary, for shame!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I was not and oh God, shh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hm-mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Big night!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, Joey on Law  Order, you must be very proud!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.  I've done it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-75"><speaker>Caitlin</speaker><content>Oh. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-76"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-77"><speaker>Caitlin</speaker><content>Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-78"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Here you go.  Now stop bringing us pizzas you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-96"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-97"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-98"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And thank you, for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-99"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-100"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?  What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-101"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-102"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number!  And not the one on the menu!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-103"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I found it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-104"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> This is terrible, what are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> That's not good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Grandma Tribbiani</speaker><content>No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But I already gave them back to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No you didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.  Where is that other earring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Why are you being weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Do you like it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I'm working on my flirting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh! I did not get that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, it's good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law  Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Go on, teach me something about men and women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well that's pathetic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Again true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And this goes for all guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know, I know! What am I going to do?  Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah, all right.  Ooh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Grandma Tribbiani</speaker><content>Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So, you're old and small.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>   Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh that'd be great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.</content></utterance>
