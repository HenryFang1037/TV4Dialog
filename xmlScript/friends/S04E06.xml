<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>So, thank you for the delicious dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're welcome for a delicious dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey what are you guys looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, come to papa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine by me; hope she wins.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oo! Is it for my birthday present?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I have a call in about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>'Kay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, honey, that's so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It doesn't say that. Does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye.  I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sixty guests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican...  ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, you're not working either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, but I'm doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Everyone</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You can pee here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Everyone</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I know...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, how'd it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mon! I'm so happy for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'll have one, please. Plus my money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Huh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>Um, would you like to come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>According to recent findings!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content> Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mitzi is.....</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh  ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>I'd rather not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cheryl</speaker><content>Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, is everything in the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes. Did you settle the bill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No. I hate this part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, look what we almost left. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, that's not mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Mrs. Burkart</speaker><content>Dear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Just the matter of ...payment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Mrs. Burkart</speaker><content> Jack used to handle the finances! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Sure...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't know... um, Grease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Rent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes! Rent!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, so when do you want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, it is, at Office Max.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What did you get her? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>A pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Huh-huh! You can't give her that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>For three years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But Mon, you have to get our money!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Mrs. Burkart</speaker><content> You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She seems fine now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Mrs. Burkart</speaker><content> ...emblem of the land I love. The home of....</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What kind of smell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know. Soap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You wanna see her again, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, okay you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's, uh... it's endearing, really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig!  Oink!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Any luck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy."  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Aw, honey, that's so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Pathetic! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Our place, the hall! I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I got something for her.  It's a book!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> A book?  Is it like a book that's also a safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one.  Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, it came out to an even twenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.</content></utterance>

Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.</content></utterance>
