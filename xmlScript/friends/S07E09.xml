<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Uh-huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content> Thanks daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes! Yes! Yes!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and…it bent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I never had a bike of my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did the girl ever let you ride it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That is so unfair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Not really, I got to drag him around too! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m sorry, who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>I’d better get back to my desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>My what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>A joke they would appreciate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m thinkin’ no.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>No, not my touchie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What happened? I’m just eating candy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! Joey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why? Why do I have to learn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well…In-in case of emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What kind of an emergency?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?! Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit!  The bike is dying.</content></utterance>

Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>That’s kinda sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Let’s roll!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty.  So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean,  what would happen exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content> Uh Mr. Zelner, I’m the one who filled in that evaluation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content> Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>You wrote that you have a cute touchie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content> Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I’m kinda strangely proud of my butt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>It’s kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can’t figure out what this is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what?  It doesn’t matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s not like I don’t have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there’s a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now?  No? Okay, well uh, you’ve  got my fax number. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>No, don’t worry about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, you could’ve lost your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you! You’re great! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Y’know what?</content></utterance>
