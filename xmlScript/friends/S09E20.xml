<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>  There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What's so bad about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>: Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> These aren't suede.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content> Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Is he gonna introduce us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all".  An option that many of my students use.  Shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>You don't think we should wait for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Professor Spafford</speaker><content>Professor Geller?</content></utterance>

There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Professor Spafford</speaker><content>And that's not all I'm allergic to.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!  But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's actually a $1,000,000 prize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe PhD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.</content></utterance>
