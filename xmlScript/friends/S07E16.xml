<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How drunk are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> That’s the perfect amount!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-53"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-54"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh…  Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-55"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s totally meant to be.  Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-60"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…</content></utterance>
