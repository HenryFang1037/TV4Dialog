<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don’t like us do they? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How about to the street say from the balcony?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why don’t we just find a place for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. How about in that cabinet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How about the closet by the bathroom? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No reason. I-I keep private things in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Feminine stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hello Chandler, lovely day huh?  You!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.  If! I said, "If it helps!" </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why won’t you let me massage you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m curious about the human body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, if it means that much to you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Dinosaurs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A dreamless sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And here we go…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy!  Stupid closet full of bugs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go.  Oww crushing bones!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>She’s fine. She’s experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So but everything is normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don’t know what they are, but she’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you doctor.   Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You sure?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh hey-hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, everything’s fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, no uterus, no opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey uh, what’s with the candy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh you went to the movies by yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No I—Mona!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I gotta go back in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? Why? What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No really, you tell me what’s up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I-I forgot my underwear. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content> Uh, if you have any questions, here’s some information on Braxton-Hicks.  Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You’re gonna make a wonderful father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy!  He brought Twizlers!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>There has got to be a way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.  Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Then why do you throw like one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure. "Monica."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I just—I wish I didn’t feel this way about Rachel anymore, y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think…I think Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’s face.  By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I just…I feel terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong.  Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really? There’s nothing sexual about this?  Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh.   What are you looking at?!  I mean hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.</content></utterance>
