<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We're having a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel and Phoebe</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, and where is Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I said it's still nap time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey, there is uncle Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>18, uh? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, NO!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What, what!? it's for her hot friends!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>When they see this you'll be 52!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And starting to think about settling down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'd love to! Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> We were supposed to bring presents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, it's a birthday party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"!  Yeah... that's a funny cup!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, she's still napping</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you freaking kidding me, Green?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Jack and Judy</speaker><content>HI!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So glad you came!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>I can't believe Emma is already one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content> I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> There's something you didn't know about your dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Which one are you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can't believe Emma is still asleep!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know, what are we gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So you’re gonna... hit on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, no! My talents as an actor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or you could stick a fork in an apple!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I think Emma might like it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Emma might like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Um, my present!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What did you get her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Actually we prepared performances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Separate performances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But equally real!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> O K.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, ok, which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, why, it’s a...  one of her favorites, uh,  “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression” eesh!  “Love you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed  in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”. . And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Wow! That was amazing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you so much for that gift!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Amazing... amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Is that it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . “Sex and the single mother.  Finding your G-spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Everybody</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>That’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>After all, my parents died very young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>And my cholesterol’s off the charts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm so confused!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>To be fair this one does have nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And you know, I have a massage client soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright, 5 more minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Was that Emma? Is she up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Got it!  Hey hey hey!  Where do you think you're going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>To the bathroom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-46"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-47"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-48"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-49"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, it did not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-50"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-51"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-52"><speaker>Jack</speaker><content>Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-53"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-54"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-55"><speaker>Judy</speaker><content>Bye... Bye dear.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-59"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey? How could you just let them leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-60"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-61"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-62"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-63"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-64"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! I forgot you used to live here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-65"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-69"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What audition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-70"><speaker>Estelle</speaker><content>The one I told you about last week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-71"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? You never said anything about an audition!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-72"><speaker>Estelle</speaker><content> Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-73"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A monologue? I don't have..  I got it.   Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-74"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-75"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-76"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-77"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-78"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-79"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Ok, ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-80"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-81"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, lets just draw straws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-82"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-83"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm begging you stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-84"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-85"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-86"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yeah!! Let's do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-87"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-88"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Everybody get your toys! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-89"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok! I want the dolphin!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-90"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thats a bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-91"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm too excited!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-92"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-93"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-104"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose.  The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can.  Bye...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>RACHEL!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>OOH! God! Sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Emma's awake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, she's not going to remember this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!  They have to learn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's not bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I'm very impressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.</content></utterance>
