<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>....Are we still talking about sex?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Marsha</speaker><content>Well, she has issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Does sheï¼Ÿ</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Marsha</speaker><content>He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Marsha</speaker><content>Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Marsha</speaker><content>Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>So.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You look great. I, uh... I hate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Sorry. You look good too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>A lesbian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why- why are you here, Carol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>I'm pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pregnant?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Are you through with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Whose little ball of paper is this?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Eeaagh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Has anybody seen my engagement ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, it's beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, look, don't touch that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Chandler and Joey</speaker><content>Oh! Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Doy! Probably right before she lost it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>...Dinah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ohhhhh, don't be mad...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I am sorry...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I gave you one job! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I just... can't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Boys? We're going in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>.....Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow. That is not a happy hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Carol's pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ooh! I found it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved basically it's entirely up to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She is so great! I miss her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What does she mean by 'involved'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So what are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>.....Well, this is still ruined, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Curry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-54"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Mmmm!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-55"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I- I think they're great! I, I really do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-56"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content> Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-57"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>They all had a thing for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-58"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Aw, Mom...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-59"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-60"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-61"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-62"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Well, they don't have to know that... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-63"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-64"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-65"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-66"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-67"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-68"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-69"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-70"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What's that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-71"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Nothing! It's an expression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-72"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-73"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-74"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-75"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-76"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-77"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-78"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content> And you knew about this?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Your folks are really that bad, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Must pee. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You're twins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What does she do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She's a waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>The lights, please..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...How long was I in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm just cleaning up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>D'ya.. uh.. Do you need any help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh.. a little..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mm-hmm..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>A lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Remember when we were in high school together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Me either... </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Quack, quack..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Ross? That opens my cervix. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Barry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Come in.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Marlon-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Marlon?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay..</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Robbie</speaker><content>Me. </content></utterance>
