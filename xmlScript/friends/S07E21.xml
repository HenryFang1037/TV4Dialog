<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you realize you get louder each week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Let’s just do it right now. Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>  Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, uh…  Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! Yeah! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...everyone, this is Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Fat Monica</speaker><content>Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ennnh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like…  Or all the things you taught him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> There are seven?!  That’s one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s kind of an important one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Monica…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>"…when I look back over our time together…"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yeah?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You'll get one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah? When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why won't I be married when I'm 40?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Uh, uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You said you loved me! I can't believe this!</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Then all your stuff would be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, what if all my stuff was here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You wanted it to be a surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God, I thought…  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How’s Monica coming along with her vows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe that’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I've had a very long, hard day.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chicken? I could eat some chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Joe!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It happened in London.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>IN LONDON!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no-no-no-no! You can't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own</content></utterance>
</scene>
