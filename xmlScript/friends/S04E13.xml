<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>People can hear you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That is one good looking man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>No, you’re my first. Put the money on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dude!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>If you want it to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Here’s your girlfriend’s button. </content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, are you out of a job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That sounds great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> There’s gravy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I think I left a donut up here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s a good idea for a business!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, "So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?" And she’ll go, "No-no-no, it’s Chandler." And he’ll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> That-that is a good trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>They’re not a couple!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh-okay, I get the game now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Noooo!!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I know but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no, I’m there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You made pancakes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yep! Grab a plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no, stay right there.  Gettin’ closer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah, who’s playing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The players.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it!  I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now!  Yes I am!  Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.  Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mr. Waltham</speaker><content>In a moment, please, I’m in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Joshua.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, at least that’s a great suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.  So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Mr. Waltham</speaker><content>Rachel, you needed to speak to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No-no, that wasn’t me!  Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear.  The selection of underwear we carry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>It’s this way? Sorry. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Hey you guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Hi!  Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, absolutely! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>It’s a good play, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Clearly, I’m having sex with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you can understand, given how we started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rachel has a new doll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why don’t you ask him out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He just got a divorce right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmm-mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> You’ve never asked a guy out?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. Have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t even know how I would go about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin’?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey, how you doin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  How you doin’?  Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s.  Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we— the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye.   You’ve done that a thousand times?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’ve never done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?! You think that will work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What the heck is that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Did she call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, maybe I should call her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How might you be wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude, tell me she actually told you this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s all you’re basing this on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh my God!!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Would you like to go to a basketball game with me?  You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too…  Umm, who likes the Knicks—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, it’s ready. Come on.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know, it looks the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You used to have carpet.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How’d it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She is now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How? How is your fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…</content></utterance>
