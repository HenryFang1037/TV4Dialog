<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y'know what you should do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right. </content></utterance>
