<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>After one class? I don’t think so.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call  unagi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Isn’t that a kind of sushi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, it’s a concept!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a  surprise!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey-hey, is Monica here?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And of course, crotchless panties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  and her brother,  I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
