<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content> You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna do it!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> It doesn’t make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>On every word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yep!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, Monica made us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.  I am not happy.  Oh... sure you wanna eat that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Word!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, mine was worse than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that is so tacky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, that’s huge!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, do you wanna marry him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I proposed to Chandler!  Alright, moving on...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Well, do you think I should propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I think it could be kind of great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, ok, so how should I do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How about at a game, on the big screen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content> Nana is on the phone </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>She did? Who got her condo in Boca?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hello?  Oh, it's our nanny!  Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!  That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Menstrual cramps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't think that's what this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Can any of you watch Emma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, sorry sweety..</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-46"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-47"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-52"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-53"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I... I don't know..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-54"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You dropped it off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You hand-wrote it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> They thought Joey was a child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content> Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-54"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-55"><speaker>Amy</speaker><content>Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.</content></utterance>
