<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I cannot sleep in a public place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I got no sleep last night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?</content></utterance>
