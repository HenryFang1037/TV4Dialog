<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes but too me he's just, man.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. I really like his glasses.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>…so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Sounds like a fun party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wh-wh-why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, because she loves you and because you love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. It's not different at all, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Not unless different means the same.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Katie</speaker><content>You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Katie</speaker><content>No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Katie</speaker><content>Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Isn't this great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What-what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you do want all that stuff, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh and you know what I want!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I do not have baby fever!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I did not know that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross and Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>By me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, big!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross?  Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags!  I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right?

<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I didn't think I was!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. </content></utterance>
