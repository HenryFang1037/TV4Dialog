<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh, look at us! Who would’ve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I bet I stopped listening before you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go.  I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s coming from Joey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content> Hey there Ross!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice. Did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey-hey, what’s going on?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks for telling me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content> Chandler! Come on, I’m gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It’s a real space saver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Okay, Chandler, come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay.  Joey, trade lives with me!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross!  They’re gonna kill you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, why are you doing this anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! If only more people knew.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y’know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ticket Counter Attendant</speaker><content>Are you travelling with a child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ticket Counter Attendant</speaker><content>Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don’t take library cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>What’s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.</content></utterance>
