<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine!  Now, where’d we land on those pancakes? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Female Student</speaker><content> I’m so sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Male Student</speaker><content>Sorry!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Did she freak out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>The Librarian</speaker><content>Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>The Head Librarian</speaker><content>How can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>The Head Librarian</speaker><content>We are aware of the problem you are referring too.  But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself!  And don’t you follow me!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Didn’t you sleep together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please don’t get married before I do.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s actually going to be just family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh…wait…you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Erin</speaker><content>Look, he’s a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don’t see this having a future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Erin</speaker><content>Kinda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Then change it back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Erin</speaker><content>I’m sorry I… It’s just there’s no real spark.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight.  I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal.  Do you have a cat? ‘Cause it’s already happening.  Do you hear that? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Say again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Feelings, such strong feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.  Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper. </content></utterance>
