<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I know I don’t have too! It tastes good. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Plus, you look cool.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Well, I just called Joshua…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, how did it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And I-I am just trying to figure out why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Any luck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Noo. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, apparently he scares easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! I got my girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.  Maybe someday, there will be.</content></utterance>
