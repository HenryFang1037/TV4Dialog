<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You have no respect for anybody's privacy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Rachel, wait, wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, you wait! This is ridiculous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can I just say one thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>That's pretty much it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oops!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>But you tell it really well, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Okay. I'll miss you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, you think you'll do it on his couch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yes, could I have one of those. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Did I, uh, did I miss something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uhhuh, how did you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>It's textbook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, how long are you in the city?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  I don't know this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, this is my friend Roger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content> What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dad, dad. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife?  Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure. So how long you been... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Since then?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>...I d'know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You're one to talk. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What?  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Did you not get a good enough look the other day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, I don't see that happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> It's Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content> And Rog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>C'mon up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh, good. Rog is here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What's the matter with Rog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh! So you think I'm a failure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Isn't he good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hate that guy! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Night, you guys.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Ronni</speaker><content>Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Ronni</speaker><content>That's a good one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Hey, Joe.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Thank you. Uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ronni</speaker><content>Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>I don't want you taking that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ronni</speaker><content>Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>You're gonna keep an eye on us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Ronni</speaker><content>Wow. He's strict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Ronni</speaker><content>Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>What kinda change?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, either you break it off with Ronni</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>I can't do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Mr. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Yeah, but this is</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you're gonna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah. I really do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks, Chandler. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Get off!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay...who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ronni</speaker><content>Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Mrs. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!</content></utterance>

Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Mrs. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm...happy...for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Mrs. Tribbiani</speaker><content>Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Mrs. Tribbiani</speaker><content>I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Mrs. Tribbiani</speaker><content>That's sweet. Could I take her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>With this ring?  No contest.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Oh. They don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Intense and creepy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You're not? See, that's why you're so great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Roger</speaker><content>Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So you talked to your dad, huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So Joey, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!</content></utterance>
