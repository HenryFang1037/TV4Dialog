<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wh?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why would a charity give away a free boat?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know! Charity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m just helping the kids!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How is you drinking helping the kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker><content> Mr. Tribbiani.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker><content>Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker><content>I think it was valued at 19,000</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey, I was pretty close.  Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey! Joey, good one! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker><content>That’s good. Very good! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know. Okay.  Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Not great.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Lisa</speaker><content> Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make a toast.  Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Richard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?  A-ohh!  Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh you knew that. Good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first  weighing stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>If the school finds out you’re fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She’s leaving for three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>For camp!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah, Big Brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Eh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay well that’s good to know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What were you doing in Africa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Working with blind kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>You are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why? Because of the government.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Totally. I’m like 90/10.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> It’s okay, I got a plan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We’re gonna find love!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Definitely!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You mean a backup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Exactly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah I got that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hm-mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you serious?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I locked him years ago!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler giving you a hard time huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, you know Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I didn’t change!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe that’s the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is that some kind of boat talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know!  I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>There are?</content></utterance>

Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?</content></utterance>
