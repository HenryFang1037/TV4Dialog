<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content> So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh hey Rach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, well...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I'm sure you have better things to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ok, great! All right, bye!  Pain in the ass!!  That's off, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What's the matter, Pheebs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Exactly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh, sexual politics!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, that'll be great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's not what we're gonna do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Doctor Connelly</speaker><content> Hi there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Doctor Connelly</speaker><content>I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Doctor Connelly</speaker><content>Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, DAMN IT!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Doctor Connelly</speaker><content>Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Doctor Connelly</speaker><content>And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Oh, yeah! Let's do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Alright, have a good time. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Not gonna find any clothes in there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey, you guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Umh... Kurts Baley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>He's a pretty tough guy to impress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Tsz... NO! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's in Barbados.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But you come first!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>We'll see you, guys! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Bye, see ya. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So-so what did the doctor say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So you're ruling out surrogacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, I don't have to learn what that means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> ah-ha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How do you feel about all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Professor Sherman</speaker><content>Mmm-mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, that's not what you want...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Shop assistant</speaker><content> Incentive For Men?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I'll take some of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pheebs, that's for men!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy.  Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content> So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>You've seen all the movies...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Who else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You like Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, I get it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So can we keep this between us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi honey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content> You too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Zack!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Tell me about yourself, Zack!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I didn't say anything yet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Well, get back in there and talk!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh! We have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! What are we gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Stranger</speaker><content>Just be honest with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Stranger</speaker><content>And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Alright! Enough out of you!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! How's it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Barbados.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, just wake him up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don't like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright! Just follow my lead!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>You guys have such a great place here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content> Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content> No...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're just making conversation. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Zack</speaker><content>Ravioli's delicious!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, he's better!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That is so sweet. I love you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you know this leaves us with...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How do you feel about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!</content></utterance>
