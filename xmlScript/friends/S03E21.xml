<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...</content></utterance>
