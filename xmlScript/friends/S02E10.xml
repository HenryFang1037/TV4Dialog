<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Here it is, here it is.  The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>OK.  The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind.  In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153... sucking.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Half full of looooovvvvve.</content></utterance>

Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>FBOB</speaker><content>OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>So, what are you saying now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>FBOB</speaker><content>I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>OK, OK, don't get all squinky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast.  You know, after having slept with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>So what'd you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-42"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-43"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.</content></utterance>
