<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Mmh-mmh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I would, but you're the last one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> GIVE ME THE BOOK!  Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, my first love!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Dead.  Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hi sweetie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is Monica not here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine!  Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh?  I'm old!  I'm tired!  Hey, I'm hot  I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I can do that!  "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I'm cold!</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Your ex-boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, if you think it would help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We'll see how dinner goes.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Who's Gladys?  Oh! What a tragic loss!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why, you don't like her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really? You think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Damn it, I did not think this through!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joe...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Work, Joe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Damn it! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just pass it to your boss!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's good! I liked it, they didn't.  Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content> Sorry, looks like it's just him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I... I am having a good hair day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>So good to see you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I'm sorry...  Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Shall we? .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content> Thank you! . I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Oh my God, I completely forgot!  Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>So, tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>M-m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow, what's the bad news!</content></utterance>

The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Dr. Li</speaker><content>Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content> Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I guess!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Dr. Biely</speaker><content>Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What? I... I... </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Dr. Li</speaker><content>Half a dozen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>I see, and Dr. Biely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Dr. Biely</speaker><content>Three for excavation and two for analysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I haven't really settled on a spot yet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I like that poster!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Are you still here?</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?  Aunt Margaret's pants size?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No! Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Well... there is just one small... stipulation...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I have to break up with Charlie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Hey, you got one right!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, we're not keeping this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But it's an original Buffay...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! I sold that to Joey.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes I can! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Your ex-boyfriend is insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Did you get the grant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Benji?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Too little, too late, Benji!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I can't believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>or...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content>Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Maybe...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Oh God! I am so sorry, but...  I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>Benjamin</speaker><content> I'm sorry too...</content></utterance>
