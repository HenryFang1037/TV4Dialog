<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey, Pheebs! Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Ohh. Ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And everybody knows this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. Cushions the blow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh, Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, that was really good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks! Let's keep going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>"Smoke away."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Relax your hand!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Not so much!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright, now try taking a puff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y'miss it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.  Oh.. my.. God. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's ridiculous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Can I use.. either thumb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, excellent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Good for me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y'okay, Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What did they do to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, Satan's minions at work again...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What are you talking about? Keep it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're with you. We got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey. Whaddya doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh! Oh, God!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And this- is my reward!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, so this time I won't quit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Ohhh! Put it out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>This Alan again? How's it goin'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So when do we get to meet the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Let's see, today's Monday... Never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh, come on! Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No. Not after what happened with Steve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, then can we meet him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nope. Schhorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Paula</speaker><content>Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Paula</speaker><content>Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Let it go, Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you all promise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Chandler? Do you promise to be good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, Pheebs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.

<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.  Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>C'mon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Loved him! Yeah! He's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And did you notice...? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...What shoe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what I like most about him, though?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>All</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The way he makes me feel about myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Alan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>..I dunno, a little too Alan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I personally could have a gallon of Alan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, Lizzie.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Lizzie</speaker><content>Saltines?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Lizzie</speaker><content>What?  Oh my God, there's really money in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Lizzie</speaker><content>Weird Girl, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Lizzie</speaker><content>No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, that's fine, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Lizzie</speaker><content>Would you like my tin-foil hat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Lizzie</speaker><content>Please, let me do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Eww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Does, um, anyone wanna see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Nooo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's worse than the thumb!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, this is so unfair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, why is it unfair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I-I could live without it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh,  "you do, do you"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Paula</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Paula</speaker><content>Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Paula</speaker><content>Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.. it's gonna be really hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Paula</speaker><content>Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do you have any respect for your body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> God, he's good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>If only he were a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey. Where's Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I think he's across the hall.</content></utterance>
