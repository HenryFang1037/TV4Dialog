<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>And what did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Um-hum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>This man is my God.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Alright, I got it Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Then you should have said something before I met her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>There was never a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.</content></utterance>
