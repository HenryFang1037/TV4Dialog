<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Monica said wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! I would love to read a poem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you think you could get through a poem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> It’ll be a short one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohhh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you mind telling us what it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is DOOL?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? A brain transplant?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s ridiculous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> It’s winter, they are fewer people on the street. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Who are they killing off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Rachel and Monica</speaker><content>Noo!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She’s my favorite character on DOOL.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And the way she slaps all the time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes, but in Drake Remoray’s body.  Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Well, I'd have to say gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, straight, and not subtle. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh, he left his cell phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together… having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah!  And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nice try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well umm, maybe we could uhh…  Ah-ha! Too slow!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ah-ha! Too cocky!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Jessica Lockhart</speaker><content> That was an accident! And so were you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>Well, at least I’m not a murderer! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Jessica Lockhart</speaker><content> Oh, my baby! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>The Director</speaker><content>Cut!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Oh, just years of experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content> Can I get some ice here?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Say what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>I’m supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that’s not supposed to be until  later!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Oh that was a real person?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>I-I-I’m leaving the show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Who told you that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh uh, one of the writers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Umm…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I’ve been playing for 20 years—I’ll give you a tip! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ms. Monroe…  Oh there you go. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes okay.  Well now see this isn’t telling us anything.  Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> His new girlfriend!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think it’s the dying cat parade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re half Scottish right?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nooo!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes!!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why is your family Ross?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi Pheebs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You stole the phone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No I didn’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That is a different phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh is it?!  Uhh, hello?  Yes hi, is Rachel there?  Yes she is, just one moment please.  It’s for me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That is damning evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh  Hello? Or should I be  Hi! It’s Rach…  Would you stop doing that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hello?  Yes, I’m the one who found your phone.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>See you in 2003. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content> You’re absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Yeah, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>The Writer</speaker><content>It wasn’t my decision!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content> I’m having a conversation here!  You were saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>You’re so welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this?  "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Is that supposed to be me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my resume!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I feel like a snack!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How did you know about that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We heard you play all the way from your apartment!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Were you the ones called the cops?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because we hate them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We have heard you play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.  You try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay!  All right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Cecilia</speaker><content>Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!  All right, it’s a little weird, but it’s getting better.  Oh well, I’m gonna miss this woman so much. I don’t know what I’m going to do!
