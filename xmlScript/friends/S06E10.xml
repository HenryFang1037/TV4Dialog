<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s a good story, Grandpa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That is nice and we’re done. TADA!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See now it feels like Christmas!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Joe what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can see why that’s hard to resist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I like her so much!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi Janine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Well I’m gonna be on it this year. I’m gonna be one of the party people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Well they said I should bring someone.  Do you wanna be my dance partner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t really understand why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We are there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What, what are you laughing at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Thanks.  Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Bye Janine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Did she just ask me out on a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It was a dry day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh my God!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Got it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>OK, everyone gather up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica and Ross</speaker><content>‘Scuse us</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Here’s what’s gonna happen. The music’s gonna start, you’re gonna dance, we’re gonna tape, you don’t look at the camera. Any questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What? That’s terrible!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No-no, we do it every year!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh well, that makes it not terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But we have to!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well then, you should look with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I have a great idea for a present for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, that’s it?  A great idea!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If I help, we can find ‘em faster!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh ooh, we have a live one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, who’s it for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-oh. She may be onto us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We are so gonna find them this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Phoebe and Rachel</speaker><content>No, we never do that</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, here comes another camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right. No biggie. Stay loose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why do they keep doing that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hmm, how about my azzz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, this is hollow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, don’t look directly at them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Alright, no, we could look at them!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait, we can’t do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Phoebe and Rachel</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.</content></utterance>
