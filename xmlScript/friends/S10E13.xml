<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, why is Erica coming to visit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, those places! There's always so many people, they're being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> New York is awesome!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Thanks so much for showing me around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Yeah... it's almost definitely him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How's that now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>No, he's in prison. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Was he falsely accused of something? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you awake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really, can I hear some of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure, sure. Ok,  "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"  See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, you're not,  You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How could you possibly think that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmm-hmm. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Wait, wait,  You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's right, sex is off the table.  I am never having sex with you again.  Dr. Green, are you feeling better? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content> We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>No!  You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?</content></utterance>
