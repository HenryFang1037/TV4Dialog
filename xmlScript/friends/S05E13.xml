<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And you're gonna make them all disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Done.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Pheebs! Sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Pheebs, I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming.

I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!"  I kinda scared myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, at least you scared someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But the minute we start to lie to each other…  And by 'we' I mean society.</content></utterance>
