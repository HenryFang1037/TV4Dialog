<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’ll give up my ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay that’s so generous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And I think Ross is generous too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Monica and Rachel</speaker><content> Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So what-what is the exhibit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh man! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh that’s great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really? That okay, that’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Yes it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ohh! A man with a plan!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! No! Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>The Museum Official</speaker><content> You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I didn’t know you could get married here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!  I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>The Museum Official</speaker><content> May I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>The Museum Official</speaker><content>Yes. We’re very popular. There’s a two-year waiting list. Sorry! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m gonna do it too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Me too!</content></utterance>
