<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who cares? It’s a stupid game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why do you want to play this game so bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And, a brownie!  Well, half a brownie. Actually, it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin’ to feel faint so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hm-mmm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God. And that works?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you poor little famous man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Alright. So where’d you grow up?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh.  It’s gotta be rough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>"Where’d you grow up," it’s so simple!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And now you’re watching me walk away.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You are not going to believe what I did today!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is the matter with your hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because it’s awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You think this is clever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It is when you put it together with that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Have you talked to him lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  No!  Hey look at that! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM  Chip in it or something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey you-you got to beat your scores!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>With the claw?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Pull my finger——My hand is messed up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I am not gonna answer that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Huh. Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How do you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I don’t want to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because it’s embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay. All right, stand up.  Well, when we’re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn’t sound like anything, but I swear it works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh.  Yeah.  Me to. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I have too. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right. Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.</content></utterance>
