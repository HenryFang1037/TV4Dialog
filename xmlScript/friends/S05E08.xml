<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I couldn't possibly eat another bite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I need something sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Does anyone wanna watch TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Monica your remote doesn't work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh. Aw, forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's very nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's sweet, Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you aware that you're still talking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh God, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>The Housekeeper</speaker><content>More turkey Mr. Chandler? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Past Life Phoebe</speaker><content>More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying— Oh no.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, let's not tell this story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh, come on!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, it's not like it sounds.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah that's the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Big Nosed Rachel</speaker><content>Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly.  Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well it didn't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, that we may be able to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-38"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-39"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Then, you will definitely get him back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-43"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!  Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-44"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I can do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-45"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming.  Hey, what's up? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-46"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-47"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Umm, I'd love too!  Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-48"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
