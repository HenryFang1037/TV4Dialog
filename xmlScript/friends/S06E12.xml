<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, you tell a lot of jokes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey, why is your cable out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel and Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Me neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You forget how many great songs Heart had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content> Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Well, if you want, you can work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Flexible hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> He took my joke, he took it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you know what’s a bad idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Picking Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s right.  Did you hear something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s coming from the living room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I finished my book. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey, you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Phoebe and Rachel</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.  Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I guess it was kinda funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Well, people are different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, okay,  you’re not a pushover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> You start working on that list. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I cannot believe her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know. Where do you wanna go eat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I’d love an ice water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just being friendly. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, do you work here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Customer</speaker><content>Hey, waiter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>See, now it’s weird again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.  A smile goes a long way.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That true, I am flaky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s great. Good for you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I am not high maintenance!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I am not a pushover!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Who said you were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Monica and Rachel</speaker><content>You did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>That’s the whole part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Patron</speaker><content>Oh, excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Patron</speaker><content>I believed you were saving this seat for someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, you’d hire me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Patron</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Customers</speaker><content>Huh? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s my joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s my joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross and Chandler</speaker><content>It’s my joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let’s have Monica decide.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why do I have to decide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because you’re the only one that can be fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Don’t try to sway her.   I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, Chandler, you go first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can I finish my story?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you want me to pick you?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>See, I would never snap at you like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Continue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m not arguing with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s your joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi, Chandler. There you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi, oh hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.  Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and——generosity of spirit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really? I’ve heard better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You’re a little high maintenance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ahhh! You are on my list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>  I didn’t even tell him to say that. . All right you’re off my list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I’m off the list. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! That is a bad audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How-how did you lose your job here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, what are ya gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him.  Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>He can have his job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s great. Thanks Rach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Rach, you’re in my seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
