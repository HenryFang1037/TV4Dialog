<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>C'mon, what, you never think about our future?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night.

<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-49"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-50"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ok fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-51"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-52"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>We're not done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-53"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>I didn't know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-54"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.</content></utterance>
