<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I just lost my erection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know! My erection is back!</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>If you want I could loan you some money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You could do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No it is awesome!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How long was I in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don't you want to look through the rest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey? Leave it to the pros.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>"Marriage. It's not for everybody."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .  Who the hell are you!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Who the hell are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm the hell person whose office this is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Good one, Raych.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Okay, okay, okay!  You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on "action!" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, now. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>And...Action!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Cut! Cut!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Well, don't be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, that helps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>And...Action!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Cut!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too!  Alright, eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>And...Action!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Interviewer</speaker><content>So, do you have any other question about advertising?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Interviewer</speaker><content>Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Interviewer</speaker><content>It's an unpaid internship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Interviewer</speaker><content>Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Interviewer</speaker><content>Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Interviewer</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach we have a code brown situation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can you please, please take care of it for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright, but you have to do one sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavi.!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Incidentally, when are you coming back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>You said two weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey. So, what did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, so he said: "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Who dies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Okay, let's try this one more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>And...Action!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>The rest of the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, from the top, people!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on, I don't know what else to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine, fine.  We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You're pretty.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, Ross is here so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're gonna have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pants off Bing!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, they were popular when I left!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Fine, I will.  Alright, fill me in!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What!? You faked it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He slept with you and then never called you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Cut, cut! What are you doing!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Extra</speaker><content>Me too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Another extra</speaker><content>Me too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>How do you fix the chair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Except that!  Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Good, because it's in ten minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>You can do the presentation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I can't, I have a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I'll watch her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's really nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Then you're not gonna like what's coming.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children.  Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Like a month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Or a year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really, you want to wait a year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer."  It'll probably be more than a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I really wanna have a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I quit and you learn what I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes, please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!</content></utterance>
