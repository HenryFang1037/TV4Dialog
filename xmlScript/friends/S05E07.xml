<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, look. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's a pig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Emily's cousin kicked me out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Who needs a lease when it's family!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Health Inspector</speaker><content>Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, Larry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>No, bribes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's okay to laugh right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>Yeah, I was just kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>I'll check the kitchen floors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Larry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content> A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>And where is your hat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>Ahh that's the 2 points.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, you should really read that book you wrote.  Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content> Two pounds of Moca Java please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And you're not gonna do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Great. So the ball is in his court?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.  Okay, let's go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Larry</speaker><content>Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
