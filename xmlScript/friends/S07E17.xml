<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> That sounds fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Kristen</speaker><content>Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi.  It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Kristen</speaker><content>Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Kristen</speaker><content>Well Joey doesn’t like to talk about it but, he’s one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A woman in a man’s body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Much better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Kristen</speaker><content>Yeah, little Eric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s right! Wait no, Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So you’ve just married the one time then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well umm…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Kristen</speaker><content>You’ve been married twice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Kristen</speaker><content>You said the waiter ate my crab cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Kristen</speaker><content>Do you two know each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Joey and Ross</speaker><content>No. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Monkey lover!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>When do you think we lost her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Probably around gonorrhea.</content></utterance>
