<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We could, or we can have sex in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay mister! Fertilize me!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Weirdest thing. Did I hear——Mother of God it’s true!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Chandler Bing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Jan-Janice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>It’s you. This is yours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>I’d have to say…the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you’re making me eat him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? I’m sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>No, I’m sorry. It’s just my foot itches like crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll get it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Relax, it’s not like we’re forking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>Twenty-one hours, you’re a hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>Actually, I think you’re ready to go to the delivery room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y’know what? This one is. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>Oh my God! That’s the doctor who was in my room before!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>I’m telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Rachel’s having her baby!!  Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>That-that’s him! You know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>I don’t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fake? Excuse me? Hello? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Cliff</speaker><content>It doesn’t happen to me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Me neither.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two  are on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey Janice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again, y’know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up.  They didn’t have any sodas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s all right.  And so it begins.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s…it’s complicated okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything— Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Right.  Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.</content></utterance>
