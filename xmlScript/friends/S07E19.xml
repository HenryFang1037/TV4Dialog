<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I gotta make up the guest bedroom.  Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Cassie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow, I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, she’s 25 years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Subtle guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. Sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s what you say about porn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well when can we have this shower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yesterday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rachel, calm down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Just calm down woman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, I already, I already did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Okay.  I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh, here. What time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>4 o’clock. Food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Finger sandwiches and tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh great! Very Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And chili!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Both!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We’re paying for this y’know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Lusts of the flesh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t know.  A cowboy theme?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh boy me too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s me! Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Shrill?! The wedding is back on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hi! Nice to meet you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>Nice to meet you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, are you ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’ll be right with you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Cassie needs to stay at your place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What—why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You were staring about eight inches south of there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wafer thin ice!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I’m back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>Hi-hi Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn’t need to come down here today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>Wait Joey! You didn’t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>Well, the director thinks you’re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow! Sure! That’s great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>Terrific! Well uh, there’s one more thing. Uhh, uh it’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she’s never seen a naked man who wasn’t Jewish. So… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So…What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I’m saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Barmifsaed?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So to get this part you can’t be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But you told them you weren’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Unless!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Unless what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well I’m not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey! What’s up Mon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Have at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.  All right, turkey. Eh, that won’t work. Cheese?  That won’t work. Olive loaf?  I hope that won’t work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you makin’ him a sandwich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Phoebe and Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> We have to get her a present?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book!  We have a guest list!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Cassie?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content> It’s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>Ah yeah, sorry about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s okay. Come, come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah—No!!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried?  We’re probably too old to do that now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all of these freckles. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Cassie</speaker><content>It took you that long to figure it out, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I’m, I’m a little slow.  Just as our children would be.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Who the hell are all these people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Phoebe and Rachel</speaker><content> I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Excuse us for a minute.  You didn’t tell her to come?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You were supposed to tell her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna. </content></utterance>
