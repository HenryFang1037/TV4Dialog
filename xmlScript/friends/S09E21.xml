<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why do you care so much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm gonna get some more coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> So, a professor, uh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious .  That's not how she used it...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content> I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I know the type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh... then I overpaid. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, what's this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you wanna go hunting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I would like to have the option!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> What's up?  Hey, Rachel!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And she wants to go hunting, too!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't care about any of that!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, do you care about friendship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Promise?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We really need to take those tests?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But I don't wanna do it in a cup!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's weird! In a doctor's office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I cannot believe Ross told you that! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> OH!</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Now, do you have any idea what you just said?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Phonetically? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow. What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along!  Janice! You're not... gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, Ja! Ja!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Phoebe!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know it's me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How can you come here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How could you not tell me you worked here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't have to tell you everything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Tips not included.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Good for you Pheebs!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Respectfully, professor R. Geller.  Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, how was the Met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>The museum was amazing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>No, we went to the left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yeah, it's fun .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess that's true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That was going to be my next argument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You're ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yeah, let's go.   Thanks Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Glad I could help man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but...  I made it work.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Actually it's both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh... what does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
