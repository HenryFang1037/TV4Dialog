</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>…and that was all before 10 o’clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We’re not gonna be…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Well, up yours too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chicken Kiev?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella.  So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you’ll ever see. I mean it’s over…  Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh. Oh. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>How’s it gonna be all right?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh, I see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They torn it down a few days early.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen. Hey!  Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really? To what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>To Put the Camera Away!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, you are Westminster Crabby. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh. Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, no. Oh, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I have a wedgie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, that is all you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So-so, what do you want for lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Still in love with?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m not in love with Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We thought you knew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You all know? Does Ross know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>The Vendor</speaker><content>So, what are you guys in the market for? We’ve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I don’t have to buy that, "I’m with stupid" T-shirt anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I like it. Here you go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I embarrass you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>The Vendor</speaker><content>He’s just jealous. You’ll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>The Vendor</speaker><content> They’re all tourists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>The Vendor</speaker><content>Good choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! </content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>We don’t have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She said what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>She said, "If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn’t right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Don’t you point your pants at me!  We have no choice! Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Ross don’t you understand? This is our wedding I’m talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>So what are you saying? It’s now or never?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. I’m saying it’s now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Or?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>It’s not the pants. It’s you that is backwards. And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Manhattan does not have enough stores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I think I can help you get over him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You can?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Um-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And a small piece of chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And a glass of tepid water. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here.  Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So uh, now look at the picture…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, and umm… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, how do you feel now?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She said that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know. A month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top.  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sometimes we were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That was pretty intense huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I hope he did!</content></utterance>
