<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I tried, but apparently singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How do you think she's doing?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Lima.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox".  Oh god! Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>What, is he your pet rat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. </content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Hello</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an apology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Is this your first apology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Heather</speaker><content>Good morning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hello.  But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ...  I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I was giving you an apology and you were totally checking her out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Huh. What's Tag's last name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>But it was a deap meaningful relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>It was Jones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>You mean, when you were a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Would you stop staring at her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I wasn't staring. I was leering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Bye</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>I think it's sweet. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you, a child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine. </content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey Mikey</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey P</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Setting rat traps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>To kill Bob??</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>No, no, to test his neck strength.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possum and a wisecracking owl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Bob! Robert!  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Better think of a new name for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my god, we killed Bob!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Suzie? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Seriously dude, 3 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don't trust him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Picturing that tree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I am, yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where you going, Joe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>For a walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh. You mind if I join you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Your thoughts? Plural?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Great novels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine ... mediocre porn</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Gavin Mitchelle's office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone!  Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.  Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Rach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ready for your birthday lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleague and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Pleased to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You were just being so nice to him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Right there! That was so fake!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Shh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Does he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, ok, thank you.  Do you see what all the guys see in her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh ...  Happy birth ...  oh, see you later </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, give me! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah. We have rat babies now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So this is what a stroke feels like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We have to stop them before something happens!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>So where did you study?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I didn't go to college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>No, where did you study acting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Molly ... people don't study acting ...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Sure, I'll go check on Emma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross and Chandler</speaker><content>Come on! Joe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Hi, is Molly here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, come on in. Molly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You must think I'm crazy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't told you about that yet, have I?</content></utterance>
