<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So why don’t you quit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Who is Maria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>MrTreeger</speaker><content>Tribbiani! Hold on, I’ll get the plunger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>MrTreeger</speaker><content>And tell him what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>MrTreeger</speaker><content>Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I have actually not heard of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>MrTreeger</speaker><content>Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief. I’m gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother’s apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So do them for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>They make you take an oath?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t what your talking about. </content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! My hero! What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What a minute, what did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! You got us evicted!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I told you not to go down there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well he made Rachel cry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel always cries!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s not true! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Go!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, all right, all right.  I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it. </content></utterance>
