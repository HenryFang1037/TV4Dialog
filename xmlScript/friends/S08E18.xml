<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, who’s the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who said that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I’d really like to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they’ll say this year? "God, you"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.  I’m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really you can do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I can’t do it with you guys watching me!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s a dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The good stuff, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You got a present for my parents. That’s so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Aww that is so cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>No, no, no wait! Don’t tell me. Let me guess.  Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I’m sorry Phoebe didn’t mention you.  Chandler, I’m kidding all ready you’re my favorite!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Why don’t all of you tell me a little about your self?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, actually, I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content> Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I, uh, think you already are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than—Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where’s the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber’s Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin was born in Massapequa.}</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I got my note cards.  Do you got the presents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And I’ve got the car keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>We’re driving!?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Aces!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So uh, he seems like a nice guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Mr. and Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Hi</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi!  Hey mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Jack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmmm….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content> Congratulations you two!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you…we’re so excited</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>And also, congratulations on your wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wha—What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Can we talk to you for just a y’know… It’s just a little thing. Well we think it’s absolutely marvelous that you’re having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we’ve told them all that you’re married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Ross and Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Thanks for going along with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Can you believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, us having to lie about being married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party, and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Aunt Lisa</speaker><content>Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Ross and Rachel</speaker><content>Hmmmm….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Uncle Dan</speaker><content>Here’s a little something to get you started. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Aunt Lisa</speaker><content>So, how’s married life treating you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Unbelievable!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We love marriage!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Aunt Lisa</speaker><content>Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C…I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don’t want to forget this moment! It’s like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t think the flash went off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Dahaaa!  I’m going to find the men’s room, be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’ll go with you</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting my thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture!  Ooh sorry…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Were you guys making fun of Parker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That depends, how much did you hear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s just that, it’s so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I feel terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What was wrong with Mona?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Open it! Open it! Open it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>So we never got to hear about your wedding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>We were surprise that we weren’t invited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Where did you have it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm…. what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>And I’m with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing.  What an inspired solution to man’s plate dispensing problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hm huh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, that’s not necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, actually I don’t eat…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>I won’t quit until you try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, fine! Fine!  Mmm…hmmmmm….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>What are they like? I’ve never had one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why don’t you just try one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>No, they look too weird.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you doin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Blind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Aunt Lisa</speaker><content>I’ll bet you looked beautiful…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content> So, how did you propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah. That’s a great story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Aunt Lisa</speaker><content>Oh that is so sweet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Shhh! I want to hear the rest!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And the ring, was the size of my fist !</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Then you better do it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because I’m going to kill him</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What-what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What’s that now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nothing…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh look it’s Parker!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Look! It’s the bunny hop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oooh I love it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>You do?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you.  When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was.  Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment?  Didn’t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love.  You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn’t it interesting, Jack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content> Why don’t I remember this dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Ross, why don’t you give us your toast now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>You’re not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content> Oh Ross…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross’s toast.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>It’s a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>That sounds great.  My God this is the most comfortable couch I’ve ever sat on in my entire life. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>I love games!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Or…Jenga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>I lose, now Jenga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God! Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Is something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>I’m sorry that’s who I am. I’m a positive person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Much less happy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I’d better be going."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Parker</speaker><content>Isn’t this the most incredible fight you’ve ever had in your entire life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh huh. </content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>…and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It was really fun being married to you tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That proposal, at the planetarium…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know, I know it was stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Goodnight</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I will think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s all I’m askin’</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?</content></utterance>
