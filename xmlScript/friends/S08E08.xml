<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no, no, I’ll be there too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh. Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! Oh well, I will be there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.  Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> No you don’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> No you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Her what?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Your secret bachelorette party…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You had a bachelorette party?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She untied his G-string with her teeth.  Somebody stop me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s a grand tradition!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You went home with the waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>It’s chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t eat that either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>I’ll never understand you lesbians.  So baby, tell me…what is new with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well actually umm…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>’74?! I ordered the ’75! That’s a magnificent wine! The ’74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?!  Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you’re a waiter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>This is why I told the manager I wouldn’t wait on you tonight! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why, so he can get mad at the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, that is the…baby’s problem.  Oh, everything okay with the waiter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well… Umm, I got TiVo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>What’s TiVo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It’s slang for pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>Are you really pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>Who is the father? Oh no! Please don’t tell me it’s her! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross.  Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>That’s true.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y’know take it all in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, a lot of my students do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>So, I gotta get going.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>My God! You must be good in bed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, it’s good. It’s going good. I mean, we get along great. She’s, she’s so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off, y’know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Will you let the lady talk?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>I just called a friend of mine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>What is it sweetie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m sorry daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>I don’t believe this!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won’t marry you?! That’s it! Is that it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You’re right, this is more fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s her! Okay, come on! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Stripper</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That was weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why-why would she go in the bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Stripper</speaker><content>I’m waiting.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>I love your place! Where is this guy from? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh wow! So, you’re more than just dinosaurs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So much more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh my God! Oh my God! I’m so sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One.  Sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I’m gonna kill you!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>You got Rachel pregnant?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Who did?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>You did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey! I offered to marry her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Wh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> But I didn’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Tramp?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Ma’am, are you also a stripper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Hooker</speaker><content>Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that’s gonna cost extra. Okay, here’s the extras, handcuffs, spanking… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Hooker</speaker><content>Do you mind if I smoke in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>How could you have kept all of this from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I was going to tell you, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Dr. Green</speaker><content>But what?! You figured you’d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Stu</speaker><content>So, tonight’s the night of the big bachelor party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Stu</speaker><content>No problem. So who’s the party for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>My husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Stu</speaker><content>You hired your husband a hooker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She’s a stripper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Stu</speaker><content>No, she’s a hooker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Stu</speaker><content>When they’re hookers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Stu</speaker><content>Either that or she’s just the best, most expensive date I ever had.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why would she do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is the worst bachelor party ever!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Hooker</speaker><content>What’s taking you boys so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>In a minute!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! It’s your bachelor party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Which is why you should do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t want to. You do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I miss this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.</content></utterance>
