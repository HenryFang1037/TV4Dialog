<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Did you see our bank statement? Could this be right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm not sure what they did...but I'm inclined to blame .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I guess with you doing the internship, we're spending more than we're bringing in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh...But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was...y'know...finding gold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month. And maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refridgerator for a change. You're a chef...what can you make out of baking soda and beer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! We're not borrowing money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was...well to always knock before going into the poolhouse...But the other thing was...never borrow money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! I had no idea you had this much pride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I'm gonna go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get somemore clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh...you don't have to go...I have something that will fit you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I put that tube top on as a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I want you to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I want to stay too but I've got about as much out of these boxers as I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why don't you turn them inside out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Done it.  I'll be back in a couple of hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'll miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Me too. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You know what? I just realized something. I don't wanna go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>No, no! What I mean is...I hate going back to my apartment now...And partly because I live above a known crack den but...mostly because when I'm there...It's just...i really miss you. So...Do you want to move in together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow...Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>So we're doing it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you will never get back to Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself...Chandler is my best friend...It would be wrong. Good. ...But wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>: Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Awww...I don't know Monica...You know...erm...lending friends money is always a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But Chandler lent you money!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on...I just need it for some rent and...and some other bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh...how much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Two thousand dollars?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi you guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oo...what's in the bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh er...well you know Emma started crawling? I realized that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh...baby-proofing...Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know...when I was a kid it was like... "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er... "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Anyway erm...Are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. I was just going to do this myself. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You're gonna do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah...Why? You don't think a woman can do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh...Women can. You...can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're a pig. And you can't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>The hardware store is right down the street.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like".</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes dear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's...that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I hear wedding bells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean...I don't know...Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah...You know...I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know...near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior... Oh my god I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe...I had no idea you were so conventional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! You bet roomy!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Listen er...I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And that would have made the official party line.  Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah...I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What? What do you mean you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>ER...I just figured it out! You know...I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh! Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Anyway, er... I need to borrow some money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Er...Well I...Know how much you used to make...And I know how much your rent is. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Er...Kind of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh no no no no no...It wasn't...It wasn't because of your money problems...It was for something...for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Something personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Boob job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well it's...It's not THAT crazy. ok? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Well hey...I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...Maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together. You're not expecting a proposal...right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah well...that's the thing. For me it's...as far as it can ever go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Look. Phoebe...I...I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh. Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>It's just my first marriage was...you know... such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Was it really that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok...well that's bad...But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But it's just.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Look Phoebe...It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in...and you start changing your mind...there's gonna be hell to pay mister!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Trust me...I will never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah I get that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no...don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not...TWO...single things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok...you're being weird. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No no! I just love the way you look... I am warm...for your form.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok...You know the old classics, you know, "You look nice"? They're still ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well yes yes...You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your BODY. I mean...I wouldn't change it...At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>o...k.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I mean...You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know, why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know! I mean...what brought that on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No...you really think that's what it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger...Your ass is gonna get bigger...You're gonna lose bladder control.  God! It's just such a magical time!</content></utterance>
