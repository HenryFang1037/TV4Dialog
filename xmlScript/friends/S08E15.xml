<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages?  Oh, thank you. I’ll see you guys later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks. But maybe later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content> You want anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>We have red bagels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, I’m going to take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right.  ‘Candy and Cookie?’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Phoebe, c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, Monica, grow up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, what’s behind your back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You don’t want my opinion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, big brother.  Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> The red one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He-hee!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks so much, Pheebs!  We are going to have so much fun, yes we are!  Oh! Not that kind of fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Happy Valentine’s!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> ‘Candy and Cookie’. ‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Man on TV</speaker><content>Yeah, just relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I love you, St. Valentine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Man on TV</speaker><content>Now, push!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Woman on TV</speaker><content>Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Woman on TV</speaker><content>Ohhh! Make it stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am trying!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball!  Well, you’re cute, but you’re not too smart!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Did I just throw this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I accidentally packed these with my stuff.  Who is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do.  Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can’t stop it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’s the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But we can’t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You’re a guy.  Well, you used to be.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> So what do you think? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I’ve still got it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Why did you get me this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’s Day…  you were right! Apparently, it’s about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts!  Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How long it took to go back in the water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t know. You didn’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See, honey, there’s—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don’t touch me!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!  So, how was Atlantic City?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>I brought you back a present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>I think it’s interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I do too! I missed you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>I missed you, too! So, how was your week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>How exciting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content> Yeah right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Joey cracks me up! It’s like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn’t be awkward at all!’ </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Huh…uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>So, what’d you tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Just a second! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ever?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff?  Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What’s the deal?  Oh, it’s nice! May I try a pink one?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog?  You’re subdued.  Did you give him a beer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. Go ahead.  Oh, me, right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He’s miserable! What happened to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nothing. We just talked about stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Rachel stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He’s breathing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look!  Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball!  Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine’s dinner! Surprise!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ayyyayyyy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, hey, Mona!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel!  What’s she doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I have no idea!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Seriously, what is she doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think she’s lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Okay, but it’s Valentine’s Day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Can’t we just ask her to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>You got another ex-wife back there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Please start drinking! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I’m just going to grab the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but, but, um… what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don’t you go back to your place and give us some privacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> But, but, Mona, I live here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How long has it been this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>90 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, thank God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Poor Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why? You saw it? Is it scary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay, here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.  Ooh, my!  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why have I seen this thing three times?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s…still beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh! It’s horrible!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait, you guys, look!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Did her ass explode?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, the baby’s out! Look, look!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And look how happy the mom is now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh…Rach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, hey, man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh…Mona just dumped me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sort of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You don’t have to seem so happy about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I…I d—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actually once—once I got dumped during sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Forget about it. It’s no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>C’mon! Joey! What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, uh…sit down.  Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She’s not a Tribbiani?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I knew it. So, is she someone from work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, uh, does she like you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay. Um… is he a good guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-37"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content> Here’s your warm milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-39"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s Rachel.</content></utterance>
