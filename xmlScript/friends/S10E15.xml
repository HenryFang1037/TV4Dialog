<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Or facing a bitch of a commute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, we'll work it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you! Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, great! All right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's in Paris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Of course we can. Congratulations.  Yay!  Joey...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Joey, it would mean so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You okay with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it makes me feel sad, but...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Talking to Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How is that gonna happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I didn't say we were brothers.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What do you think Pheebs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You're kidding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's terrible!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, she was just an agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey's gonna be *so* upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What if he reads it in the paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>May I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>Oh right, uhm, Don?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Close. Ron. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>Uh... What can I do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>Wow, that is tempting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>She is good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Huh, I took a shot there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>Yeah, his name is Ross.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>You can really arrange that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>That’s great. I worry about little Ross. He’s always reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey. Everything ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m just mad at my agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Estelle? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m guessing she does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well  I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I love that saying!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, actually I am!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m saying that… . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Man, tough week for Estelle!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nooo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, you’re not going to Paris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I’m still going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wh… wh…what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeeeah! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Lady</speaker><content>Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Lady</speaker><content>So? What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Love it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Lady</speaker><content>Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They could be our neighbors, what are they like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Lady</speaker><content>Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You blow me away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>What a small world!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And yet I never run into Beyonce!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Realtor</speaker><content>You two know each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Don't, don't! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, actually, we're buying the house next door. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Why!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I don't know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!  Ellen, we're going to talk numbers. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This can not be happening!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, Okay,  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, you come up with an idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But we love our house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>r Zelner</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> It's me. Ron.  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content> Not good, Ron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content> Wow, that's pretty cool </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh? So? We have a deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>Okay, you got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes! yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content>This is gonna make me very popular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Mr Zelner</speaker><content> I meant with my son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor. </content></utterance>
