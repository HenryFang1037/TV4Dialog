You’re better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey, it’s your girlfriend, Rachel!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you, are you high?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I just had the most amazing bath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? I don’t like baths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait, you like them with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, baths are so relaxing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh my God, what’s up?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately, I’ve been feeling… Okay, here’s what it is…  You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>In London?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And smart!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Popular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>With an aptitude for science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really? Me too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Me too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay fine, what do you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, by Sandrine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m really, really not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How-how about you each get five vetoes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That sounds fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Veto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, why do you hate our child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine, you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, James.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But only if it’s a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Veto. Stewart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Veto. Sawyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Veto. Helen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Veto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Boy, do I have a surprise for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sex on the balcony?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I drew you a bath!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, this does butch it up a bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I swear, if you try it, you will love it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m going to need a bigger boat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, no. No, we’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>That’s right. But if you don’t want to know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, we want to wait, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right. Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content> Oh, I’ll be right back. And, uh, I know it’s really not my place, but please don’t name your child Phoebo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Third one from the left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it.  Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’re looking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I didn’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I saw you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, but Ross just listen to me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m in the bathtub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh.  What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.  It’s interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, let’s talk about something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I had the exact same conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You did? What was he talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> That was a long night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, he was talking about rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Umm, and looking at people differently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He didn’t say anything about that to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What did he tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But what did he mean by rules?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because he was looking at her differently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> You guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Just a minute!  That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m not going to let you say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You just stay here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, you had that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, just as well, I broke this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s a humdinger!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Somebody likes you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-49"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Is it Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-50"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-51"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, then tell him to stop staring!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-52"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-53"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-54"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is it something you’d be interested in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-55"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-56"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-57"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-58"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Not Chandler, just Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-59"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I would—Sequoia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Veto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Unless…  You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But Ross, you want the name Ruth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not like this!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey. Well, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, Joey, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I knooow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whaaat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know about your feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my God. You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>For God sakes, it’s Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah that’s Rachel.  Beat me over the head with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.</content></utterance>
