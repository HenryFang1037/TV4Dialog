By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>"When can you move in?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you for bringing her into our lives.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You a little sad about that sweetheart?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Mon, how's it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, I've been married 3 times</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's not specific to girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>This is great, this is great, what else, what else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I'm never gonna find love again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, what should you have done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I-I should've told you the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-Huh, Which is...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why do you care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because they're people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But people that you don't know and will never see again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbor's dog.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why does anyone have to be naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why is Ross naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I-I had to show Chandler something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is it the same thing that Chandler had?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.</content></utterance>
