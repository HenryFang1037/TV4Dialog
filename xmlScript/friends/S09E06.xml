<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>This is nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You need both hands for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I kinda do.  Well, how's this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?  Have you not talked about it yet?  Am I making you uncomfortable?  If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Maybe not, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this...  No, not... that's gum.  Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh, sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>It's to my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no, I want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh, thank God. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Is this cool, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It really is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Nanny Candidate</speaker><content> I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Nanny Candidate</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right. Well thank you so much for coming... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Nanny Candidate</speaker><content>Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question.  Do you guys do random drug testing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Nanny Candidate</speaker><content>That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What, the blonde with no bra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content> Hi... I'm Sandy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And she's a little mannish...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh my God! David!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Who cares, it got you here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow. Where is your luggage? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Damn it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>A-All right, well... I'll call the cab company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are.  Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe he didn't give you a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, well... That had been your window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really? The scientist guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really? Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Continue...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know!  Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You have to tell David!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Funniest guy she's ever met!  I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes...  Save it for inside! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Heeeeeey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Was your cabin pressurised?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, he came up...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Were you there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sandy, that's exactly what it is...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you gay? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Her name is Deliah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that's pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...  That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because, it's weird!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>King?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... it keeps the hands young... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Please?  YES! Sandy you're hired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>That's great!  I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oooh... wow, come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You gotta be at least bi...</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know, right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Seriously? She actually said that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Without that, you just got "lame with women".</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, it's not that.  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Oh... oh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I should have told you.</content></utterance>

Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>David</speaker><content>No... no...</content></utterance>
