<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes I do!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>The Girls</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I don’t know.  What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Who got married?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-54"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hell, I’m drunk right now!  What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-55"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you guys gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-56"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-57"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-58"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-59"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-60"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh-oh, that’s your thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-61"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-62"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-63"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-64"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-65"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.  I’m so drunk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, what do you think we should do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know I love you! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sounds great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Croupler</speaker><content>Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ready!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Come on eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yes, yes eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Croupler</speaker><content>Eight! Easy eight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.  We’re doing the right thing, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh, of course we are!  We left it up to fate.  If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any  QUESTIONS!!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m asking you to do me a favor.</content></utterance>
