<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, you said that without gagging!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come on, give me something. What's his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Mike.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey and Phoebe</speaker><content> </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said...  There's no guy in there!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know what she's talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross said he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He saw a therapist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why? What was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That I was going to eat him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>MIKE!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Okay! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I am Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Atta boy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, look...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Everyone</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> From school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah, we met in college.  I mean, high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Well, I'm a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Mike, 'attorney at law'!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Actually, I just gave up my practice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Mary Ellen</speaker><content>I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's so sweet. Find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Slim Pickings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nothing, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>'So Cheesy' also has an opening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Dr. Gettleman</speaker><content> I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Dr. Gettleman</speaker><content>Would you like a lollypop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You even have to ask?!    He is alive!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>No, I didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Please, we're trying to have a conversation. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Mary Ellen</speaker><content>Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Do you not know each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games.  Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> Six!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What are you doing? I said seven!   Argh!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Mary Ellen</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Who are you kidding?  You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm out of here </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>It was nice meeting you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You're leaving too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Mary Ellen</speaker><content>I'll stay if you can tell me my name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Good night!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're right.  Maybe I shouldn't go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo. It's just a little outside of Tulsa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How far outside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Manhattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And you're thinking of taking it?  So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job,  me,  new job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think you should take the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How was the pediatrician?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I really liked him.  Yeah, it was really, really, really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You promised you wouldn't say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know.  Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!  I don't care!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He's a brilliant diagnostician!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?</content></utterance>
