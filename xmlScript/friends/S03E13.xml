<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>You’ve got panties stuck to your leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>It’s good to see you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And what are you going to do for him?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah well, I ran into Richard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>When did this happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, are you gonna see him again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We’re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Naked friends.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Do you have any ice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmm.  Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How often do you read it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining,  and you will read Little Women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, you got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Exactly. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right I’ll talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hmmm, that’s very cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. She doesn’t die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Then why would you say that?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Well, you seem fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom....  Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>You mean like exclusive friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together.

<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Richard</speaker><content>Wow. Y'know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed.</content></utterance>
