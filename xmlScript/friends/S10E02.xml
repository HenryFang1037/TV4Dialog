<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We weren't doing anything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Rach, he just saw us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Shhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We feel so terrible about this, Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, but it did happen, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Probably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, but you know what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,  I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's all working out! Me  Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Calm ourselves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I do like fajitas.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>There's a hair in my coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's sweet. Drink your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, what's all this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's not really how it works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, how does it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>That's not what we talked about!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Good to see you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Hi, how you doin'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Which one is which again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, what would we be doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Feel me up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>In a carriage!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, Charlie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, did you bring a little something for Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.  And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.  I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know.  Come, please come in. Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, well, we brought you some wine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh! That is so thoughtful.  She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, actually, that's..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>I haven't slept in four years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's a, that's a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>No, I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>Oh, please, we're happy to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>We went through the same thing when we were adopting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I mean, you have a lovely home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>Well, actually, I think this might help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>It's pretty much all the information you need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's great.  Can I see the book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's.. It's just so pretty and white.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>I would have told him to do it too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Can I adopt you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, you must be Owen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>You were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know how to use a compass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>I have a badge in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You do? That's fantastic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>You wanna see it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>What?!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>I'm adopted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I got nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No awareness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>My fajitas!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That is gonna hurt tomorrow!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>No, of course we're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Alice would never go for it, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Frank Jr.Jr.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog!  Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Alright, so that leaves Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>How about tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Frank Jr.</speaker><content>You'd do that for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where are Bill and Colleen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We have to leave!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why? What did you do in the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>I'm adopted?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See? Intuitive!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Bill</speaker><content>What? Where did you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Which technically now you should give back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Colleen</speaker><content>You told him he's adopted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Owen</speaker><content>He isn't?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-46"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-47"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-49"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, you don't seem okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-50"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-51"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-52"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-53"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-54"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-55"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-57"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-58"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-59"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-60"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-61"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-62"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-63"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, no, it's just that it's getting late...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-64"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-65"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't even know what that's for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-66"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-68"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-69"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks. Did you stay here all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So you took off my pants and shoes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's what I hear, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm crazy about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And she feels the same way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And we're okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Still, he had to find out sometime.</content></utterance>
