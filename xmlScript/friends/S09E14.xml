<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Morning, roomy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fifth day's a charm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Raych, when will we expect to see you tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, hey, it's been great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, that'll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow! So, how are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm, I'm okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, actually it...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure, I know lots of girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah? Any names come to mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh, names?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why are they doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I just wish they'd realize they should be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realize how good they are for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. ... Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realize how good they are together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh, that's a great plan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why? What's the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, it's perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right! Who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>A teacher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my god, you're right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>She even reads for pleasure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How do you even know a woman like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I met her at the library. I went in to pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So now what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh...I hear that's bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realize how good they have it together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah, yes, The Plan! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I think we killed it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Today is the sixth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, it's also 2003.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Tough crib.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am not working. There's not much to do around here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Can I get you another glass of wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Got stood up, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're okay. I'm still ovulating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, let's do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I - I don't think I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because of Emma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Canoodling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I guess you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content> I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>I'm kind of funny looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>I lost it. To drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>I silk-screen t-shirts now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really? What's that like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>I do like my hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, Raych!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>He's not stoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Did he go out for a cigarette?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, four times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My dear, sweet Raych.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico....Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She's asleep. Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Emma was doing it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She's asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes, but we have to be fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, I'll try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Emma? Hey! Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Ooh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Just the crab cakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Just get out of here, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What's - what's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? You - you're making money off my misery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think we may have really done it this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You may wanna get some more of those too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where's Emma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why does everyone keep saying that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.</content></utterance>
