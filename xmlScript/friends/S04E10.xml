<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>15?  Your personal best! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, which museum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> No, answer his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Were you so late because you were burring this woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? </content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, look at this!  They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody!  Y’know, I want a man!!  I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What’s wrong Mon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this  on my chef’s hat. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, honey! What’s the matter?  Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Good enough to get fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, you’re hired!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now?  Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Drew</speaker><content>I didn’t think you were gay. I do now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Drew</speaker><content>Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh, by the way, that is her full name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh wow! I’m free for her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Drew</speaker><content>Oh, wait a second! I didn’t say I wasn’t free!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Drew</speaker><content>Hold on, y’know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah! With who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, man!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You got it! Oh-oh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you doing?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, like father, like son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ummmmmmmm, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>A Waiter</speaker><content> Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>The Waiter</speaker><content>Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>The Waiter</speaker><content>Because we can remember them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>The Waiter</speaker><content>Well, sure, that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>The Waiter</speaker><content>Can’t hear you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here.  From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!!  Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No ma’am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>The Waiter</speaker><content>Hey! He has a name, it’s Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat.  We did the hat right? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What the hell happened?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It’s been a long time since I had…  327 + 238 dollars!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What kinda things have you been saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Bad dream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I wasn’t sleeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, did you pick one yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Prague?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>There’s sooo much you don’t know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I did! I absolutely did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You idiot!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m sure you’re right, but why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well that sounds fun too. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Have you ever been with a woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!</content></utterance>
