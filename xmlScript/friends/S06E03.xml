<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>…how about I move in with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Who’s Denise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You have a roommate?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, Denise. Denise!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You didn’t tell her did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Of course not, because you’re in love with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What do you mean, comforted her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s also a sign of friendship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> It was a hug!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, that’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What do you have against the beautiful guest room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you mocking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh?  Not just a hat rack my friend!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pheebs, I have to ask you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You’re just staring into space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>This one? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It worked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait, no, look at this!   "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…" Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here’s Warren’s number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, you go grab it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I saw it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, I do not re-love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can’t believe you won’t just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You can live with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! Are you serious?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh please!   You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me!   Okay, that’s a lie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! Oh yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Totally!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We don’t have to come up with this now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Changes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is that a problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>In the game room!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>The Potential Roommate</speaker><content>Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I’ll be living here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why did you take the shower curtain down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That thing was a hazard!  I’m very safety conscious.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! Over a stupid room!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, we can handle this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Love is the best medicine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s laughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why do you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>So I understand you’re looking for a place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No-no, I’m staying put.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why, where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey Rach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, because of us! Because of our history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! Not at all!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really?! We are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ohh! That would be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky." </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah, I didn’t think of that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s very funny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!</content></utterance>
