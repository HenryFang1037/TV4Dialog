<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?! They took mine to give to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why would they take away our keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe they don’t trust us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I washed those!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I have stuff in there too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it.  Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency.  Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Did Rachel find you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh she was looking for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, it seemed pretty important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think I might know what this is about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh sorry.  And?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why? What-what else could it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh wow, I don’t feel well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Maybe it’s something you ate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess I should.  Man, y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? Oh yeah.  I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I  really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!</content></utterance>
