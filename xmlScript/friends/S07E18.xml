<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Lewis</speaker><content>What kinda noise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Just a high pitched intimidating noise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Lewis</speaker><content>But like how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this.  Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all for today.  Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Morse</speaker><content>I’m in love with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well that brings me in the loop a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Morse</speaker><content>You see, that’s why I did so bad on this test. I’m having a hard time concentrating. When you’re up there  and you’re teaching and your face gets all serious…you look so good.  You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay!  Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’m sorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>The Cute Guy</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>The Cute Guy</speaker><content>Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well you should be embarrassed. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>The Cute Guy</speaker><content> I thought you knew I was looking at you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> All I could think of was y’know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And did he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You sound like a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, a guy would be saying, "I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’ll have a last kiss.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Not right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How’d you get over that teacher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I didn’t. I got under him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling…</content></utterance>
