<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>For all the free food you gave away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’s birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!  This is my "Please, hire me" sweater.  And these are my, "Don’t you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>So who made her queen of the world?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Right! But, I am sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena.  And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away, ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah, how about you and the,  "I’m sorry!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content> Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Come on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>With Ross and Jill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh there is no way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant.</content></utterance>
