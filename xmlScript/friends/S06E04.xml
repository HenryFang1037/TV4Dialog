<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ohh! Okay! Okay.  "There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into…"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why don’t you open with a joke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> "Benefits lapsed."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Let me see that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pheebs, what-what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I loved them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.  Nice try! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That you’re not funny or sexy?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Estelle</speaker><content>All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Estelle</speaker><content>Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s a hernia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Hey sisters!   Wow, we really are bitches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when— Oh bloody hell.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn’t hurt that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! Maybe you’ll die!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure, now I’m scared.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!</content></utterance>
