<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>The Director</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>The Director</speaker><content>Look Joey, there’s nothing I can do. Besides, you’re probably gonna be out by four anyway. We’ve just got one short scene. It’s just you and Richard, and God knows he’s a pro. You’ll be fine.  Morning Richard.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What’s wrong with being the Bings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?</content></utterance>

And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well yeah, but then…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> That’s my line!  I can take it from here, thanks.  Dearly beloved, I’m sorry I’m a little late. You may be confused by this now,  but you won’t be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let’s get started before the groom takes off again. Huh?  We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I’ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> He took off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Go on! Go on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> No, that’s okay.  Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I didn’t take a pregnancy test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Then…who did?</content></utterance>
