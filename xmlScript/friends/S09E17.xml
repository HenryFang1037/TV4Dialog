<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You're not gonna need my help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, you got it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really? If that's what you want...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That was a test and you just failed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Damn it! Rookie mistake!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I have sex with dinosaurs??</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I believe I read that somewhere!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I respectfully disagree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who cares? Nobody reads those things</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't have a page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.  It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> There you go sweetie...  This isn't over.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  "gay as the day is long"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie!  I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, you'll see my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I'm dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> And so young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, how you died was funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh please, hit by a blimp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It kills over one americans every year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>God, I wish Mike were here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.  Give me your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And now your cell.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, no! Give it to me!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Give it to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Make the transfer! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But he's the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Haha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Those are my shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Who's that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I ordered Chinese food.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> This doesn't concern you!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend  and Mike's friend .</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So how's the piano playing going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I've missed you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>uhu uhu, check this out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, come on, you know that's not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Exactly!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>... she's being unreasonable!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much  Oh don't cover its ears!  It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really? She... she loves me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How do you think I got him in the first place?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Kiss him, you fool!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You are married though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-37"><speaker>Kori</speaker><content>I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I didn't know Ross and you were so close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-39"><speaker>Kori</speaker><content>We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Kori</speaker><content>I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-43"><speaker>Kori</speaker><content>You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-44"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!</content></utterance>
