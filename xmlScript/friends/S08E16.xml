<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s Rachel.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what? I-I gotta go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Whoa!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow that was a big one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh hey you guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh,  and you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well last night, I met Monica’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Come on, don’t be crazy.  You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Well, what’s he like?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well he’s tall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He has brown hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Of course, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He works with food!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh sure. Older?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Obviously, and he’s British.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I was just gonna ask!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He’s not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him.  It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Oh, hello.  Hello. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Soul mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Soul mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, what have you guys been doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know! What is this, 1985?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>That’s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn’t that strange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Well, Octavio, 277—Oh! And there’s this great little place, Alessandro’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>You’re kidding me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you doing?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Phoebe, good work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I don’t want to hit you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh what then? Kick me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Bite me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh…yeah sure. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! You’re in love with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I thought you knew that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Umm, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I’ll get over this." Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think you need to tell her how you feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, tell me about it. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>…so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>And you’re still married to him? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries…  And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is it made of cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Don</speaker><content>No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’d move in tomorrow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight.  Take a couple deep breaths.  Look confident. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey? What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Here? In the hall? What are we animals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah.  Don’t you people ever knock?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Jeez! What is with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m sorry, did you say cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. But I’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t believe in soul mates either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>…and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.  Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…—Is it hot in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. Sure. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh… How long have we known each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh-huh, long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But over the past few weeks…</content></utterance>
