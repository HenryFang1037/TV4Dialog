<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling.  Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt.  My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy...  Cats....like....fish!   Hi, Mommy.

<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, you and I went to different high schools...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> They had to have that specially made?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you go out with him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, really?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced.  Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo.  Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why can’t you use the phone in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, don’t start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No you do--y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I do not always have to be--okay, okay. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Tony</speaker><content>You gotta take the canoe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Peter</speaker><content>We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?  Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m sorry, sweetie. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No! Look--Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ross, how many parents have you lost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I think she would like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Thank you. We both forgive you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’ll go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-38"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Me too. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon.</content></utterance>
