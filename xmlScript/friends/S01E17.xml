<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, we can go to Williamsburg.</content></utterance>
