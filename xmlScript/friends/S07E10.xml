<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No reason, except…she…told…me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You're sure? You're absolutely sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word.  Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves!  In this world history teaches us nothing! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is this because of the burrito thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> You need to give him money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Give him money? It was a joke!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You've got to be smooth about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, I can be smooth.  Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content> Jingle bells, jingle bells...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How do you know so much about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Richard used to do it, didn't he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We'd be eating our soup right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Mustached bastard…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Rachel and Joey</speaker><content>Tequila!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's fun. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe on some level.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey, Joey, I got you another present. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's a…tarantula!  Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Our apartment is ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And that makes you angry because…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because you would rather live here with Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Where did you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Fish!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, it's so much more fun with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We did have fun, didn't we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I would love to!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yay, okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Good, good, good, good, good. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Um...  Done!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, these are my pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Salesman</speaker><content>Oh. Okay! How can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Texas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Wow! Thanks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> You are? Me, too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> You wanna wander in the hall?  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Santa! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you doing here, Santa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Did you bring me any presents, Santa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fine, I'll give the suit back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Santa? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes, is that okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Then it's okay! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-42"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>No! Why does he have to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-43"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-44"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-46"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-47"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Okay, Santa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-49"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Merry Christmas!</content></utterance>
