<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, all right, I'll play.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica and Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, no, you say that proudly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>To score the winning touchdown, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I won the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Um, there was a Geller Cup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And was the curse lifted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.</content></utterance>
