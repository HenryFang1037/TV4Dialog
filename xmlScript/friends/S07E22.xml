<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait a minute!  You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> You let Joey drive it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, "You can drive it, but don’t tell Rachel" plan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, you got a couple hours?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whew! That was a brisk ride!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Take the top down did ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Only way to fly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!  Give-give me a brush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Gimme the keys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well no brush!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Alimony. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Just washing the windshield. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!  Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>With you?! Yeah right!</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!!  We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know we already went over this and I won!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Does it matter?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So I really never get to win anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How much did ever really win before?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know. They were mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh.  No! No wait, that’s weird!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s weird!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m wearing his briefs right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s…kinda hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You’ve seen my huge stack of porn right? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-oh. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it.  Here we go.</content></utterance>
