<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I think on some levels she already knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, well maybe not on those levels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So how many more do you have tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh right, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.</content></utterance>
