<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I already have one.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh-huh, yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You could?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Your own boat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you know what I was thinkin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nothing, I just like to go like this. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh why, do you have a lecture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Then free as a bird. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, did-did you correct him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He hates to lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’re not a lefty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Does anybody know me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What’s wrong Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it Pheebs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No one got me an engagement present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>An old cookie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We can’t accept this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>‘Cause it’s gross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! I bet I can do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, we owe you a present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Two! I’ve been engaged twice!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.  Get out of the way jackass!  Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That is the Coast Guard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is!  Yo-ho-ho!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  what’s this called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, boat rope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhh, rub it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Time’s up, now your dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And deaf!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You don’t?  Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That and arrogance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! How was sailing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica and Phoebe</speaker><content>No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Women are mean!!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! How was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And what did he ask you not to call him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Daddy. All right look, here’s the story.  Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Over here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Have a seat son.  Hey!! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You gave my father a lap dance!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why do they put so much steam in there?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come on, it’s not that big a deal!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t want him to tell this story for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I wasn’t escaping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I was trying to help out a squirrel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You were trying to eat it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Come on.  Hello?  I’m sorry you have the wrong number.   Okay, I’ll call you later dad. I love you. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> All right, I’m off to see your dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Because! You’re mean on the boat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? I was just trying to teach you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You have to respect the sea! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You won’t boss me around anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I won’t boss you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And you’ll be nice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And, I’ll be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And you’ll be topless?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And—Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do you want me to learn?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Let’s give it a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, just a Friday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ohh, these are pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Which one was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The ones we had right after you almost threw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I’m okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh…  It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side.  Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohh yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know why you just don’t say left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, go to the left.  The left!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Just sit over there!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I?   Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, hey I did learn.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Damnit!</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Looking up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What was her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nesele Toulouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nestle Tollhouse?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Phoebe, is this the recipe? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yes!!  Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you’re burning in hell!!</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What did you do when they found out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh we’re not sailing.</content></utterance>
