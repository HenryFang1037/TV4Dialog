<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>Do you want a date Saturday?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah! Right!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yes. Absolutely. A quality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>What's different?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh, maybe that's it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She is unbelievable, our mother is...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Not just restaurants, from our house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Mrs. Geller?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She looks so small.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>G'bye, Nana. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Bye, Nana.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>What is going on?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She's not- past, she's present, she's back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Aunt Lillian</speaker><content> What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>She may have died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Aunt Lillian</speaker><content>She may have died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>We're looking into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I, uh, I'll go see. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>This almost never happens!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Now she's passed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you have homosexual hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, um, did she...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Twice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, that sucks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You guys okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nono, she's gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We checked. A lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?  Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Thanks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Sweetie, you think you can get in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I don't see why not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Here's my retainer!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I was just thinking. When my time comes-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Define fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's probably what they'll say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I'd like that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, gorgeous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content> Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>Oh! Okay! Phew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, uh... what do you think it is about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>...Quality, right, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>What? He's cute!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>Is Brian...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Shelley</speaker><content>Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> This one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Aunt Lillian</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Aunt Lillian</speaker><content>You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Aunt Lillian</speaker><content>Wait! We need shoes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay. Um, how about these? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>That's really a day shoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Aunt Lillian</speaker><content>Could we see something in a slimmer heel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Aunt Lillian</speaker><content>No, it really should be burgundy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Is everything all right, dear?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Some days it's all I can think about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you-you mean your earrings?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That sounds like Nana.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>...I can imagine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Tell her what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>More wine, dear?</content></utterance>
