<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do we have to know about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What, it's ok when Chandler does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You have to pick your moments.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>We stopped at the gift shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I used to have that bumper sticker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You see what I mean.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Dr. Franzblau</speaker><content>So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>59 seconds.  Quartz, ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Swiss quartz, ha, ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Am I allowed to drink anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Dr. Franzblau</speaker><content>Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah? When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why won't I be married when I'm 40?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Uh, uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, I haven't seen him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No reason. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>She's not much of a phone person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Dr. Franzblau</speaker><content>No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Dr. Franzblau</speaker><content>No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Dr. Franzblau</speaker><content>I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm a waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Dr. Franzblau</speaker><content>Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Lydia</speaker><content>I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.  This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This is so great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You wanna explain that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  I'm sorry, you were fighting.</content></utterance>
