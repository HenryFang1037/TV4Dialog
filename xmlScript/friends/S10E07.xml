<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's funny, we were doing the same thing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So what did you two do about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Maybe you do that next time you get married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset.  But maybe the time after that!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> We?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Little people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Celebrity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What...? NO!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It isn't mine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>May I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>Well, this is very generous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Not necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>It does. It feels really good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mhm... it's moist.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God, what!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Be-caaauuuse...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come on, you know, when you see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok, ok, here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hello, is this the creepy residence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you wanna use it, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party.  This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on?  And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant.  All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>City Hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ow!  Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But you already gave all your money to charity!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I'll just ask for it back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't think you can do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, she's got like three hairs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know  but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>See, I told you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, absolutely!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok!  See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly  Ow!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>We're seriously asking for our money back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that that's ever happened before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah! This feels really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Charity guy</speaker><content>Hey, it's not my business,  besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, that's not fair! A person's wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>She could have been talking about either one of us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Oh, water would be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Your place is just lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Oh...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really? What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Of course it was!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>RAT BASTARD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>So you're not friends with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Monica and Chandler</speaker><content>OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?  OW!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that  kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Why don't I show you the baby's room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, we're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We don't have a code word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So that was the baby's room. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> What room should we see next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Any room that isn't behind this couch! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I did not care for that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok, ok! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Are you friends with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can explain... Joey...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>I gave you my number, you never called me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content>Joey, wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>Laura</speaker><content> I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, that's really ok.</content></utterance>
