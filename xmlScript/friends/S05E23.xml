<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But again, Simmons. Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I think we should see other people.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-52"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-53"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-54"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-55"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-56"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Art lover!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-58"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I said art lover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-59"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Is that supposed to be an insult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-60"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't know, I'm very tired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-61"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-62"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That sounds great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-63"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-64"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-65"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-66"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-67"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Naked alone time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-68"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-69"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, what about after I give you these candies? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ah-ha! Okay,  Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Happy plane-aversary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Aww! I love you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can I give you a present now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay!  Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What-what Richard thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What Richard thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Simmons! Go with Simmons!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I'm not mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, London 1…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.}  Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen…naked! I'm picking up an orange.  I'm naked!  Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this.  Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!  Love to love ya, baby!  Darnit!  Ugh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
