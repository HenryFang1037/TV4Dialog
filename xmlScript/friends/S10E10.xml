<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So? What do you think of the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's perfect. It's everything we're been looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don't you love the huge yard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And the fireplace in the bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is bringing out a lovely color in you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So? Do you think we should get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't know. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think we should.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How bad you wanna smoke, right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right. . He is a good guy. Youâ€™re right, he wouldn't cheat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Believe me, if I did see with someone, there's no way I... </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We think Chandler might be having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You son of a bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Who's Nancy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why do you have a realtor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So you're gonna move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  I'm gonna thump you! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Actually, we already found a house we love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And about an hour ago, we made an offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You put an offer on a house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-46"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-47"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-48"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You know that's not the reason Joe. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-49"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-50"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-51"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What the hell are you doin'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-52"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-53"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but so is this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-54"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-55"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-56"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You can see where he'd have trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-57"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-58"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-59"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That money is mine, Green!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-60"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You're fly is open, Geller!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-61"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-62"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-67"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-68"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-69"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-70"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-71"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-72"><speaker>Monica and Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-73"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Youâ€™re just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-74"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-75"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! You know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but you know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, sheâ€™ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that IæŠŽ like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-76"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-77"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-78"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-79"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-80"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-81"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well you know, I don't want you to be cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-82"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-83"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-84"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She really left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-85"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-86"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-87"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No problem roomie. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-88"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-89"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-90"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What the hell is that dog doing here?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-91"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-92"><speaker>All</speaker><content>That's so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-93"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.</content></utterance>

And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. </content></utterance>
