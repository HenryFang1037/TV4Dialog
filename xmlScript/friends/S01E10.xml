<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>W-wait. What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, no, I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why don't you just get a roommate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Might wanna open with the snowman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, how'd it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So what are you gonna be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you wish!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah, okay. Alright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Woooo! Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, you're on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, oh, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.  </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>No. No, that's- that's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> That guy's going home with a note!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Could you speak up please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>David</speaker><content> Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>Daryl Hannah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>Hard quality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>David</speaker><content>-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, we're gonna take a short break. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come here, Marcel. Sit here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Just a smidge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think it's romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Too many jokes... must mock Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nice shoes, huh? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Aah, y'killing me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you always have to bring him here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>David</speaker><content>...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, alright, I have a question, then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Yuh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be  yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Rrrreally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>David</speaker><content>...Now? Now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah, right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Okay, okay, okay.  Y'know what, this was just really expensive.  And I'll take- this was a gift. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Okay, what the hell, what the hell.  You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can hop. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know more than one Fun Bobby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I happen to know a Fun Bob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay, here we go...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> There. Now there is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Five. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, uh... what juggling thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>Phoebe. Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, he hasn't been around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Minsk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>Minsk. It's in Russia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know where Minsk is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So when, when do you leave?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations! This is so exciting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>It'd be even more exciting if we were going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, you're not going?  Oh, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Thank you, Max. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So-so you're really not going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh don't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Please.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>David</speaker><content>No, but I can't-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's your thing, and-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>David</speaker><content>-make the decision-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, um, stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Getting so good at that! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>David</speaker><content>It was Max's stuff. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You remember Janice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Vividly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Hi, I'm Sandy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Yeah. That's okay, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Par-tay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That thing is not coming in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright. Just keep him away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you.  C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling?  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Rome. Jerk missed his flight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And then... your face is bloated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow, that's, uh, dirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Sandy</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, kids...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content> There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> But you found me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Kill me. Kill me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Fun Bobby</speaker><content>Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Fun Bobby</speaker><content>It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content> Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh, no. Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sorry you misunderstood...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, will you give me the thing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hi, Max!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>Yoko.  I've decided to go to Minsk without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>Max</speaker><content>It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you alright?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-44"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You're going to Minsk.</content></utterance>
