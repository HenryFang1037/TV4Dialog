<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I have no idea. But look how much they spent!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know. It's just such reckless spending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? It's, it's just a phase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, that's what we said about Joey...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This woman's living my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You're not an artist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Nooo...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How about Joey... Pepponi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey... Switzerland?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it does not ring a bell with me...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Might wanna try Joseph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi.  Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Alright, great. Thanks a lot.  I'm going to tap class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What d'you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Lotsa things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Which one do you think she is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>May I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What does she mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I think she means  'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content> People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She could be you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I'm not getting this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I'm totally getting it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? You just click when they click.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Great. It's gym class all over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Phoebe and Rachel</speaker><content>Aww.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>She's your partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Hi. I'm Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content> Monana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. It's Dutch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Teacher</speaker><content>And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler and Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Where've you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>At the vet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey! He beat ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So what does this mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm gonna have to give him up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Isn't there any way you can keep him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How do you get a monkey into a zoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey. We found her, we found the girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Did you call the cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Nope. We took her to lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>...Take off their hats!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No way. No way did you do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>Monana was very brave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>'Scuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh God.  We didn't get into Scranton.  That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, somebody will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You're kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, you'd think I would've.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>...Flame Boy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Where exactly is your zoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Dr. Baldhara</speaker><content>Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Dr. Baldhara</speaker><content>Does he, uh, fight with other animals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no, he's, he's very docile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Dr. Baldhara</speaker><content>Even if he were... cornered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I, I don't know. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Dr. Baldhara</speaker><content>Uh, how is he at handling small objects?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Dr. Baldhara</speaker><content>How about a hammer, or a small blade?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why- why- why would he need a blade?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Dr. Baldhara</speaker><content>Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Chandler and Joey</speaker><content>He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>...He's in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Dr. Baldhara</speaker><content>You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yo- hooo!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>That I was not expecting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>Oh. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Not necessarily...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Fake Monica</speaker><content>Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Um, I'm not actually Amish.</content></utterance>
