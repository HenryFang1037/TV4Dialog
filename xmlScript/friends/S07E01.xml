<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there.  Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe just 10 minutes for you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Why to save your dignity my man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I don’t care, she slept with me.</content></utterance>
