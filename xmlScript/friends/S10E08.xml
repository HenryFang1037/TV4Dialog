<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We need to talk to you about something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>All</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you kidding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no! We made this decision together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She's putting words in your mouth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, it's not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's not?  When was she born?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you, Pheebs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What? You are way off, lady!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You're not making the pies yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I entered this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Did you at least win the contest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can't wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey Rach.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What's Emma doing today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh... okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And a thousand dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that  what's in the inside is important...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I was thinking...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Did someone drop the baton again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I don't get older. I just get better!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You don't know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Somebody is gonna pick us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Name one of his books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> "The Firm"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Tell me more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these  Not with soap!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dude, I wanted him to guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, they're great seats too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Guess where they are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Center ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Did I do something to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hmm, the game's at one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude, two times that happened!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He's right, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's some gentle comedy, dude. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared.  It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, you have to calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohhhh! These seats are great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Ross' shirt is torn.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time!  OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> We know you're out there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Who do you think its from?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first.  Ready? .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Ah-haah! I win!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's locked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Alright, come on...  Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.</content></utterance>
