<utterance uid="3-62"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>I’m an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-63"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My mother killed herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-64"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>She, now I knew that and…now I’m sweating. Look at me, I’m really sweating—Now I’m saying, "Look at me," I’m getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-65"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-66"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Eric. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-67"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why are you looking at me like that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-69"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.  So, what are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-70"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>I don’t think they have a name for it. It’s just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-71"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> No I-I meant your costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-72"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Oh umm, I’m the solar system.  Yeah, my students helped me make it—I teach the second grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-73"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I love the second grade!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-74"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-75"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-76"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>So what do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-77"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-78"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Y’know you don’t have to stand here with me, believe me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-79"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-80"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Oh I feel very lucky, she’s great. I think she’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-90"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-91"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-92"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No you’re fine.  All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-96"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-97"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I would say, "Woman, please!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-98"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey. Ursula’s fiancée is really sweet! He’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know, I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-99"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, Phoebe!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-40"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-41"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content> What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-42"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-43"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Well, I guess I’ll see you at the wedding. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-44"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-45"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>I think we’ll be okay. Besides it’s so perfect and  she’s been saving herself for me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-47"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-48"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me.  Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.  Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-49"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>She told me she was 25.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-50"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I almost don’t want to show this.  Just remember I’m a minute younger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-51"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher. There’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-52"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No. You’re not, you’re not stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-53"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>I’m not smart.  I just wanted so much to…be impulsive once. To be romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-54"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-55"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>It’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-56"><speaker>Ursula</speaker><content> Eric!! Let’s go!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-57"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>I’d better go, deal…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-63"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-65"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really? You think that’s all it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-66"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. </content></utterance>
