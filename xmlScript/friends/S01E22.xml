<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How was that possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there?  Oh, ah. I should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Yeah, I'd really like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ethan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you a virgin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You keep saying that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No-no. Nothing wrong about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>Well, you never told me how old you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Young Ethan</speaker><content>I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don't say it. </content></utterance>
