<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What’s-what’s the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What did you do on yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I went to Egypt with my dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can see it now, "Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!" </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!"  All right? I mean she’s taken my class!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And slept with the professor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m gonna call her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?"  "Uhh, okay—I gotta go!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay sure!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Ross, it’s going to be okay. I’m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.</content></utterance>
