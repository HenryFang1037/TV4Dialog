<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I did not know that! Thank you Monica.  I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dahhhhh!!  No! Noooo!! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Fair enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.  Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.   Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Zelner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh! You are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Um-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, well then how about a handshake?  Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You didn't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on, we can't let them win!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I freaked out a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!   And now we're back.</content></utterance>
