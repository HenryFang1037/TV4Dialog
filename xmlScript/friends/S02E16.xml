<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>MR. GELLER</speaker><content>Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>MR. GELLER</speaker><content>Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>What's 1922?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>MRS. GELLER</speaker><content>I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>MR. GELLER</speaker><content>I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>MRS. GELLER</speaker><content>I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>MR. GELLER</speaker><content>Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Well that's how I feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well then maybe you should take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Well then maybe I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Fine with me.</content></utterance>
