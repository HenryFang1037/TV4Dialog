<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Buddy?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>EDDIE</speaker><content>Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>But you've only slept with two people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
