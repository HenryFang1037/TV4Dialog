<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ha-ha.  No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Don’t get me started.  Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they’re hanging out with Joey."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What do ya say? What do ya say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.  But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Um-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What am I making him by the way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I thought I was making him filet mignon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>God, Susan is so fun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! No! I-I meant for the baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…  Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Raymond Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Someone you didn’t make up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, that guy really hurt us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>What’s too much fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Emily’s straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, wake up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, Carol really messed you up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This totally makes sense!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It does not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Absolutely! Absolutely!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is so much fun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This is not fun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’re actually going through with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.</content></utterance>
