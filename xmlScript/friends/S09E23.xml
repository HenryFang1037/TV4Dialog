And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, right, because he's a scientist!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Wow! This place is beautiful!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That... never happens...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! This is very flattering, uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I would love your autograph. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content> Are you a paleontologist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mike?? Who's Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>David</speaker><content>It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> She does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Let's get you out of here!! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>At least you took me down with you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I guess, in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>David</speaker><content> Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I wouldn't read too much into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Seriously, we're gonna do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, because his penis was too big.  Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>David</speaker><content>That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I didn't mean now...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Why not? It's brilliant!  Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!  well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...  Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>David</speaker><content> How do you think I should propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>David, I'm pretending to read here!!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content> I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You really should have been more clear about that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Oh my God! Did you talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?" </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Will you wear a thong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I will if you will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I'm good, I have dinner plans .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>So you'll be ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>David is going to propose to Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?  Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Man, that's some bad advice!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey! Hey what's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could  share that with a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Not Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, right!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>David</speaker><content>So, um... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's um... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is um... is quite poor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Nice! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That would be advice!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok fine. I'll handle this.  Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I need to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you leaving "The Supremes"? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>MOnica</speaker><content>Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow? Really? That's fantastic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..."  You know, it's every girl's dream!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What?  May I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Actually the wet season is June to December.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, oh my God. What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why, why would you open it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Get out! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-46"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright, ok, let's do it.  Um, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... um, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honored, uh..." Spit it out, David!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Uh, Phoebe, uh...  you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure, ok, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>David</speaker><content>But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>David</speaker><content> Ok, would you care for my seat as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Actually yeah, that'll be great.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Sorry David, but she really has to know this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I have a ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-30"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Phoebe, will you marry me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-32"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Um... Ha ha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-34"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>We can have any future you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-35"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Ok, I'm gonna take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-37"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Just so I know, if I had asked first...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-39"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-40"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Is it ok if I hug you now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-41"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Not to mention the cold sores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Uh, Phoebe, uh...  you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure, ok, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>David</speaker><content>But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God, Mike!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>David</speaker><content>It's David, actually!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, Mike's here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>David</speaker><content> Hi Mike!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hi David. Chandler. Monica...  Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>IT'S THE HUMIDITY!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hi Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I have a question I need to ask you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>David</speaker><content> Ok, would you care for my seat as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Actually yeah, that'll be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>David</speaker><content>That's fair, you've had a long trip. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-24"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-25"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Sorry David, but she really has to know this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-26"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-28"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I have a ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-30"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Phoebe, will you marry me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-32"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Um... Ha ha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-34"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>We can have any future you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-35"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Ok, I'm gonna take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-37"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Just so I know, if I had asked first...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-39"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-40"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Is it ok if I hug you now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-41"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Open your drapes! Open your drapes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey! Remember when I had corneas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Nooo!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Not to mention the cold sores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He said "erectus"!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, he really said it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Erectus?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Why not?</content></utterance>
