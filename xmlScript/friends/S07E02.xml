<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Who wants French toast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll have some!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What’s the matter honey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged!  How long before it starts getting annoying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It starts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Already?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I got some thoughts on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What in God’s name is that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance.  First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That is so smart!  Break it off. Break it off now.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you…   Wh-what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nothing—Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, you said it was urgent!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick…  And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?  Y’know, something a little snugglyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, the duck…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Centerpieces!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! Roses or Lilies? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Definitely roses.  Well, I just think they’re a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! It’s like one mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh-huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, I’m gonna go! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Now Joey, what did the duck do?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey little buddy, how are you feeling?  What the hell is in that face cream?  That’s so soft.  Pillowcases!   Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar… The vicar?  …wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his… Whoa!  Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! </content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, Phoebe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh Ross, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, let’s talk outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And they knew about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, did you my face cream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey,  where did you learn that word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Where do you think,  Zelda?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> You found my book?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah I did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You got porn!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Hi, is uh Phoebe here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Ohh great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Can I, can I help you with something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know. Are you a masseur?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yes I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Great!  Dad!  Thank you so much, I’ll be back to pick him up in an hour. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah, I should probably call them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I remember when we first got engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh dad, really you don’t need to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content> Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I still don’t know that happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content> You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What a sweet story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>What?! They wanted a scary story!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>You tell her Jack, I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You bought the beach house when I was 23!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t put a price on that sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>We really do feel bad about this though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What about when I started dating Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think he’d ever propose!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>We might still have some money, if your father didn’t think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>It seemed like such a simple idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore!  Good luck, Chandler. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you.  Ohh, that’s soft. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well what happened at dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>My parents spent the money for our wedding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> My God! What did you order?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, it’s gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Do you even understand what off the rack means?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How? I don’t have any money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I have some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, close to… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well what?! How-how much is it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh!  Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Rachel and Monica</speaker><content>Ah, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Wow!  Hello, Mr. Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is the most special day of our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, umm I-I love you,  but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay?  Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, I am!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Excuse me ladies.  I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I gave him an extremely professional massage!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ehh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Eh, you work for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You do?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, you’re so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?</content></utterance>

Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.</content></utterance>
