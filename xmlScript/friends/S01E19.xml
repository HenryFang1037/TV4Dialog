<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know, I know, I'm sorry-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I-  Oh! Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Intercom</speaker><content>Animal Control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>See? I've even called Animal Control!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You called Animal Control?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi, thanks for coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Luisa</speaker><content> Somebody called about a monkey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Turned out it was a hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Luisa</speaker><content>Marcel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>My uncle Marcel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Luisa</speaker><content>Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, but there isn't always time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Luisa</speaker><content>Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, none at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Luisa</speaker><content>Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Luisa</speaker><content>Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.  But you? What a bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>Luisa</speaker><content>I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. </content></utterance>

If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.</content></utterance>
