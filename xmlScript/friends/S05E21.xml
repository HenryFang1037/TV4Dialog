<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hiya doin' pumpkin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nope. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>What do you, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content> I'll see you after work sweetie. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, what movie should we see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?! Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can't believe this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, but it is fast. Isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, what are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Me?! Why me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a…man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That is so sweet! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. </content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Also an island.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> 2:17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you serious?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hey, you guys…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Is Monica here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Joey and Ross</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You bought Shawn Cassidy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey and Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay!  Check it out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What-what is it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What the hell is that?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's a, it's a cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes it is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why is it inside out?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How much did you pay for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah? How much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>A thousand bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>ON A CAT??!!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's not a cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's not a cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhh, the ball thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey ladies! What are you in here for? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Gary, I'm here to report a crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content> What's up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Sure. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You mean scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>No, I mean happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Scared? Happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Chandler, what-what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>I know! I can't wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Were you're parents happy, or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>So you know what I'm talking about, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>No, it's too soon for you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yeah, you're right about that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.  It was right here, where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How do you know? You don't have a watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, we haven't dropped it in… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>2 hours, 27 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good.   Yes!!   Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey Rach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You have scratches all over you, what happened? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it's my cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah, I got a cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't want a cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I was gonna let you play with it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes I did, and I think you should do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh!! God!  Ooh!  Get out of here, good for nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Hey Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Gar!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content> Hi sweetie.  Hi, can I talk to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>You look very pretty today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Thanks! Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Here's the thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>I want you to move in with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content> Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content> Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Which is why my answer is yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content> Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh!  I'm so…happy. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's right baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, let me in. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> No-no! Don't do it! Don't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He's a dropper!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah, that's right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm not a dropper!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's throwing and catching!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh! Oh! That's so hard. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my—Oh good God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Baking it didn't help, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I tried! They won't take her back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rach, why won't they take it back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Phoebe and Gary</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why, do you write him a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Oh really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Nothing at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.  Can I get some water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, yeah! Today's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>'Cause uh, this is today's Post  and uh, these are the listings I found.  Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom.  Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.  Brooklyn Heights,  Brooklyn Heights,  Brooklyn Heights!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Let me tell you what I think might be going on.  No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me.  Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts!  I'm sorry! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Phoebe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just—I want you to be happy</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Living with you would make me happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Phoebe, you don't have to say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Oh that's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh wait, one sec. One sec.  Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms,  which was never!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind!  Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away!  Damnit!  Cat, can't you at least smile or something?!
