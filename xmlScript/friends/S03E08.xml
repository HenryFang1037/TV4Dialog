<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I will have one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I'm not gonna have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Neither will I. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, it's just my tooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right I'll have one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See that is the problem with invisible dentists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why? Why can't you go to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And all these people actually died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.</content></utterance>
