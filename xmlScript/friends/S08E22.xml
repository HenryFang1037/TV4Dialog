<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in THX! I’m unsuitable for children!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Now I cannot wait to see this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, it’s already generating Oscar buzz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I started that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you’re all invited! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are we gonna take a limo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure! Why not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You. Like you haven’t done enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.  Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story. Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea?   Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let’s. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey! Did you have the baby yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you doing here so early?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or you can do volunteer work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Estelle</speaker><content>Joey! It’s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Estelle</speaker><content>Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You’ll be sitting next to HotGuy372.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Estelle</speaker><content>Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up?  Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What-what about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You said you didn’t want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Definitely not invisible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I haven’t seen this dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Star in a movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you?  Phoebe, Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You really want to take me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you’re never actually going to pay me back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks. That means a lot to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I’m gonna go shave. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just  right out of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’re on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, how much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>One hundred thousand dollars!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How about fifty bucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> All right, who’s turn is it to help me get up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No one’s here!  Oh damnit!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A little tall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?  There you go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s just so glamorous.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Fine! You’re on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She’s in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, we gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>In a minute!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> All right, all right. Let’s go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good God man don’t anger it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m actually with her on this one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Okay, this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can I ask you something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>When Carol was pregnant with Ben…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>…were you this irritating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay.  Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi Dr. Long, how are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh, you’re nice to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She has the drugs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>We’ll do a quick check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>So, eight days late huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>You must be a little uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Eh, just a tad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>You’re about 80 percent effaced, so you’re on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Do them!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>Actually, they’re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I’ve found that some of them are quite effective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, we are ready to try anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>You can take some caster oil, there’s eating spicy foods…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Great! We will do all of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Dr. Long</speaker><content>…taking a long walk, and then there’s the one that’s proved most effective: sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’ve got to be kidding me!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You liked it? You really liked it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh-ho-ho, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Which part exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The whole thing! Can we go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry!  Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!  Or, call an ambulance.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks that,  "That will open up a can of worms."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica, what is the matter with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why? Why today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’ll take that bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Can I get some of that action?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, okay!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! Sleeping beauty!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know, five hundred dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that’s… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you want a calculator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, what else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Which we’re still keeping under our hats!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What the hell are you talking about,  "The south will rise again man."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, money well spent!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on, finish your enchilada.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot!  Oh my— By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Stop it.</content></utterance>
