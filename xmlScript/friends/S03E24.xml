<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What if Joey were president?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, ah with who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.  A house painter! He used to be a house painter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Promise me you’ll be careful.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Bonnie</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Bonnie</speaker><content>Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that must be it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How could you not tell me that she has hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ohh, well, this is just perfect!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why, does she have a bad personality?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Bing!  Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun.  Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on.  Wham!  Good one. That was a good one.  Keep at it team. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Phil</speaker><content>Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Stevens</speaker><content>I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content> Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>There you go. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>God Ross, what is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Announcer</speaker><content>From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I love you, Pete!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Announcer</speaker><content>And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right! You go get him! Let’s go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Referee</speaker><content>Here we go gentlemen, here we go!  Are you ready?   Are you ready?  Let’s get it on!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!  It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>What, look back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, no. But...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You didn’t know that already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, just get a lot better.  Fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. That-that was the problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hot dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Four, please.  I’m really nervous.  Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh, that’s too bad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I-I’m saying I liked her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey, the fight’s starting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, we’ll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Fight’s over!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content> Bing! You got those numbers for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I ah, I didn’t do them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Oh, you forgot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller.  That’s okay, you’re still my number one guy!  Bing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Doug!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Oh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Ha!  Ahhhhhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ahhhhh! </content></utterance>
</scene>
