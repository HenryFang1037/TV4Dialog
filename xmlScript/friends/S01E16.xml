<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Mr. Douglas</speaker><content>You’re kidding? She seems so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. Nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Mr. Douglas</speaker><content>That’s unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Mr. Douglas</speaker><content>I see. I guess you never really know what’s goin’ on inside a person’s head.</content></utterance>
