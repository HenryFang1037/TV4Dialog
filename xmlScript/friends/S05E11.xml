<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  And it starts right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really?! How come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really? Who-who have you taught?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I taught me and I love me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't gossip!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? They were like this!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.  Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here,  then you learn here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Umm, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.   So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I didnâ€™t! Even when I found outâ€¦umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Then don't touch one!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I like 'em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I like them a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh come on!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay, seriously, what do you think?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's my New Year's resolution!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, to blind my child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, hold on!   They're not coming on man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Umm, do you see anyâ€”oh, Vaseline?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What difference does that make?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I'm justâ€”if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!</content></utterance>
