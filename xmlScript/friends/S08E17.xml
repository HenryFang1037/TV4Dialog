</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh God! That’s Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, you have to talk to her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!  Don’t eat that! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Is Joey here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t see him.  Do you see him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl!  Joey? Nope! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, at least you make each other laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We were playing a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?! No! No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, did you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, a naked bagel game?   Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, you gotta talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right so, so what do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on your…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> We didn’t play it!!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I didn’t know you read tea leaves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I’m done. Read mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.  Ooh, I see a ladder.  Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, I’m done. Do mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.  Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh!  Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What does yours say Pheebs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm… Wow, all right.  Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You mean your pink shirt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Faded salmon color.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well just ask Mona to give it back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Tea gives Phoebe the trots.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>In the James Taylor case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Where is the James Taylor CD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah. That makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh, I can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Good.  Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow!  Y’know what, if we’re gonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So you uh, have a…big work problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Huh. Okay.  So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, and umm my baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>My boss wants to buy my baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?! Oh my-oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What he wants to buy your baby?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can you believe that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s crazy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s what I told him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, how did this even happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well I’ll tell ya!  See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh! Yeah!  Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh hello.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o’clock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, maybe we will.  Oh! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content> I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>No, it’s still wet. Y’know what? Let me get it out before it sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>No-no that’s a man’s shirt.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>May I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>Someone does. Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, witty banter. Well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>So, tell me a little bit about yourself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I’m staring. It’s just that you have the most beautiful eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>And your breasts! Hmm!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Jim</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Let’s just say I took care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler and Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?! Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And you couldn’t think of anything else?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You can always sell your baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>I’ve asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Mr. Zelner</speaker><content>If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby…I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, as long as we are clear about that. </content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?  When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, we both can. And we both will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>I hope you don’t think I’m crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>A little.   Now you’re talking.</content></utterance>
