<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What is this? Fruit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica's making jam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because the kids need new shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.  Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>This will just be my batch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Well thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait,  you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Yeah, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.  Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Mon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wait a minute, look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, look, look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What, what, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's an empty apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We're all alone in an empty apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes  Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do I look fat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross and Rachel</speaker><content>Noo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Nooo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And it works both ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, so you both just know this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's easy, baggage claim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right are you guys gonna come down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Good luck Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thank you Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Bye sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Bye hon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm gonna use the cushion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, the old hug and roll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, one question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Shoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> You're so pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey, Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You talked to him. Are you crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey Mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, this is for you.  It's blackberry curin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Aww.  Ohh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked  , or, or a big tub of jam. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Put your hands together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No more jam?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, what happened to your jam plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm talking about me having a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That, that's what's stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Down at the docks again?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Malcom</speaker><content>I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Malcom</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Malcom</speaker><content>See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh, it's not the ideal way...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Check it out!! Jam crackers!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.</content></utterance>
