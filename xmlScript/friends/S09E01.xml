</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Isn't she beautiful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Look at her, my first grandchild.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What about Ben?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter.  Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude I just did something terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That was you?! I thought it was Jack!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?! Why does she think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Because it kinda looked like I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Again, what?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>As we all are at some point during the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know! I know it's awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, what did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> She said yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Does Ross know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I like that. Yeah -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Now let's not get carried away. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I want a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm so tired.  Yeah okay, but no foreplay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Deal!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Noted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Actually umm - </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uhh - I think I just got engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God! He did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well - did you know he was gonna ask me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And you really think this is a good idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired, people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?! Even Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Especially Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just - I'll come back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>There he goes, your fianc閑.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I guess so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Although he does play with himself in his sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I can't say that I'm surprised.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I think there are people in there having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It can't be me, I'm standing right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Wanna peek?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y'know what? I don't like you without mom.  Come on. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> We're not peeking? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Well I'm peeking.  Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hello sir, you know Monica.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey uh, is it okay to come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I - it's beautiful! I love it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don't worry. It'll happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yowsa! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dear Lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y'know, I don't really know her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Are you kidding me?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't know! Maybe she's crazy! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh hey! Wait up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn't know if he knew yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, me too.  Should we wake her up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And so engaged. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?  Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross, doctors are supposed to be smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I didn't give her that ring!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So whose ring is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Is it an engagement ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But you didn't give it to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But you were going to propose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Huh, I might be losing interest in this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is see if she maybe - kinda - wanted ah - to start - things up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I didn't! I didn't propose!  Unless uh -  Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and - it does sound like something I would do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, we can't stay in here forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of my piano recitals, but this he sees!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Of course. I'll always be your dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It wasn't fun?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why -  Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there!  I'll guard the door!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you ovulating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Daddy?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That's how I got my bad hip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>You're right, you're right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't feel good right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey. I need to tell you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey asked me marry him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey proposed to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I-I said yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's - It is bigger than mine! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You can't marry him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well do you love him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, the question is - do you really want to marry Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, look, just do it gently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Listen, I um - I heard about the engagement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Surprised?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um - I didn't propose to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
