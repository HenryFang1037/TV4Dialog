<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why’d you say no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle.  Seriously, proud of you.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content> Y’know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Can I get you anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>Umm, I’ll have a cup of coffee.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Host</speaker><content>Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>This is the first time he’s ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.  Go ahead.  This works with any milk carton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Lauren</speaker><content>So this is it? Victor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship,  and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad for the paper tray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nice work my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Matter of fact, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.  Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions,  then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It tastes like feet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I like it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>Understood. So, what’d you say back then?</content></utterance>
