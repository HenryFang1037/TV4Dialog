<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh-huh, that one!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh that's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh, PBS!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What's wrong with PBS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh, what's right with them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What-what are you talking about?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, may I ask for one example?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's because all people are selfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you calling me selfish?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> Hello, Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily!  It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst!  Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Really? About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> She's talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>All</speaker><content> Yay! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That he doesn't exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Right. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I might've said that.  Why is that funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because I'm very happy for him!  And you, you lucky dog!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>In London!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She wants me to move to London.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But you live here!  You know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What-what-what are you gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It could happen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Stage Director</speaker><content>This will be your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Stage Director</speaker><content>No you answer it and take pledges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But I'm the host!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Stage Director</speaker><content>No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Stage Director</speaker><content>Well, here's your phone doctor. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler!  Is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I understand that would be difficult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I don't know, it's just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, did you just say all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I did. Now I'm the idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know. I am, I am so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Again, very sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh that is so great! That's…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh-ohh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! You can't—what did you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's true!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's true!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, you cannot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks for the help, problem solved. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hello.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> You're not on TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, there he is! There he is!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Expect it in 4-6 weeks.  Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Aw, dammit! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>PBS Volunteer</speaker><content>Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on man! You've been here all day!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Stage Director</speaker><content>We're on in 3, 2, </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Gary Collins</speaker><content>Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil,  and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do  is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to… </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, it's not a toy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?  Ask again later. Later is not good enough.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> PBS Telethon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hi Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And you don't a little good about donating the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Gary Collins</speaker><content> It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers… Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers,  Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Keep talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
