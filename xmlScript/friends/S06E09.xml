<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, great!  Bye.  So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sydney Portier? Hehheh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I miss Rachel.  No, my parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Why can’t I tell them that we live together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because they don’t know we’re dating.  Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why haven’t you told them?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t they be happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What? What? Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You really think that’ll work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!  Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yes, of course they like you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well Monica just told me that they don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah, they don’t like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Do you know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well maybe I love ya’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>For real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ye-ye, we go to yours!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, sweetie, I-I trust you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You’re not gonna mess it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Some would say she’s attractive, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And who else is going to be there?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Hello everybody!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content> Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Whoa, snowing out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Ok, I have dandruff. There’s no need to laugh and point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>My joke wasn’t funny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch,  then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions,  then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>W-What was the one right before bananas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know.  Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y-sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Joey and Ross</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Vomiting stories are funny...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Still not hot enough!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of  condensed milk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight  I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>What’s the matter with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content> I think he’s stoned again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You do? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?! Why did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How could it not matter?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What about all that “friends forever” stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know, I-I was all high.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Monica, leave him alone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh I am!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Dude, they’re not objects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Eh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> You’re alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re  alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-58"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.</content></utterance>
