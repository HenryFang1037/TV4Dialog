<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, I told her you already knew.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys.  Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriber’s note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, I’d have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>There’s a lost and found?  My shoe! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You left a shoe here?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Great! Thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yeah, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay, see ya! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for when——people with babies come to visit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s not mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content> I love your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s  mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I bet it’s fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> It’s got ‘em!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe you could be my roommate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well there’s an idea!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay Rach, but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Op! You’re peeping!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look I told you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What about the time I said we were on a break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Pheebs, how’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Shocking! Since you still have the keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What equity investments?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t even have a car!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And six others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>There you are.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, she tops out at 130.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, take it easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>The Porsche Owner</speaker><content>Hey! That’s my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>The Porsche Owner</speaker><content>What-what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>The Porsche Owner</speaker><content>But it’s my car!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, but it’s my wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>The Porsche Owner</speaker><content>Listen, I-I-I don’t come to this city much so I don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure. Here.  I’ll uh, save your parking spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>The Porsche Owner</speaker><content>I’m not coming back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>The Porsche Owner</speaker><content>I live upstate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, so did I.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Glass, sand, whatever. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I can still do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How are you still single?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> All right.  I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Good. What made you change your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How did that happen?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat.  </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine, I’m mentally unstable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh yes, heroin and crack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, you would know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ross, please, I found the magazines!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>That won’t be necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And what——What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing!  Hey! Stop typing!  Stop typing! Stop typing!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>You need to get out of my chambers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Judge</speaker><content>Would you like to spend the night in jail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And thank you for your time. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> So the Porsche guy took his car back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But you found the keys to his clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That is true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think that’s gum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m pretty sure it’s gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Passerby</speaker><content>Maybe because you’ve got the keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Porsche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>This is totally your fault!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>My fault?! You threatened the judge!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi! How are the Gellers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Don’t call us that! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! It’s Porsche!! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one.  Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s.  I broke it. All right. Well, that’s just the way that goes.  Okay, good.  Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer.  Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!  Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh!  Oh, you’re a lot mischievous! Well, it’ll dry.   Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, don’t push it though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Did I, did I even treat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Eh, no problem.</content></utterance>
