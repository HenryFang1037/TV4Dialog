<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I——Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because it's too delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  Momma’s Little Bakery.  I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, I’m sorry what?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Absolutely!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’ll see you at 8:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, what’s at 8:00?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Duly noted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks.   Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You were invited?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know, she tried to undress me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I used to undress my cousin Glenn. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> "Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy."  Big Daddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry.  How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, you wore me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>The Ross—Is that back?!! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can’t seem to say goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling…  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Awww! Mel Torme died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, that paper’s like a year old!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got "and guest?!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Not broad backed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? I can’t cancel on Joan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> We’ll see.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, thank you for lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Its still there! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Mrs. Braverman must be out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No that could kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, we don’t want that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No so we’re protecting her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But we should take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But we should move quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! </content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>David</speaker><content> Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?</content></utterance>

And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>David</speaker><content>Really? Because I think about you all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>David</speaker><content>I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So! He’ll understand!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>God, you are so strong.</content></utterance>
