<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!</content></utterance>

I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If I help, we can find 'em faster!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fine, I'll give the suit back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Santa? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, is that okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Right. So, I'm sorry...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Wendy</speaker><content>Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How drunk are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This doesn't feel weird!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're a really good kisser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hm-hmm!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! You are really fast!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're gonna see each other naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yep!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you wanna do it at the same time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Count of three?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>One!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Both</speaker><content>Three! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Eh, we weren't that close anyway!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Eh! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think you're better than you think you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? Okay, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.  Don't do the dance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Right!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're so efficient. I love you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let's go! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No-no-no, wait! We need something old!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That'll work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, now we just need something borrowed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's stealing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, one thing at a time. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ehh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Eh, you work for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You do?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, you're so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You thought about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How many kids were we gonna have?</content></utterance>

Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.</content></utterance>
