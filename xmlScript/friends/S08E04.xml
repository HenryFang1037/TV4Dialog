<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Welcome home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, how was the honeymoon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You’re welcome buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah, thanks. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The lie you just told.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That-that you came on to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There’s the one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But you did! I mean, let’s be honest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whom.  That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know you kissed me first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I was sending you signals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No please, show me how I begged you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can show you, I have it on videotape!  It’s an expression.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know who has a great video camera?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh I think we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, listen I am not a pervert!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I’ll try to control myself.</content></utterance>

I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  It was dead silent. Gorgeous.  And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Why?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No, I don’t…don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I was backpacking across Western Europe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m not feeling it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s been six months! I’m always hot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’ll try that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> That means a lot to me man. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?  Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera.  It kept rolling and recorded everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, definitely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you.  No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You’re right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey! No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Loud and clear! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Regina Philange. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well maybe it was all of your questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What about my questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Was that another question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hey! Is Ross still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?  Oh forget it!  Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here.  I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you.  What?  You don’t want to see this do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hell yeah!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I am not gonna show you this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Forget it, she’s destroying it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I wanna see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t want people to see it for your sake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rachel, please…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah, a little preview!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, here we go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hello! Can I get you anything?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’re gonna get pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> You didn’t do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>  I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it!  "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"  Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Did you do it on our invitations?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Not on the ones we sent out.</content></utterance>
