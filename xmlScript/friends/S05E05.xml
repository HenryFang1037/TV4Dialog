<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hi! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Monica? What time is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uhh, 9. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But it's dark out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait! What about Joey?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, she's out shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Damn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi, guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We're flipping Monica's mattress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah that's better than my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Aww, man! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh look! A letter from my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah! I know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Can you hear anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, Madlibs, mine! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Condoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And condoms are the way to do that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my God! My dog died!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Le Poo's still alive?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh.  Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's Le Poo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I can't believe it! We're here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come here.  Okay, be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're switching rooms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're nose is bleeding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh God.  No! Oh not again!  This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry.  Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Umm… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sorry. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Hotel Clerk</speaker><content>I think you'll find this room more to your liking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, great. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Hotel Clerk</speaker><content> They say he's only got half a tank left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're switching rooms again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Hotel Clerk</speaker><content>Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh-huh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, this one I like!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do not speak ill of the dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What did you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, what's up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>…is for me not to see you anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?   Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Storming out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rachel, this is your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How was your conference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It was terrible. I fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, you're back too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, how was your chef thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, fine, $300.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>300 dollars?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Urghh!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What are you guys woofing about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You want my advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes! Please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You're not gonna like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You got married to fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's not advice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I told ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm going to the bathroom. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chandler and Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe I could do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi, Rach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's not Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, you're not Kip!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Do you even know who Kip is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, that poor bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're not gonna be phased out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.  He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ehh!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes that was mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes that would have made more sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.  Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe?  I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing.  You gotta come with me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, but try and get Joey too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, sure!  Bye Ross!  Forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Ross…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe this is happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I am so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>  Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
