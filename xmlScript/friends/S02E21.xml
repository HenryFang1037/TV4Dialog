<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Ok honey, you really need a job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>How come those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>What happened to uh, MEG.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>So talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content> Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Why the voice.</content></utterance>
