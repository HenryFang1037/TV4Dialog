<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Huh?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Could we be more white trash?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> How desperate am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just pickle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> No. No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content> Hello, Rachel. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, not at first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What is she doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah-eh-eah!  Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content> How’s the hired help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Doing great, the quiches are coming along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>What’s this? Blue nail polish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I thought it was cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s hands looked like when we found her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Let me ask you a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why did you hire me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I didn’t hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! </content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content> Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhhhh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>Actually, I’m not buying. I’m selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you’re not really sure what they’re talking about?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>…I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Nooo!! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>…it was like the Algonquin kids table. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content> Excuse me, I’m sorry, you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Your nails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put…  Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great.  Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>  Honey, don’t bite your nails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content> I’m not freaking out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Then why are you laughing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Father owes me five dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What? You bet I’d lose a nail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh no, don’t be silly. I just bet I’d need these. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Frozen lasagnas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Um-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you’ve never been able to laugh at yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>No, I have faith…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> No! You have lasagnas! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Oven</speaker><content>Ding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Op, the ruined quiches are ready.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>No, we are. I’m sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content> Yes.  Uh, can’t you wait until tomorrow?  All right.  Unbelievable!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m getting dressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Wait. I wanna show you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.  Put your hands together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me.  Yeah, you are!  Ooh, saucy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content> I’ll be back in ten minutes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay. But if you don’t come back soon,  there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Sophie</speaker><content>Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s weird, she locked the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Sophie</speaker><content>Y’know why? She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Sophie</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi!  How are you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hello, Joanna……’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content> I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How little?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>A couple of hours, I feel awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>I can’t!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>I’m in my boss’s car!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Uh-oh, tunnel. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>  What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Rachel, could I see you for a moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You promised you would break up with her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it!  You never see Joanna again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Never!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You never come into this office again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You give me back my Walkman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I—never borrowed your Walkman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!  Ahhh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Does it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, this is much better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He cut off his ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>He painted that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>Let’s see, ahhh… Where does the Pope live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Spock’s birth control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content> You need these books.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This used to be your room?  Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one’s outta here." Though some things don’t change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! My breasts are really strong. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What if I clean your bathroom for a month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It still wouldn’t be clean.  All I want is my freedom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Foot rubs for a month!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Freedom!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>Well ah, what can you swing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>The Salesman</speaker><content>You don’t have, anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You wanna see what I got?  Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>With extra pulp?</content></utterance>
