<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What-what's so funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content> Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Okay, but only if you give me a drag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh.  Nope, that patch is no good. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pffhah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What's your problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Or what my Father called Thursday night.</content></utterance>

This is not fair to Frank,  and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Employee</speaker><content>Umm, I'm still here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content> You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Pete</speaker><content>One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go...</content></utterance>
