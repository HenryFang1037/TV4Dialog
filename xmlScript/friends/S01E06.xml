<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>Chandler?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> She said yes!! She said yes!!  Awful play, man. Whoah.  Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'.

<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>'We' would be me and Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Who's Rick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who's Rick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>My husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Ooooohhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, so you're divorced?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>No, I'm still married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>All</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>I suppose mainly sexual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>...Hm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I couldn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Good for you, Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah! C'mon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Tah-daaah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, whaddya think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Uh-oh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How-how did that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You guys, I am not that bad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know,  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That is so unfair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I could do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica? You're Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there!  That was my agent.  My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh my God! Whoah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, what's the part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Seriously, what-what's the part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>...I'm his </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What do you think? Today's the big day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thank you! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I warned you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Who is being loud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, you got the whole night, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>That would work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I'm- I'm showering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>No, that was clenching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don't go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>Okay. Oh no, I have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Too bad, she's leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content> I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>It's not Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>No, it's-it's Andrew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>He's... new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>No, that's not exactly what I was..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>So what do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>You have me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nono, just you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>Whaddyou mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Lose the other guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>...Like, ...all of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>C'mon, we're great together, why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content>Which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>...The second guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Aurora</speaker><content> Well, call me if you change your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.</content></utterance>
</scene>
