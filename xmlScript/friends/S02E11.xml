<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>So how did everything go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Well, we've gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh, you and me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Uh, no, Susan and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>The other us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>We're uh, we're getting married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Look I just thought that...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>Is your finger caught in that chair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Mmm hmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Want us to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Would it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Oh, you are so great!  Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Are you really not going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>If you wanna call that a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content> Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Ross, I thought you were over this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content> Did I miss it? Did I miss it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Whoa, she's pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>I'm sorry, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Oh, ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>There's my scene, there's my scene.  "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>MRS. WALLACE</speaker><content>Is she gonna be all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Excellent!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>That is so good! Do it again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No no, that's me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh, hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Is everything ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Oh, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I think it went into me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Ok, who ordered what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content> Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.  Sit up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>MRS. GREEN</speaker><content> There she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Mom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>Oh hello, Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hi, Mrs. Green. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh Mom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Believe me, sometimes that happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content> You have some life here, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>For...me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>Well, not just for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well, what do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>I'm uh, considering leaving your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content> All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>And you had no idea they weren't getting along?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>They didn't fight a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content> In my day, divorce was not an option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey, look who's up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>That's him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>MR A</speaker><content>Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>MR A</speaker><content>Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Um, do you wanna sit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>MR A</speaker><content>Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>MR A</speaker><content>You're saying, my wife is in you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>MR A</speaker><content>Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>MR A</speaker><content>Everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>MR A</speaker><content>Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>MR A</speaker><content> Worth a shot, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>Look at this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>These are from Halloween three years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Hey, Mon, you want some help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>If you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content> Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>She's still with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.  Oh, such a pretty face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-52"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-53"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-54"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-55"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-56"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh! What's new in sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>The only man I've ever been with is your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-60"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-61"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-62"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>You want me to talk you out of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-63"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-64"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Then what? What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-65"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-66"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Why on earth would I understand this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-67"><speaker>MRS GREEN</speaker><content>You didn't marry your Barry. I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-68"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-69"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-70"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-71"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Joey, speed it up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-72"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-73"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-74"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-75"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Sir! No sir!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-76"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content> All right, you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-77"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-78"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-79"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-80"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-81"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>How's it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-82"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-83"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Fine, whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-84"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-85"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-86"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-87"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-88"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Carol, what's the matter? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-89"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-90"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-91"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-92"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>It's ok. I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-93"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-94"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-95"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-96"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.</content></utterance>
