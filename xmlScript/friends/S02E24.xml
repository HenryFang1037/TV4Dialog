<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Then what's the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.</content></utterance>
