<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay so this is where the band is.  And this is where the bar is.  And all these pins have people’s names on them.  And Rach, here you are. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me  and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender.  These pins aren’t for playing are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, relax it’s not a contest.  Certainly not a close one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Rach. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh!  Let’s see, well…if this is the wedding hall then umm  you’re parents will be at home in Queens.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You got me. I don’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well this is just sad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That is not a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Maybe you’ll order a little sangria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, get out of here! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all.  But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You mean like for award shows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Some of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, who wore those? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Not bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> This one is uh Paul O’Neil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background.  Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Pierce Brosnan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s a pretty cool tux.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We should really learn how to play the real way. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I like our way. Oh!  Chess!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, what are you going to wear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh. Does Monica know about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can I please be there when you tell her? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What is this? What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey’s!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yeah, I’m sure that happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It-it did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.  It happened!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why are you taking this away from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Vanilla?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>To Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>When I got married you slept with my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That was pretty 007.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re not coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No she hasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, what am I going to say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them so… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hello?  Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani?  Hi, this is Monica Geller.  Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office!   T-Tell me about it!  Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office!  What are they Irish?! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>…anyway, his name is Allan and we’ve been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well.  And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, that’s great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>What one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Melissa</speaker><content>Oh, isn’t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Batman has a utility belt!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Actually, I don’t like martinis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The show?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Have you ever been to one of my weddings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!</content></utterance>
