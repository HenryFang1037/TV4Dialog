<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! That's wild!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, it matters to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You kissed her that night too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Seriously, where did this happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples' coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, she was definitely on my bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, then who was on my bed?</content></utterance>
