<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, right! Your adoption interview!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And so incorrect!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on, she's gonna love you guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And a lot could still get in our way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you gonna name the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, but...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and  you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>OW, why, why, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mandy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Do you think I'm someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Growth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Fine, I'll give you her number.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>C'mon! This looks good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I can see why, nice shirt!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're wearing the same shirt.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's what our friends call us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I don't think that's exactly...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Let her finish, doctor.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you talking about? Sarah's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>ALL FOOD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Oh, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What? You know about the plate thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> You wouldn't let her have a grape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no! Not me! Emma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks.  What were we talking about?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> This place is awesome!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know, we should just go, I'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah, this place is great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>: Hey, check this out! It's totally you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What? They will be!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Why do men keep talking to me like this?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Amen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It says "Do it!" And behold she did adopt unto them a baby. And it was good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content> Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Not for me it doesn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Agency guy</speaker><content>So, how's everything going in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>We're great, I think I may have asked all my questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Agency guy</speaker><content>Do you have any question for Erica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Agency guy</speaker><content>Yes, our system assures total anonymity. We're very proud of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You should be. You're really on top of stuff..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Agency guy</speaker><content> Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Actually, I don't think we have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We don't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So? What do you think? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Looks like someone IS the ladies!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We are NOT signing those papers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>God works in mysterious ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You have gotta stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But she liked us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Your Veal Chop is $34.95!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>oh, honey..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Please.. please, we are so close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> okay, right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You're Jewish.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Adoption Agency guy</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Agency guy</speaker><content>So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I-Is... Is that a picture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, doctor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Agency guy</speaker><content>I don't understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Agency guy</speaker><content>That's impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Agency guy</speaker><content>I'll go check your file. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>So who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>So you lied to me before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, we...  "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>I can't believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>I don't want to look at your file! This is over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Erica wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>I've nothing to say to you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You still want that baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>God bless you Chandler Bing!</content></utterance>
