<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is the New York Times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, may I see the comics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We are. He's meeting us here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! Rachel is meeting us here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh come on, they can be in the same room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why? What happened now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I had the same dream!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I had the opposite dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
