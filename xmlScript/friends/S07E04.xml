<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Awww.  But still no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
