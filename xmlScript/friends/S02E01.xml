<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Did you talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Then, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>It was you, pal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well, maybe it was God, doing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well, you owe me one, big guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Here's your lemonade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I didn't order lemonade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Go go go go, come on!  So then, well, what did you find out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>He said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>How is that the silver lining?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>You have to really wanna see it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No you're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>You gotta tell Ross how you feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>What's goin' on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No. No-no-no-no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No, I think that was the whole all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content> Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.</content></utterance>
