<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You're driving me crazy with that!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You wanna play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm intrigued.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Still, I was quick as a cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey's not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I didn't finish my five pages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on look guys, don't fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I paid for those tickets!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>When did that happen to you?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Krista</speaker><content>Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Krista</speaker><content>Here, I'll get it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Krista</speaker><content>We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, great!</content></utterance>
