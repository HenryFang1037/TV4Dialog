<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>ALL</speaker><content>Ohhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>You wanna be in charge of the food committee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See  honk honk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Why not her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Cause she uh, she steals stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Joey that is horriable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I didn't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hi honey, how did it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Agh, it was the graduation from hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>So what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Well, how bout just her mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Why her mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Cause I already invited her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content> Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>MR. GREENE</speaker><content>What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>MR. GREENE</speaker><content>Ohhh, you're having a parteee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>MR. GREENE</speaker><content>I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>MRS. GREENE</speaker><content>Hi Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>So, basically just a Chinese guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>MR. GREENE</speaker><content>Alright, that sounds like a two person job. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>MRS. GREENE</speaker><content>Well, my goodness, what was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>MRS. GREENE</speaker><content>You thought I was Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Yes because uh, you look so young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>And because you're both, you know, white women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>MRS. GREENE</speaker><content>Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>NO! No, I'll take that for ya.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content> Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Right this is staging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content> This is clearly in the wrong apartment. </content></utterance>
