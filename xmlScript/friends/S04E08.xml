<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Stop callin’!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content> Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Voice</speaker><content>What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything… </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So are things with you and Joey any better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You shouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Who gets whom.  I don’t know why I do that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We haven’t eaten yet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it…  Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it…  Her initials…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Who cares? He works in a museum!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is wrong with this freezer?!  Ow! Ow!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> People are trying to sleep in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Open it up, let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well maybe you should put some ice on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, God it looks bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He’s really picky about his patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Like I remember his office number!  Speed dial 7.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today.   He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes! She’s very excited about that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, get out of my kitchen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw her wear it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Everything? Even the TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! I’m putting that in my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Five years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’ve sentenced him?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, the guy’s your best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, who? Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>KATHY</speaker><content>Oh my God, is it really that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Dr. Burke will see you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We’ve got a box. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I was probably waiting for it to open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>I gotta tell you, you look great now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You look great too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>You’re an excellent patient!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So how does it look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Like a pirate?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>If that helps you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?  Come on, one of us had to mention him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>I moved back here a couple of months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh. Big family dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>Uh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>But we broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>She-she wasn’t ready for a serious commitment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh.  So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Tim</speaker><content>You’re not wearing the patch yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know, it’s sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why is it sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What’s twisted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Me going out with Richard’s son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Sounds like a really bad idea to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Is he okay in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He’s fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Fine! Judge all you want to but,  married a lesbian,  left a man at the altar,  fell in love with a gay ice dancer,  threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire,  livin’ in a box!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So now, what exactly is the point of the box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I just wanna check something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>  Now, we’ll see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Air hole! Air hole!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What did you get?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, okay, you got it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, can you pass me the yams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, fine. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Absolutely!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?  Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Don’t say that I have no sentiment!  This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these.  It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>KATHY</speaker><content>Oh. Well uh,  you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm…  Listen I don’t wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can’t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don’t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore. I’m gonna go to my mom’s in Chicago, I’m gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but y’know this is probably for the best. Y’know? I’m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.</content></utterance>
