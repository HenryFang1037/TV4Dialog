<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, no. No-no-no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? That's like insanely easy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? You forgot fourteen states?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nobody cares about the Dakotas. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, okay, time's up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, I got 48.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow, how many have you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fifty-six!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> How come we have one extra place setting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>'Cause you invited your assistant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Regular Celery!  Oh, I already have that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Done! With time a-to-spare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oooh that may be a New World's record </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? That's impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, just give me another minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pshhshhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler? Can you give me a hand? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, why is your bag moving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, it's not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Seriously, it's moving!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What the hell is in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's my pie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Which smells delicious!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh-oh! Uh-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We left Joey alone with the food!  Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry, who's this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, there's no dog here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my god! Where are you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'll be right there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> They're here already? How are they doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi Tag! What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, sure! Come in!  Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>We kinda broke up this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ohio!! Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Huh! Where is the dog?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What dog? There-there's no dog here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah that dog left!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>There's no dog in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No that's just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What is it doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait.  Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it still has to go, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Monica and Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, it's um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Don't do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don't do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>All</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you out of your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Told ya. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Is there a puppy here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>You don't like puppies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay, you are new!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You don't like ice cream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's too cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> It hurts my teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-49"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>1250.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-50"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Damn, I forgot you were here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-51"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-52"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-53"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-54"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-55"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I'd say about a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-56"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really? I'd say 3 to 4.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-57"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Half hour. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-58"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-59"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>When it's your assistant, I would say never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-60"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-61"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh. A moo-point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-62"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-63"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-64"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-65"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-66"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How are you holding up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Not bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So were you guys together a long time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Now that she broke up with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. Hmmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because, uh—it has to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>You have all the answers, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Hey, thanks for talking to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Street noise drowned any of that out?  No, all right, I see you later, okay... </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>What did Joey say? I like you back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No?  All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Wow. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content> Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Right there! That's my car!  Hey!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>I can't believe this! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Wait, we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet!  Oh look, there they go, okay. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's not gonna work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! I didn't know either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I knew.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Where's Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Here I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wash your hands!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How did you…know? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! What's she doing back here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, but, but look what I'm...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Where's Monica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I, I should go in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because you sent away the dog!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?  I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you.  Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You think?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and… I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We have good news, look whose back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Clunkers?! Oh my god!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's right, she came back all by herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's a Thanksgiving miracle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> It is so good to see you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in… I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, hi! How are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Thanks for having me over, you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Tag? Y-You're going?  Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Colorado.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, what good are you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Um, I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. </content></utterance>
