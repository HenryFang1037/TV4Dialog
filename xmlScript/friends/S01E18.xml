<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>...Yeah?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You are way off, pal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time—not any more. I just—I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?</content></utterance>
