<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do we pay for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Nah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And why do you care so much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You had fantasies about Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ahh.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What-what is love really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she’s gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I am a good kisser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>The Doctor</speaker><content>Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>The Doctor</speaker><content>No, I’m getting three separate heartbeats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>The Doctor</speaker><content>Doctors are wrong all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>The Doctor</speaker><content>Definitely. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>The Doctor</speaker><content>Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different from giving birth to one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What do you know?!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>Why would we be freaked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, back to happy. Back to happy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y’know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>No, Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>Yeah, y’know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y’know I figured y’know like I should y’know have like a career—and I love refrigerators!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You can’t give up on your dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. We’re-we’re gonna have three kids! And that’s-that’s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.</content></utterance>

Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.  Good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You put your fist through the wall?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I made fun of his accent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!</content></utterance>
