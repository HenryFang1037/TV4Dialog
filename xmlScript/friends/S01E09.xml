<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Terry</speaker><content>An advance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Terry</speaker><content>Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?  Oh, look at that.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, they're not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I am not wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, I just talked to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I'm calling Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What were you modeling for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know those posters for the city free clinic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know, the asthma guy was really cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you know which one you're gonna be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Good luck, man. I hope you get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, every single one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So you're free Thursday, then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. Oh, can I come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I thought it was $98.50.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I'm off to Carol's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi, is uh, is Carol here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>No, she's at a faculty meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>What's it look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Kinda like a big face without skin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Do you uh, do you talk about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, Rach, did you make your money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rach, here's your mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thanks, you can just put it on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> No, here's your mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thanks, you can just put it on the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Would you just open it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We all chipped in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> We did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> You owe me 20 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you. Thank you so much!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, I'm nine years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I hate this story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>We did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Yeah, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Really? You don't know what that means to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content> Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Yeah.  Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I just remembered, I have to do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>Um, leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So I guess you all saw it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Saw what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Tonight, on a very special Blossom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's closer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, you must stop shooping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler, will you just come in already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's not a question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, Mom never hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ok, all done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why would we do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>The balloon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I can't, I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Almost never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Got the keys? or Got the keys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Anytime you're ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Just aim for the bump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hello, baby. Hello, hello.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do either of you have the keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> The oven is on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I gotta get my ticket!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well then get it, get it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That tone will not make me go any faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That one will.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Hi, how's it goin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Shh!  Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Does it always, uh--?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>No, no that was the first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>Keep singing! Keep singing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Susan</speaker><content>I felt it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nope, not that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Can you go any faster with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> For an emergency just like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now. But I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I swear you said you had the keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why would I have the keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Aside from the fact that you said you had them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But I didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, you should have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.</content></utterance>

I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</content></utterance>
