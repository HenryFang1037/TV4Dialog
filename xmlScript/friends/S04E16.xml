<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah?  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of style—what did you throw away?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.  It’s a joke. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Bye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Right, I’ve got to be off, I’ll see ya. Buh-bye then. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes.  She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Why not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, that’s because of a lot of…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Y’know, they ruin it for everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Y’know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>No, no, no, she’s nice but, y’know, it just it made me realize that I’m just not, I’m just not ready to be dating, y’know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content> Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Then uh, what’s-what’s this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, what’ going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.  Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Awwww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Surprise!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler and Joey</speaker><content>Surprise!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>No one’s ever thrown me a surprise party before!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it was all Ross’s idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You really didn’t know?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What-what-what is so funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I said, "Like what?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now that’s a thinker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries.  Okay. Okay.  Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Care for a cherry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Oh, no thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>You okay?  You all right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> So we should probably get going soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>So why did you plan a party at the same time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>But Ross, I’m such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica said that did she? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A little salami.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Pastrami.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And lucky means, more cleavage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Does for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She was a welder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s not Christmas!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Or Spin the Bottle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>He’s not 11!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? You’re leaving?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, we have something we have to get to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Uhh, yeah, I think I’m going to take-off too.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What big thing?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther.  All right. Who wants to go first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>I’ll go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Welcome to America. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yay! Emily!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are the odds? What are the odds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, my turn!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Ohh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Just a bug.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, totally!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong,  do it right!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Feel better now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I eat a lot of meat right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—, actually I kinda want to see what happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.  What do I do now? What do I do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think you’re done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, time to take off the bra. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Take the bra off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, yeah! Real fun.  Y’know, this bra… Really, bothers me.  Y’know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Need uh, need a little hand there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ughhhh!! Forget it!  This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Well, what was supposed to happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can you not look at me when I say this?  I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Huh. Oh, boy!  Uhh, I-I don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Joshua</speaker><content>Because I-I like you.</content></utterance>
