<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe nobody's tried this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I wish all guys could be like him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Your mom was arrested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Shhh, busy beaming with pride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content> ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Now why would she say that's embarrassing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Shhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content> ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Awww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Jay Leno</speaker><content> Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content> Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...But a man can change. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyone want me to appraise anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. It's the one he's licking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>She's supposed to be with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Mrs. Bing</speaker><content>You are gonna be fine, believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-oh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you guys doing out here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross, how could you let this happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You don't think my mom's sexy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well... not in the same way...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, not playing raquetball!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He forgot to leave his grip size!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He didn't get the goggles!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well,sounds like you two have issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Goodbye, baby.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why would I tell him?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No.  No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How would I know? I-I wasn't here.</content></utterance>
