<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So he can't come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I am pretty wisdomous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So... what do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Listen, I hope... that you know...  I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!  Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Well, it matters to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I don't care, so you pick!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did you just hung up on me?  All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You don't know military time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Just subtract twelve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Six o'clock!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok. Hold on.  Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye.  Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ooh... she backed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She did? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I made her.  Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rehearse it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Thanks for coming you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh,  hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That is why!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Where is Emma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh... November?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I wanna say it's not looking good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, this is really awkward  Oh, and I can leave!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were, you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just, you just missed the cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>FOOTBALL!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I changed them. I, I sent you a fax about it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't have a fax machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know, I hate being left out of things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey guys, how is it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Who cares, AND?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I'll do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> M-Me, me, me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Please, you're going down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You are going downer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, hey, my pleasure.  So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I intend to marry her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>No more so than acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Strike two!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, what did you decide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I decided to pee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Mike didn't tell you? You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Goody, what is it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'll do it! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, it's 2100 hours.  Time for your toast. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Is that what you say to Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I...  oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because...  it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and  but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And... moment's over!  So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm...  Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS  OR THIS  OR THIS  OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS!  You know what? You're done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, happy my wedding day to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okie-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, this is a lot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You won awards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She's in her room, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What d'you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> YES, YES!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> Orchids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hello Michael.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Joseph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>May I have a word with you, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> This is... great...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Have a seat.  Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me...  I cannot allow this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>That must have been one lousy movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> That was ME!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right fine, I pick you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! We're gonna do it my way.  Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend.  Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm glad we had this little talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice.  That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God, what's it doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address.  Uh! What a pickle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.</content></utterance>
