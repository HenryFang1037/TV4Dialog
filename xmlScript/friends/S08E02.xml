<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed.  32 Joe. You’re 32! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"  Yeah, then you did that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you don’t have the cameras?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. Sorry man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No!  But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little guy  even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>A tiny salt shaker!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Or this one! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.  After you of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ew! No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?! I think he’s cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well then you have his baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Believe me I’m trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What was that bam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call!  I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on?  Is somebody pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah. That’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>David Lynn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?</content></utterance>
