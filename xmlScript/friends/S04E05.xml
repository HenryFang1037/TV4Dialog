<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I'm gonna go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Not your type?! She's gorgeous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, look, what do you want from me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am pretending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well then, do it better!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.</content></utterance>
