<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No we…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hormones.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, h-how is this like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Alrighty, here come the water works. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you might say, it’s a magic ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah, the stripper stole it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the cops!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not on you! On the stripper!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel, get the book! The book!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay!  Okay! Here!</content></utterance>
