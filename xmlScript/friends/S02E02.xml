<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>What is the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>What did you just do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>You won't even taste it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Hey, where is everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Judy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Julie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Jody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>You were with Julie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh. Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Yeah, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>That is not true!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-46"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-47"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-48"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-49"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-50"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>How did we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-51"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-52"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I did not freak out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-53"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Why'd you freak out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-54"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Because it's breast milk. It's gross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-55"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>My breast milk is gross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-56"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>This should be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-57"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-58"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-59"><speaker>CAROL</speaker><content>Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-60"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>That would be no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-61"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Come on. It doesn't taste bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-62"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-63"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>Cantaloupe juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-64"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-65"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>You've tasted it? You've tasted it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-66"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-67"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh, you've tasted it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-68"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-69"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-70"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Howdy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-71"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-72"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-73"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-74"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-75"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-76"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-77"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Yeah I guess you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-78"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-79"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I'm gonna do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-80"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-81"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>I don't know what else to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-82"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-83"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>I feel terrible, I really do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-84"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-85"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-86"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-87"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>It's that terrible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-88"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-89"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-90"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>I love you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-91"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-92"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-93"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>I'd do anything for you, you know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-94"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>I'd do anything for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-95"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, wait!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-101"><speaker>CUSTOMER</speaker><content>You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-102"><speaker>STORE GUY</speaker><content>Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-103"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-104"><speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker><content>My god, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-105"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-106"><speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-107"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>So.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-108"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-109"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-110"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Really? Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-111"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-112"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well, you're not totally paranoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-113"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>Oy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-114"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-115"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-116"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-117"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-118"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.</content></utterance>
