<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game. So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, you lied to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Achhh. It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.  Except with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! Open the door. What's going on? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What are you.. .  Why are you dressed like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, because, um.. . well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days. So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation. You know, like, "Hi, How do I look?"  "Really sexy. Could I BE any more turned on?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.  Whoa, whoa. Why are there two glasses of wine out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because.. . one of them is for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Cheers.  Okay, buh-bye. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know.  So, what's going on with you and Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, um.. . I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a.. . ah.. . little thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God! I love things. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little.. . um.. . eye-contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Eye-contact?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b.. . baby and a Ross.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?  I heard it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape. "</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?  I heard it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just.. . move on with my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really? You're moving on from Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone. So, you have to intercept all his calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I can't do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh give me , , ,  Hi, Mike? Hi. Listen. I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what? If you do this I.. . Phoebe will.. . do anything you want. Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.</content></utterance>
