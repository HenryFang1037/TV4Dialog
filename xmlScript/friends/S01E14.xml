<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Which one was Pete Carney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  "Was it good for you?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy.  "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>There's more beer, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, well, what kind of ritual?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Or?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Lorraine</speaker><content>You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> We can't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What? What can't you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Tell me it's "you and me" we.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok, you can not do this to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Lorraine</speaker><content> Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Excuse me.  How ya doin'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>So, do we have the best friends or what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>I will go for that drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Kristin</speaker><content> I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>That's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> It is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no, you see, actually it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, no I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I did, but...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Call me!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You did so. I swear, I swear— How long has she been in the bathroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>That could be it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, god.  You know, this is still pretty hot. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Oh, I love you too. But...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No but, no but.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's easy for you to say, you found one already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Not her.</content></utterance>
