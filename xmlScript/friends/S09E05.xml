<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thursday? But that's Halloween.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So spooky, that's all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Ugh, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma.  Which one of us should go to dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, Rachel! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, yay! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks, I'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That's fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together, the six of us, in such a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you talking about? We're all together right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, dear God!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>That's right. Is it true the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started by taking a look at last quarter's figures.  Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Claudia</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Claudia</speaker><content>Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright, look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine.  So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ken</speaker><content>I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I always liked you, Ken. </content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Trick or treat!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my threadbare robe that can't contain my breasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh. Oh wait!  you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>'kay, see you there. Happy humping!  Hey...hey!  Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all common areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You smoked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! I just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called leihalalokos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah, do you think, Monica's gonna be able smell it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No thanks, I'm good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> OK, so you wanna play it that way, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Right. You know what? Actually I just got off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You don't need a shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What do I smell?  I smell smoke. Hon, did you smoke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two packs...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But, those are for you.</content></utterance>

The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip, swirling around in the whirl pool that fills the apartment.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe we should just eat now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>You can't order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, OK, what's the restaurant's policy about people eating that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>Strange man.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That was a celebration of life! Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want our baby to be conceived?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, you're right. We shouldn't do it like this. Huh. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, it's not the end of the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You mean it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, blah blah blah blah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can't believe it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You tricked me to get me into bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's right, I got mine.</content></utterance>

Risotto with the shaped truffels and the roasted rip steak with the golden ??? and a Bordelaise sauce, unless any of that stuff I just said means snails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>It doesn't.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How come you didn't get a bigger table? ...You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica.  I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-34"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content> I'll give you another minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why are you going?  He said she wanted the shrew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You guys ever heard the story about when Ross's mom went to the beauty salon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You mean the willie story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh-huh, they already know it! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-40"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-41"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-43"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler, control your woman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-44"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-45"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Aw ... what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-46"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, no, Emma dropped her sock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-47"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-48"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-49"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's a good toast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-50"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Could you please get her attention?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-51"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mommy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-52"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh, for god's sake,  Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!  I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.  Well, it's too late now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-53"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I don't think that's us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-54"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-55"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Well, what is going on with you two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-56"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Um, you see, I'm ovulating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-57"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-58"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-59"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-60"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So? You had sex, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-61"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-62"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Okay, that was Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-63"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-64"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Huh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, okay, I'm gonna take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-65"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-66"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-67"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-68"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know, I think that's a good idea. Our babysitter just pounded down another Chardonnay. Bye, you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-69"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-70"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>See ya. Well, this is just us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-71"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-72"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-73"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do, you gonna go do it now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-74"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We don't have much time. Once the egg decends into the ovaries ..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-75"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-76"><speaker>Waiter</speaker><content>I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-77"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nah, just me. All alone.  Dinner for six for one, huh.  You boys are about to see something really special.</content></utterance>
