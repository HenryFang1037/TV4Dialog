<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross, did you really read all these baby books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You knew about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Aw, I know all about Kip!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.</content></utterance>
