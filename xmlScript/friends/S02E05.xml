<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>You ever figure out what that thing's for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>JADE</speaker><content>Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>JADE</speaker><content>I got a little drunk...and naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Bob here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>JADE</speaker><content>Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh my god. You are pure evil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>For Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>For Ross, Ross, Ross.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>If it's not you, this is a horrible story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Go over there and tell that woman the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Whoever stood you up is a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>JADE</speaker><content>How did you--?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>JADE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Charity.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Actually, it makes us feel that big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Why did you look at me when you said that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Well, I guess now we can't go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>You know what? You're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
