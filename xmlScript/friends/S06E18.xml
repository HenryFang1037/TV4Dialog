<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Who wrote it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, is that against the rules?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, but it is frowned upon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Besides, there’s a big age difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What’s a Movement class?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Uh, I’m a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That was you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over; you’re not my teacher anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What time?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay?  I warned her about those candles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler, is that… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh that’s great! Good for you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Elizabeth</speaker><content>Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Umm, no. No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Gum!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don’t use a curling iron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can smell it a little, bake the pie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire.  No-no, it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is…  Uhh… Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age.   A concept lost on some people!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So it’s okay to date a student.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. What-what should I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey that is so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I couldn’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You couldn’t do it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! You’re going out with her again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Going out with who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, Dana Keystone from college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, that was Dana Caplin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>The Guys</speaker><content>Ohhhh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey! You didn’t even know her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah whatever!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no—Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Of course!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Ohh, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well maybe there is one thing you can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>What?! Anything! Anything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Dana</speaker><content>Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. </content></utterance>
