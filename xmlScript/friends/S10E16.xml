<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Just flip!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Damnit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's all done!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, so you've done some good work!  What about your carry-ons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, well. Everything that I need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where's your passport?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It should be right next to my plane ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Here, let me help you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey Erica, welcome back to town!  Wow, look how big you've gotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>That's because I'm pregnant!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right, no, I understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, I knew .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, it takes two incomes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you guys doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Try it, I can't feel a thing! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We're taking a break!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>From?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Jumping on the bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You guys hear a ringing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What the hell is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I didn't know Monica had these!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! Where's Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah? Yeah, where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rock on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, where's Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Everybody</speaker><content>Hey Rach, hey you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Here she is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What did I just say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come here, I'll make you a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose.  Wait a minute...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, Joe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I've been better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm gonna miss you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  but I do have something for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, oh. . What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you talking about? These aren't mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel used to live in that room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey's bare ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>. Well played.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I love you Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I love you too.  Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok. Monica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can you come here with me for a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Are you wearing waterproof mascara?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, you're so screwed. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey. What was that all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you kidding? Oh my God...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> You're the best friend I ever had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I... I... I... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That is so sweet. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I really made you think about that thing uh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Pheebs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think these are yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Can I talk to you alone for a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Where do you think Mike really is? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh honey...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Oh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> So, I guess you're next. You're ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>All</speaker><content>No, no, no, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, here we go...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh...  Well...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I think I'm gonna take off. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? I don't get a goodbye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Lucky bastard!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, it needs to be plicit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. Mine too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Mine was a humdinger</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?  NOT FROM YOU! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And say what? "You owe me a goodbye",</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>THE HELL I DO!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't get a goodbye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...  IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I hope Ross isn't too upset.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Phoebe and Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's what it seemed like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine, then why didn't you say something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach!</content></utterance>
