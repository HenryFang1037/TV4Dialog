<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler and Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Rachel's at work.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, what's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Eeeee--ohh!! God! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How come? Everybody else does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>You can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> This is all of your things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>I'll take it all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>After what I did? Can you blame her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Now calm down Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I want the little round waffles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right.  Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Arghhhh!!!!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'll take it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That might work! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What's the matter Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you're really okay with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He's not even here!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You guys! You guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, you fogged Danny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Yesss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>O-kay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! That guy is so rude!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well you did a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I totally forgive you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Crematorium Chris? Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This is fashion?!  Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny.  Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good?  'Cause I do.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, rocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We all hate Emily!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nooo!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>God, I feel so guilty about Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I kinda feel like it's my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I think it's very brave what you said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!  Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Yeti—I mean Danny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Danny</speaker><content>The pizza-place across the street any good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
