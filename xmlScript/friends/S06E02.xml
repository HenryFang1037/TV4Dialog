<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey Rach!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too…" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "…go to the bathroom." He may think I’m sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Stephanie</speaker><content>Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, what about you?  Wouldn’t you want a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Karin</speaker><content>Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Whatever! What about you Meg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Meg</speaker><content>Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> She said, "He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth——Nothing!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Meg</speaker><content>Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Karin</speaker><content>I am so attracted to him right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, Joey’s my best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m not your best friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.  Oh yes. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Are you pregnant?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Um-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Russell</speaker><content>I see. Have you considered therapy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think just the annulment for today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Russell</speaker><content>There are a couple of forms to fill out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Russell</speaker><content>Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t know.  Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Something to remember me by!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you okay? You’re not blinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What is the matter with you?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What’s hard to believe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It is? Really?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.</content></utterance>
