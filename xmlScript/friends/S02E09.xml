<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Oh God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>GRANDMOTHER</speaker><content>It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?</content></utterance>
