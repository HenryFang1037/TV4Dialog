<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, NO!  Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>I uhm... I completely understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright, I'm gonna go find them...  I just need a... need a before I can... you know.  Grandma... grandma... grandma...  Okay, I see you later.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That's not nonchalant!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No idea what it means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh... okay, just hide!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know where Joey is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>...I really don't... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Can I talk to you for a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, sure... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't believe this... Have you guys been...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Uh-huh... right... yeah...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-58"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-59"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-60"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-61"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-62"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-63"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You would think!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-64"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-65"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Is he gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-66"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> How are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-67"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Pssst...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-68"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-69"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Now, what is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-70"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-71"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-72"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, he's with Charlie now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-73"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-74"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You're a pain in my ass, Geller!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-75"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-76"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-77"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sure...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-78"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Enunciate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-79"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Get out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-80"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are they right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-81"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-82"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-83"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-84"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Although...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-85"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I like although!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-86"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-87"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-88"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-89"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-90"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-91"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm thinking about you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-92"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-93"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Let's forget about Ross...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-94"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Forgotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-95"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-96"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Nothing...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-97"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-98"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-99"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, maybe I can help. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-100"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-101"><speaker>Both</speaker><content>Yeah</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-102"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-105"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-106"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dude! You're not taking your Bible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-107"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-108"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Learn about Jesus...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-109"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-110"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>So, did you talk to Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-111"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-112"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-113"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Stop it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-114"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>PHD</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-115"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're filthy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-116"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, have you guys seen Monica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-117"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-125"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-126"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>It's so... something... You go girlfriend!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-127"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You've never said that in your life, have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-128"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Not once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-129"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I thought so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-130"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And listen to this... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-131"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-132"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-133"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-134"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-135"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-136"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I understand...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-137"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I'll do it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-138"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-139"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-140"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-141"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Aaah... you're not good at this...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-142"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You don't have to go home tonight, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-143"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-144"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-145"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-146"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-147"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-148"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I have a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-149"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You have a... You have a date? With who?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-152"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-153"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>For how long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-154"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-155"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-156"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-157"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-158"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-159"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Charlie</speaker><content>Okay... Good luck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Still nervous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm gonna get the lasagna.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You kissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I saw you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah... Now I have something...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh... uh... look... before you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I am those things, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I can't think of anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So you eh, you talked to Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, so everything's okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I'm so excited about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really? Excited?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hi, Mike's place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey, it's Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-52"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, that was fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-53"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-54"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-55"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-56"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-60"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I... I'm Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-61"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-62"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Enchanté </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-63"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-64"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You go back to work tomorrow night, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-65"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-66"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-67"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this.  You like that, right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-68"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you singing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-69"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's "Bolero" from "10".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-70"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-71"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You what? You said you liked them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-72"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-73"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-74"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-75"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  OUCH!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-76"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hit yourself in the tooth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-77"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And the eye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-78"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you.  Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-79"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-80"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-81"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-82"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay, shoot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-83"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-84"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> OH NO!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-85"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-86"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, major shampoo explosion!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-87"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-88"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-89"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-90"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-91"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-92"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-93"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-94"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Duh, you think? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-95"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-96"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-97"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-98"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>My name is Precious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-99"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-100"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>I just can't believe this... Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-101"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I don't...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-102"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-103"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-104"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-105"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-106"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, not a fan of the tough love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-107"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-108"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-109"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-110"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-111"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-112"><speaker>Precious</speaker><content>Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-113"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You're welcome!</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I have a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You can't move at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, well, I can move... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I guess so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Some of these look a little frayed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, did you err... did you tell Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! Good night! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Goo--ood night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Good night! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Seriously, good night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Stop saying good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sure, what do you have in mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really? I don't really feel like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is what I want to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.</content></utterance>
