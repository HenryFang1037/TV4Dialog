<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you talking about?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean, way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay guys, way to wish me luck!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Good luck! Go get 'em! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, great so do you want to do it together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I would love to do it together!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>They're gonna do it together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Dude! That's my girlfriend!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What, so I gotta shut it down now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Weirder than watching his two moms make out? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're not his godfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?! Are you kidding?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Of course I am!  Okay, let's go godfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really? That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content> Hey, that kid looks familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, you look nothing like Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I look more like him than you do! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Nancy</speaker><content>She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh, what a fun office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content> Rachel? Do you smoke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That doesn't seem fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, it is the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh wait, I change my mind!  Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, me too! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, look at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What happened to the intimate dinner party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Cups.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And ice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?  All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! How'd the audition go?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's  "Audition didn't go so well.  Yeah it did?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You got a callback too didn't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah I did!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>So anyway we really…  Honey, we're just smoking all over you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Oh that's great! You are the best!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?  Y'know what, actually…  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Nancy</speaker><content>I thought you didn't smoke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>We get high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, me too.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Who knows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content> Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>The Casting Director</speaker><content>Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two  or you two.  </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Kyle</speaker><content>Yeah. It's gonna be weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Kyle</speaker><content>Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, cups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Seriously that's a lot of cups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What's up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, you just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? Chandler! Tell 'em!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>At least I care about his feelings!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And why wouldn't he get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You just give him a spoon baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You're kid's name is Raymond!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's so gross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think, sub-consciously…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There you go. Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thank you! So, did-did he get it?</content></utterance>
