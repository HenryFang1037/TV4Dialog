<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,  ‘the movie star.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper.

<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You gave her food poisoning!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that is so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean?  I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s a little clearer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Ginger</speaker><content>It’s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: ‘How much it bothers you?’ because I don’t like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. No. I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Ginger</speaker><content>Okay. It’s just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Ginger</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s-that’s my nubbin.</content></utterance>
