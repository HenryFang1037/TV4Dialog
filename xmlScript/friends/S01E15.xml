<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mrs. Tedlock</speaker><content>Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Never mind. But it was going to be really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>All</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>All</speaker><content>That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So.... I quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So was it a lot more money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>... the WENUS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh. That WENUS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So what're you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Um... hi there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yeah, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, what kind of food is he looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>OK.  Oh Monica! Guess what!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can you see my nipples through this shirt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Career counselor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I love my life, I love my life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh! Brian's Song!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>The meeting with the guy went great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What are you going to make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yummy noises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> And Monica, what are you going to make?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?  You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who are you going out with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, is this the bug lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So what are you guys going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And he's not speaking metaphorically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Celia</speaker><content>I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright... </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> OK, try this salmon mousse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Mmmm. Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is it better than the other salmon mousse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's creamier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, well, is that better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>My God! What happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Well.... it is amouz-ing...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hello?  Oh, hi Wendy!  Yeah, eight o'clock.  What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?...  OK, great.  All right, I'll see you then. Bye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ten dollars an hour for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Waitressing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But, but?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.  Amouz-bouche? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Celia</speaker><content>Talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Celia</speaker><content>No no no. Talk... dirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Wha... what, here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Celia</speaker><content>Yes...</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Vulva?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Please be kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>OK.  I'm in my apartment...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>....yeah... what else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Alright, look, I'll start, OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Alright, now you say something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I... ahem... I really don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on! You like this woman, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You want to see her again, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thank you Helen, that'll be all.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Done.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Steve</speaker><content>You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.</content></utterance>
