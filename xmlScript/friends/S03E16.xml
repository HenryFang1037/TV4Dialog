<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, there’s banana on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So then you know? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, good. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Now what is Fabutec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Waxine!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes! Have you seen it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>They have the best stuff in there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh my God! Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, but don’t you think....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What trail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Was it not pain-free?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You took my watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chloe</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chloe</speaker><content>Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chloe</speaker><content>Oh, well I tell Issac everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>You dog!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Actually, no, we’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>Yeah, we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, we’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>Yeah, we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, we’re not!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>Okay, we’re not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>But, we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Issac</speaker><content>I can promise not to tell her again.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Jasmine</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Jasmine</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thank you, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Jasmine</speaker><content>But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yes I would.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you actually saying these words?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, now you’re not even taking to me?  Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind.

</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s what?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="44-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t.  I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No Ross!!  Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="44-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, what the hell did I know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you.  Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach,  and, and....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.</content></utterance>
