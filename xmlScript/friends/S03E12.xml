<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hmm? Oh, yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> It must take you forever to find your keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich? Why don't you get a magician?!</content></utterance>
