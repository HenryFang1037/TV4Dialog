<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What is the matter with you?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! Barry and Mindy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why did they get divorced?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Which time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure I would!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>All</speaker><content> Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I just think Monica was that fat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Merrill Lynch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well why didn’t you take the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh yeah? Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you.  Okay, let’s go see Monica!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Wow!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh dear God, let me think. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh no! What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Was his question what’s more boring than him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ehh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s an idea!  Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I could use the money; it could give me time to write.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh right great! Welcome aboard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Phoebe! Guess what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude.  Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I don’t know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?  Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.  Nah! Umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk?  Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.</content></utterance>
