<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh-oh, you lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What you don’t think I’d go up to her?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Aren’t you with that girl over there? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>I’m sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>It’s laminated!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-33"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>Y'know it’s ironic...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>Isabella</speaker><content>...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. </content></utterance>
