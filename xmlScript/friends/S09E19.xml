<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry, good luck! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Director</speaker><content>On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> The big apple!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Check again please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>I'm sorry, it's not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>I don't know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> She doesn't know what to say!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Just give us the cheapest room you have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's insane!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if... if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?  We'll take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What! ? They are totally ripping us off!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Dude, you're shaking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ehhh, aw!  . Well, that's new!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?  Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What did you get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>USA Today</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nice, put it with the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And I also got... two more apples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We are four short of a bush-o  . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, that's not cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandlers</speaker><content>Dude, none of this is cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt  I wish I'd thought this through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think I know what you mean though... the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs  ... oh, you already got that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok, how about this  ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, but the batteries...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Thank you, thank you very much!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Let's celebrate with some maple candy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>At least tell me where you hid it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, well this is like that... in no way. I had a... I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What do you think brought than on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>A love scene? With who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Olivia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So do you think that my dream means anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You took the same class twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It was hard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Rachel and Monica</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!  Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh... Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back  .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, we're still on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I didn't say your songs were not good enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Tiny portions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it"!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, it's not about quantity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well... it's not about quality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are people having, the garlic Martini?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There's something new in the bowl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, we have enough, just walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, but I want... I want the pinecones!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>There's a forest right outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's not the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok, go quick!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Thank you for a delightful stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, my maple candy!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ok, you have to stop playing now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Wow... definitely just Drake...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh... I don't think it's going very well...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What... that scene I saw was so good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So... I've never played that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh... well... just once... with you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok... this could be a little awkward... I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What the hell are you talking about? ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Joey, you never.. you never talked about that before...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she... is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Thanks dude!!! This is GREAT!!! </content></utterance>
