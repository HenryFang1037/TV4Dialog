<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The one that always stares at me when I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well, why don’t you set us up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well that’s great! Congratulations!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.  A year ago..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t think mine likes me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Maybe it’s a universal thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah let’s head off to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We should go.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married?  No, yeah, I should.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Janine</speaker><content>Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place a little nicer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What???</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am proud of all my friends today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him?  Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>To get you to make out with him!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohhh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white.  Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What??</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. I am not putting on makeup. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me?  OH!! Demon!! Demon!!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear.  I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No thanks, Josephine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, hi, Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Hi Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>That’s not true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Hi Ralph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Kim</speaker><content>Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Hillary</speaker><content>And after that, what could I do except become a chef.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mmm-Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Hillary</speaker><content>And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Hillary</speaker><content>You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mm-Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Hillary</speaker><content>After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hmm-Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Hillary</speaker><content>I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mmm-Unmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Hillary</speaker><content>Come on. I want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohh, I love birds. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What is the matter with you ?!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You’re arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You’re turning into a women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.</content></utterance>
