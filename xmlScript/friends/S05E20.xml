Okay, bye.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, no one talks like that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, I'm more cop than you two!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How do you figure that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Umm, jealous! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, no problem. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Ross!</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Nooo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! We can't do that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't think he's the one who needs help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.   Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?!  Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Answering Machine</speaker><content>Your messages have been erased.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Noooooooo!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>No. But that reminds me,  sign this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? What? What? What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.  Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> You okay man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Thank Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, HELLO!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I guess we should go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, wait. Wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah right! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah well unless we tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right?</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> John Glenn is here?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>No, Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My God, Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> It was a car backfire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I didn't know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who jumps at loud noises!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! I could've died tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I do have a newfound respect for life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh my God! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content> So you wanna get some dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Gary</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Is something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You dove in front of Ross! Ross!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What picture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>From a bullet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know it doesn't make much sense…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Much sense?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you risked your life, for a sandwich!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! What? What happened?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And somebody took a shot at me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because a car backfired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay, why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You talked to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, she left a message.   But it-it kinda got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, okay, what-what did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.   Your decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, there you go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Close call day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, thanks Rach. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-39"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> "Hey Ross, it's you!"  Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-41"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey umm, was-was Monica here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-43"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-44"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I want my money back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-45"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Before or after you were shot by your own troops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, hero sandwiches. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.  But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.   Not you Joey.</content></utterance>
