<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Right! And when is that due?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>First of the month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And that’s every month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, just the months you actually want to live here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ahhh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, here is the phone bill. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh my God!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s not charity, Joe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>This is how much we pay for electric?!!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, yeah.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, how much do you think he needs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well that would help the pride thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And also, my birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s not your birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Pheebs, I was wondering…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well and clearly not a minute sooner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Surprise!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You’re plans were with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay!  Oh my God, thank you!!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I thought you said you were going to do nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, but for the last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay fine, now Ross…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, but-but I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I’ve got Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because, because I’ve got Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He’s at a dinner party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I gotta go make a fake Ben.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes it would. What do you say to $50?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, you’re on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You remember when we got these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I guess you weren’t there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time…  You don’t remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m gonna miss you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don’t think there’s anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come on, there’s gotta be something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Nope, she’s perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good! Great! You can go first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You get your messages!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Great! It worked! No one’s sad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a loooot of electricity!  Whoo-ho-ho!  I gotta buy some food.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! No! No! No——one can beat me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh, your brother. Score!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, put him on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what else I’m not gonna miss? "I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>"Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>"I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! I call her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>"Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Nah, not my game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know, I took it hard too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys… STOP!!  I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No Phoebe I am mad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, deep-deep-deep down!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, what did you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh,  wow, 700.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Not 700 exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Double it! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Monica and Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh really? Like what Monica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah, good start Mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She lets you borrow them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold!  She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.</content></utterance>
