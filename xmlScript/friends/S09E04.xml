<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Thank you. Can you believe no one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>People.  So why you all dressed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh umm. Mike's picking me up for a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh yea? Now um, how is that going, is it getting serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh I dunno, I dunno, you know I mean, I like him but am I ready to take my grade-A loins off the meat market?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know, I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy. I'm always like, is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you know, you are a bit of a drama queen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But you, you're so much better off. You just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terms into anything serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I wouldn't say never, you know. There's that guy ... well what about...OK well there's gotta be someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There isn't. That's what I'm saying.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can't believe I never realized this before. I'm in my 30s and never been in a long-term relationship! Oh my God!  What's wrong with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, no there's nothing wrong with you. I mean, you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I wanna get married! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Please don't cry because of me, Pheebs. I don't know what I'm talking about. I've been divorced three times!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>At least you've been married! Oh my God! I wanna trade lives with Ross! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really, great, did I actually ask you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Hayley</speaker><content>No, that's just where you were going. I just figured that I'd help you out, you don't seem like the kind of guy that does this a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Ha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Seriously Gunther, you should see someone about that cold. If it gets much worse you could DIE! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So how'd the date go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it was awful! Every time I thought about what you said, I started crying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So he hasn't called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Would you call this girl?  Thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Now I feel terrible, this is all my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, you know what you should feel terrible about? This could have been my serious guy! He was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We are a rare breed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Hayley</speaker><content>What a great dinner.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do you have any cake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> So this is going pretty good. Dinner was nice, got a lot in common.  Victoria's secret, huh, we even like the same books. Oh now there's a scary painting. Wait a minute! I think I've been scared by that painting before. You know what, this whole place look familiar! I have definitely been in this apartment! I know I've seen this weird plant before  ouch! It did that the last time! Oh my God, I've gone out with this girl before! Yeah, we had sex on this couch and then on that chair and...no, we didn't do it here, which is weird because it seems like a perfectly good place.  ouch! That's why.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Sure.  Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I really, really need to talk to you about something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>OK, unless... you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh, it's just you have that look</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Damn super cuts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>What's up? Is Phoebe OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh no, yeah, no, Phoebe is great, but umm... I'm an idiot. Look, right before you guys went out, I accidentally got her all upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>That's why she was weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, yeah, I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person! Please don't blow her off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I'm not blowing her off. I actually just got off the phone with her. We're going out tomorrow night. I mean, I hope that's OK with you, stranger from the coffee house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well then, I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Hey wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said? Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Of course she has. If she'd never had a serious relationship, I'd go around broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>But you did say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, yes I did. And I will also say what I'm about to say vis-a-vis the following, Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her...super-serious relationship with...Vicrum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Vicrum?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What, that's a real name!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plain...STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o'clock, maybe I'll hit the gym.  Who am I kidding? Pay-per-view porn!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do not disturb! Do not disturb!  Monica!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is everything all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm gonna go freshen up, OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>OK honey.... That was close.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Rach, its me, OK, I just got to Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that couldn't have been pretty. But you know, guys do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah well, the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Noooooo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that? Believe me, I know what he was doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Man, sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Which means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah! You know what honey? Guys are just different. They like things that we can't understand. You know, I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Eww, are you talking about my bother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I didn't disguise that very well, did I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date, I realized I already slept with her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So basically, you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But you don't remember sleeping with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, but she should remember sleeping with me! I am very memorable, you guys know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What, how do we know, we never slept with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And who's fault is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! I never have an off night, OK, although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy, but even then I'm better than most!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, why don't you just let it go and ask her out again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, you're both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with! You're made for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Interesting. All right, I'll go out with her again and try to get past it  Oh salt, bloaty!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You don't think sharks are sexy do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No.  Wait a minute, what was the little mermaid?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! Mike called, we're going out again! Yay yay! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yay! Quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What? Wha-wha-what did you do, Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh boy, you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me, blah blah blah, and I ended up telling him ...that....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Umm... that you had a six-year-long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What? Why!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, he seemed too bummed out that you'd never been in a serious relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum. He's a kite designer! And he used to date Oprah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm not going along with some lie you made, Ross. No I'm just gonna be honest with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Good, yeah, just be honest with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I've nothing to be ashamed of. OK, so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. OK, I haven't had a real boyfriend. You know, if he can't handle that, he can leave. Which he will, and that's OK. So I'll just be alone forever, you know, alright, I'll be... it'll be fine, it'll be fine. I'll go on walking tours with widows and lesbians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> You know, I'm trying to think of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there. Phoebe, are you OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh huh yeah. There's just something umm, there's something you should know.... Vicrum just called.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Hayley</speaker><content>So it was kind of a shock. After 25 years of marriage, my parents, a perfect couple, getting divorced. I kinda took it the hardest 'cause I was the youngest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Hayley</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How could you not remember that we slept together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Hayley</speaker><content>What! When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I dunno!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Hayley</speaker><content>I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on, come on, search your brain. All right. it was ... a certain amount of time ago, I was here, you were here, we had sex  here, here, here NOT there. Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Hayley</speaker><content>No, it's not ringing any bells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>My God, woman! How many people do you have to have been with not to remember any of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me. Hey! I still got it.  So we're good.  I'll let myself out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>...and I said Vicrum, you can't just call every time you get lonely, you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah well  yeah you know, Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>That is so wrong and on top of that he's a glue sniffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know but he calls and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth-talking free-lance kite designer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>I just think there's somebody better out there for you,  I mean I'm not saying me but...maybe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>And you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. Although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway, I just think I can make you happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>OK I can't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so...if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eyes, make it less awkward  You kissed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So you don't think I'm a total freak</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>No. Well look, can I think you're weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I guess so, can I, can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Definitely</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> This is Vicrum.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I'm not quite sure you got the right movie, that's all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh well, this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Does what always have to be sharks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Honey, look, we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sweetie it's OK, I still love you, let me be a part of this.</content></utterance>
