<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said "No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony, even though there were NO LIGHTS !</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So are you gonna...talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know I...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me. And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental Potluck dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why did I get married?!</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I should have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well it depends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>On...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>On how far along he's in the sex change process!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to, your eyebrows are...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh man! I have to get those done too?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! Talking about high maintenance</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey hey! You dye your hair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm a woman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Arghhh! Double standards!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Only if I don't have to get up and sing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's just, I'm not good at singing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>While drinking...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You kissed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I thought you hated him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't know what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right let's just do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Sonia</speaker><content>We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face! I'm all right! I'm all right! Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK  Dammit! Woman! How Hoooow!</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times, two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Did she go out with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah! The high road...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there! Hey come with me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you trying to get everybody divorced?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, so they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I thought I had to make the jokes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Don't you have to be at work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop! Swoop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: "Would you... would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Blonde girl</speaker><content>Sorry...we were just leaving</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We still got it!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Gavin! I brought you some soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I heard you were sick...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no no no</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>So I had fun last night</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So did I</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's just a cold</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>What's Ross doing to you on that picture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.  Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Yeah! But you said not to worry about...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right, right, yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Don't panic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly. Gavin come out from behind that curtain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Molly</speaker><content>Hello! I just go and get Emma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>So hum...Why did I have to hide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I thought it was Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>There isn't. There is totally isn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a rodeo clown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in any relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so much history...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>I think you should talk to Ross about all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>Don't be. It's just bad timing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So seriously...rodeo clown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>Gavin</speaker><content>One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth singing "I touch myself"...I'm not here to judge!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No I told you I can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What have you heard me sing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All the time when you're cooking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah I do rock that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Well I've got a book around...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>"Delta Dawn"</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You already hit on me an hour ago</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>By drowning or...?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Michelle</speaker><content>Why would he break up with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Her friend</speaker><content>I don't know sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Michelle</speaker><content>All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica singing "Delta Dawn".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn" "Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Can you totally see through her shirt ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I may be a sissy but I can still pound you into the ground. All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one eyebrow and now... they don't match!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so I don't look stupid for my pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok. First of all, this is green!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What the hell am I supposed to do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What, what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his "business" partners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymore plucking. It hurts so bad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that one shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why didn't I get that message?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-39"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I never gave it to you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one Who moved on and didn't tell anyone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-49"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us?

You know what, it's not, because it works for us!?But you know this doesn't work. In fact this is the opposite of working!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-50"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, clearly.</content></utterance>
