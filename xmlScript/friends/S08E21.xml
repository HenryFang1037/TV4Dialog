<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.  I didn’t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though.  "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow! How do you know how to do that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s what I do now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You cooked him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."</content></utterance>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>…also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>You must’ve had your hands full.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>So let’s talk a little bit about your duties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> My duties?  All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>Now you’ll be heading a whole division, so you’ll have a lot of duties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>But there’ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Good to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>We can go into detail…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>All right then, we’ll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you’ll fit in well here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.  Duties.  Duties!  Poo. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>The Interviewer</speaker><content>Poo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! You’re back from your date!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little slutty, but who isn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I liked her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t want you to date her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Why? What, what are you jealous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Do you feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Wow! I don’t know, maybe. I’m…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around!  Like you did last night when I had to pee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No that’s just——That’s just ‘cause I’m such a good messer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-40"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
