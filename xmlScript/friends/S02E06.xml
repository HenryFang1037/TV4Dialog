<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Really? From who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>KID</speaker><content>Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah. Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>KID</speaker><content>Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No. But I remember people telling me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I hope Ben has a little sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?</content></utterance>
