<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! You cleaned!  Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, it wasn’t you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well then who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I got a maid. Yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did she really say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Fine, I can do it.  Whew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Uh listen, I just—I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh you did?  He did it! He did it!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Shhh! I’m talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who…eats lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Yeah uh…okay. I’m-I’m sorry. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You’re moving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be,  "How you doin’?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So does-does Joey know you’re moving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s not really porn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Not so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah that would really be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. No. No you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, thank God!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in  the laundry room. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know I would it’s just painful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So she’s really not dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where’d you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>Okay. Uhh, I’m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I’ll clean behind the refrigerator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Brenda</speaker><content>I’ll be back in a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>See? I told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She stole my jeans!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She must’ve been planning this for years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just…I got so angry just looking at her……face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.  Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I just…when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Maybe this is too weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>No wait! There’s only a problem when I look at you.  Oh I got it! I got it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No don’t tear out your eyes!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, yeah try that.  So, is that better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Not really. You…you’re blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You’re Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe…If I-if I just don’t look at you for a while.  See? It…it works. I’m not, I’m not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Look Eric, turn around.  Look, I like you, but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and……second kisses. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I was kinda hoping you’d stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big.  Y’know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here.  Or-or-or we could put it right here.  Aw, it’s cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here.  You wouldn’t even notice it. Where’s the baby? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y’know I blame Ross for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I do too a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Oh no, stay here we’ll keep doing this. I’ll pay you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because I put my head between her legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>To see her pants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They’re my pants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you sure? Did you see the stain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Fine.  She’s wearing my bra!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh dear God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Here’s another plan…No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I fear a jury will see it the same way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you see this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You need new clothes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi. How is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh.  Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh I don’t know that it would.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Our sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>We didn’t have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>Well if I didn’t have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content> Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Eric</speaker><content>No-no it’s not! I don’t want to lose you! It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.</content></utterance>
