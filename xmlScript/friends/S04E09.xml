<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, I had sex in high school.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content> Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can’t stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Really? Well, in that case…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>That’s fine, actually I’m on the hiring committee, so there’ll be at least one friendly face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh! That’s great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>No-ho-ho!  Yeah.  I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don’t you worry, I’m sure with your qualifications you won’t need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I, umm…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Kidding! God, I feel wild today!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, I’ll see you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler and Ross</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Somewhere maybe along the equator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hello.   It’s Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Stupid, useless Canadian money!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Mr. Posner</speaker><content>You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?  It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Mrs. Lynch</speaker><content>I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It’s amazing how she gets it right almost every time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Mr. Posner</speaker><content>Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, I realize that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content> And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I love working with designers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, look at my on the back page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, okay!  "Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure, but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."  Wow! You really laid into this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh! Do you need me to go with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Haven’t we made this decision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, all right. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Bye!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content>Why? So you could hang up on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content>Just give me a chance too…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content> I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content>Well our service is not grossly incompetent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content>Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content>Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content> Lebanon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content>How long is this gonna take? ‘Cause I got another critic to go yell at.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>I thought it went very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about.  Now, just to brief you…  I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Rachel, please, don’t make a scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>There’s nobody here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Sophie, get in here!  You see! Now you’re making Sophie uncomfortable!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Sophie</speaker><content>She’s not making me uncomfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Do you want me to quit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>What?! What would make you think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk,  and I will be gone by the end of the day!  Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it’s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>My drinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Oh, I must’ve said that after you left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Said what? Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it! I don’t want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Say more things like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’d need an expense account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Done!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And an assistant.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How sad are we?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Joey and Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Chandler and Ross</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I’m hearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Or! A bakery delivery person.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception.  Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van.  Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Mrs. Lynch</speaker><content>Oh my goodness! You haven’t heard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Heard what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Mrs. Lynch</speaker><content>Joanna passed away last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! How?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Mrs. Lynch</speaker><content>Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Mrs. Lynch</speaker><content>No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Mrs. Lynch</speaker><content> No, I’m sorry. I have to go. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Sophie</speaker><content> Good morning!</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Allesandro</speaker><content>I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we’re gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Umm, I just wanna say, uh  that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe...  Are you gonna kill me?</content></utterance>
