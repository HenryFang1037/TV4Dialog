<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don’t use the words old or downhill or  they still look pretty damn good. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>They do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chocolate-chip pancakes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We’ve got presents!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Good ones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old!  Why are you doing this to us?! </content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re roommate is a soap opera star.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Come on, let’s have some fun. Huh?  What do you want to do today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How hot do I look in this, huh?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t believe you bought this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really! God Ross, what were you thinking?  I know it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Get out, get out of my apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Least of all you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>Why? What you’d do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content> You’ve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!  And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>It’s older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What about your breath?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. I can do that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica’s a little drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yay! I love drunk Monica!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Awwwww… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Go change!  She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica’s wasted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Maybe that will liven up this party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay, will you just go help her change please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yep. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content> This one’s from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ahh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Tag</speaker><content>It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> A scooter! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, read the card! Read the card!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.  Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.  All our love Monica and Chandler.  That’s funny, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no-no-no! That was the joke!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, because you’re not a grandmother!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All you had to do was buy the card!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really! That long?!   Look all you want, it’s happening!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Will you quit hoggin’ it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> How are you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I really wish that you wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Pheebs!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Speech! Come on Monica!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Come on! Speech!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content> Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Mrs. Geller</speaker><content>Oh-ho, I think it’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think it’s necessary. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Wooo!! Hoo!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I really like to say that I’m-um…  Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!!  That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!!  And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Okay quick, help me get this off! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah!!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. </content></utterance>
