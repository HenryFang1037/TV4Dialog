<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Now, have you told anyone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can’t think of anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I guess it could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well then I think that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Nope! That never happened to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hm-mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here  you can see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Oh, I couldn’t eat now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Chicken?  Chicken boy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Oh Rachel, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you. It’s just that, when those gates open, you…  Hard to close ‘em. But they are closed now. Believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared.  And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>I would really like that. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>That was…so good. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>There he is! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, okay.  Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Customer</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It is your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Customer</speaker><content>Do you know who at my office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>John?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Customer</speaker><content>Oh John! Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Here he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m gonna need to have that back.  But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.  Ew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! I would trade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>Customer</speaker><content>It is beautiful, but I’m gonna use this one. Now, if you’ll excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Customer</speaker><content>You’re dying?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay, that’s enough honey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>Customer</speaker><content>I don’t know.  Let me see the ring.</content></utterance>
