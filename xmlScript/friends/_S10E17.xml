<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh. This was amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It really was. You've learned some new moves!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Next time, can I say breathe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>No, I'm okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Alright, I'll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>To use the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You can't leave me alone with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, ah... Any plans for the summer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>I don't know. Maybe church-camp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It's a baby chick and duck!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I did not see that coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That is the rule, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Guess what? You're almost an uncle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Have you seen him throw a ball?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Is Rachel here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my God. You and Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know, it's pretty great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But do you wanna get back together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> YAY!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Shhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, so is she still going to Paris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!  "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Morning!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I bet you did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-46"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-47"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-48"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-49"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-53"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-54"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-55"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Is it really that bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>The baby's head is crowning.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, that's spongy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  Oh, we are so lucky!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know. He has your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>The next baby should be along in a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We only ordered one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>You know it's twins, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"
><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Wait, did you know it was twins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Anybody tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Twins actually run in my family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What do you mean "what do we do"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Twins! Twins!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, you're panicking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We can't split them up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Okay. Shhh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>It looks like we're about ready over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Erica</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Here she comes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> She? It's a girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Well, now we have one of each!  And that's enough!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nothing! What do you say to that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You really think so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Can't a girl finish a song around here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross, wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Could you get me a muffin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh... Bye guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Unbelievable!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, you know what might help?</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"
><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Do you think they recognize each other from in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Nurse</speaker><content>We're going to take Erica to recovery now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.</content></utterance>
