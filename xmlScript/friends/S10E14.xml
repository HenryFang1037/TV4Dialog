<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Where did you go to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>YOU NEVER DID IT!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, let's see, call me Mrs. Hannigan.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?  Ooh, I like it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good for you. That was really mature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>You're a strange kind of grown-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content>Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Mr Zellner</speaker><content> That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Mr Zellner</speaker><content>Well, you got uhm... good energy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Oh, yeah...  Oh he's cute!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Mr Campbell</speaker><content>So... your resumé is quite impressive. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Mr Campbell</speaker><content>Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Mr Campbell</speaker><content>Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? I-I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Mr Campbell</speaker><content>You don't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I-I-I love it there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Mr Campbell</speaker><content>Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Mr Campbell</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Mr Campbell</speaker><content>That's Hugo Boss?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself.  But you obviously haven't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>How can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law.  You're fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>You need to fill out this form. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>It can be anything you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, not anything, I mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>Yeah... anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, this could take a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Clerk</speaker><content>Get out of my line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's what we were gonna name the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh! Princess Consuela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You seriously changed your name to that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, how'd the interview go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! It's not good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That is a bad interview.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh God. I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ross...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Six? You want me to join you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But also knowing it means a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...that center around work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>To Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, I'm so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Great. I feel like an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-46"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, it's okay, you didn't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-47"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you for letting us see the house again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Realtor</speaker><content>Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ah, so glad you decided to come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No it's not!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, we know that's you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Mike</speaker><content> Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Girl</speaker><content>I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Mackenzie</speaker><content> I hate my parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I hate my friends.  Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Mackenzie</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Mackenzie</speaker><content>What are you? Eight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Mackenzie</speaker><content>I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Mackenzie</speaker><content>I really don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Mackenzie</speaker><content>This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners.  Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, I guess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Mackenzie</speaker><content>Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Yeah, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Mackenzie</speaker><content>Then you gotta let them go.</content></utterance>
