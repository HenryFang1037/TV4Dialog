<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Monica...  Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>What're you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Just waiting for you sweetie.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>You're pretty much running that risk either way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Oh, well that's not so crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>I'm just easing you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Oh, alright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>But don't you need experience for a job like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content> Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>No kidding.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Where do you work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Ha-ha.  Are all you processors dorks?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What's goin' on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Chicken or small?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why aren't you at home in bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I never had 'em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Ohh, ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Can I please see your face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me...  Oh, I am scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well there you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Weird world. Your kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>I figure my character has kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know what makes the itching even worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>That you don't stop talking about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Let's just play, ok. Good, ok.  Here we go, double sixes, here we go...  Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What're you doing? Are you scratching?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>No. This is what I do for luck, ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You're scratching. Give me the dice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Give me the dice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>No. Here.  There. Ooh, double sixes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Give it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh God help me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>PHOEBE</speaker><content>Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Oh, stop that, stop that right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>JEANNIE</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>JEANNIE</speaker><content>Bye bye Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>What a phony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>MR. DOUGLAS</speaker><content>Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>MR. DOUGLAS</speaker><content>I have a family, I'm gonna be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Yeah Bing, what's that about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>MR. DOUGLAS</speaker><content>Rough numbers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>MR. DOUGLAS</speaker><content>Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Uh, if you say so sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Joseph's good, isn't he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Well, I'm going to kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>You're strict.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>It's for their own good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Very good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>You're gonna do what to my clocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>I'm gonna set them to my time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>No come on. Come on tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No. See you don't understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>No that's not true. That is not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>Alright, well tell me one of yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>What if they get mixed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>MONICA</speaker><content>You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>RICHARD</speaker><content>See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CHANDLER</speaker><content>Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.</content></utterance>

Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.</content></utterance>
