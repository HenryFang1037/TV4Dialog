<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I can't believe this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>LIPSON</speaker><content>I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Well, ya know, someone should have called me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>LIPSON</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.</content></utterance>
