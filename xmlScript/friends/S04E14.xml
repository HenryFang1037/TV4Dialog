<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Guggly worm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> And this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Glow-pop giggly jammer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> You make it so funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey umm, what’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Ohh, Geller’s got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh!  It’s the classic struggle between man and— Someone knocked over a lamp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> That’s all right. Hey you guys, you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you.  Well, except you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What’s Phase Two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How does going to a strip club help him better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because there are naked ladies there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There are naked ladies there too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ugh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the "Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, can you?  Hello!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Hello! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’ll be right there!  Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Thank goodness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Really?! Well, that’s just lovely, isn’t it? I must’ve missed your call, even though I didn’t leave the flat all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh well, no I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh, no-no-no, that’s not rude! It’s perfectly in keeping with a trip that I’ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who’s got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I-I-I think you look great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>It kicked! I think the baby kicked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey—whoa, slow down.  No, keep moving.  Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So? How did it go with Joshua last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So you hit her in the face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Aww, Pheebs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, that’s you’re name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! You’re wearing pants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s 9:30 in the morning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>They got a breakfast buffet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hello.  Oh, hey Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ooh, let me talk to him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh-oh, my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, can I just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Shh!!  Wait, what?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content> Ross! Come quickly! There’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why do you care so much anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>A couple of days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, come on, we can be guys!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>The A.D</speaker><content>There’s no way he smells, he’s the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?</content></utterance>
