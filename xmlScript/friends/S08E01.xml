</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What size shoes do you wear?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>…in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> What?!  Why bother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How do you feel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make.  Somebody just take this away from me!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How many ways are there to do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like,  "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories.  And-and there was some sad memories.  I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa!  Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity.  Oh! To the happy couple!</content></utterance>
