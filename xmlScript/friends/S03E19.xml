<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, forget about it. She rocks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Where do I know you from?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, that was real.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What, so what are you gonna tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now.  Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't have any issues with my Father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks.

<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow, what-what do you think she wants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me ah sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Then be supportive like a guy.</content></utterance>

I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on!

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>The Director</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>The Director</speaker><content>Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>It doesn't say that in the script.</content></utterance>
