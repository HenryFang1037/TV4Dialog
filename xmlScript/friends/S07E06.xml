<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We can’t do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because it’s weird!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine! Do you want something to drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure, what do you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can you figure out what I’m doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You’re Lewis Posin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa….  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, 10 is the highest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why is 10 the highest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Because it’s the highest.  Okay, Rachel you’re up first.  Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I don’t want to marry Chandler!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’ve got cold feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>…it’s gonna be okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thanks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, very nice Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you judges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh, what a kiss ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, Phoebe…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes! Your honor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> When Monica was a little girl, I remember that——Ooh!! Ow! Very good!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as…  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Ross and Joey</speaker><content>Oh! That’s nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow.  Good speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, it really was!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Aw, thanks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next  although I really don’t see the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And she’s back in the game.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Julie</speaker><content>Hello Skidmark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s pretty clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Julie</speaker><content>That’s why you broke up with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really?! I won!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well then I demand a recount! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Actually, it wasn’t that close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin!  All right?!  Heads! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>The coins have finally forgiven me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Rach, it’s gonna be okay!  You guys are the best!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why-why would I care about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I would really love it if could do both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I…I have to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?</content></utterance>
