And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.  Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours.  It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Kara</speaker><content>So how do you kids like your coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, none for me. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Just a little bit of sugar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> How does that laugh not give you a headache?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, you get used to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content> Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself.  Did you hear what I said Bing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think I do!  Thank you, Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I thought you could use the help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Coffee in a fight! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why would I be mad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do!
