<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>All</speaker><content>No way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, Rachel.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We have a winner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> And you didn't marry him because...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh Ross, you're so great. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-39"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It's never gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-40"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-41"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You and Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-42"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What?  Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-43"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-44"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-45"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross, you're mayor of the zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-46"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-47"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-49"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-50"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Shhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-51"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What are you shushing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-52"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-53"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ahhhh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-54"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-55"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Um, is it sugarless?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content> Sorry, it's not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> OK, here goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Are you going to do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm going to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do you want any help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You come out there, you're a dead man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Good luck, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks.  OK.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You can't go out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Because of... the reason.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He's planning your birthday party.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>My surprise party!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What surprise party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh stop it. Joey already told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, he didn't tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, you are not. We tell you stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmmm... this is so nice.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.</content></utterance>
