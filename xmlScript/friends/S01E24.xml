<utterance uid="2-68"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Not following you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-69"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-70"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>OK, I'm guessing this is from...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-71"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, thank you, Melanie.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-79"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Who's this from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-80"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, that's Ross's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-81"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh... ...  Oh my God. He remembered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-82"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Remembered what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-83"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-84"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-85"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-86"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can't believe he did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-87"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-88"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What did you just say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-89"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> ahem... um... Crystal duck.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-92"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh.... my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-93"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh, no-no-no-no-no....</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>OK, is there a mute button on this woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> H-He's in China!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>The country.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>From here to the airport?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes!  You're never gonna make it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I-I-I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well then maybe you shouldn't go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Here, look, alright, does this help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Flight Attendant</speaker><content>Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Melanie</speaker><content>I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I didn't know you had another level.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Intercom</speaker><content>It's me, Carl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>C'mon up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? </content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Carl</speaker><content>I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine, just stop thinking about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Can't do it, can you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So I'm thinking about you. So what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Carl</speaker><content>I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, it's too hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, you're like my best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>If we broke up, and I lost you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, start looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Carl</speaker><content>Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right! You're right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Carl</speaker><content>Heh... y'know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You know what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>Carl</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>Carl</speaker><content>But...</content></utterance>
