<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She had a point. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can’t wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There’s a trick."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi boots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! They’re beautiful!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ahh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> They hurt so much!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well then get your money back and return them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I don’t think you did a very thorough job!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I dropped him off at Carol’s.  Anyway, it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no! Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How come?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Playpen?! Ben’s seven!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Your kid is seven?!   He’s really small.  Please! Please get the tickets!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes you can! Sting says so himself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Rosssss can!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>I…I don’t care about fashion! I’m pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> And there’s marketing…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay?  Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! It’s my fashion girls!  What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! Dina…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>Jack? I hate him! He’s a jerk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ben</speaker><content>I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Him you’re friends with. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Are you with one of the students?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Are you one of Ben’s mothers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Well hi, I’m Jenny Boone. I’m the new teacher here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>I’ve only met your partner Carol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Right. Are you looking for Jack’s parents to discuss the problems he’s having with Ben?  Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh no, we can’t walk!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  It’s oddly unsettling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hop on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right Joey! That is enough!  Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well what am I supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective!  Right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content>Do sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content>I gather Jack and Ben haven’t been getting along lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content>I’m told there are two sides to this story, but all I’ve heard is that Ben’s a bit of a poo-poo head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content>Oh I’m sorry, Jack’s father is not available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content>Oh no, I know that wouldn’t work. My husband’s in concert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content>So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content>Are you here for tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, thank you. Four would be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content>I’m not giving concert tickets to someone who’d use their son like this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Trudie Styler</speaker><content> Look, I’ve just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>The Police? Here? A reunion?! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I don’t have your boots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.  God well, we gotta go back and get them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.  All right.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>Well it’s just me and my pal Rooster, the band’s name is Numb Nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Really? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, that’s not a compliment!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>No Joey! I knew you wouldn’t be supportive!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I’m just gonna need some help. And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, we’re straight-up gangster rap. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>And you’re my big brother! I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world. I’m not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>Dina</speaker><content>We’re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s right! By his uncle too!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>And by you.</content></utterance>
