<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> That's great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Humiliating and noble!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway...and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Is it a good play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Intern</speaker><content>Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys...except for the tie, the briefcase...and the fact that I can rent a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Intern</speaker><content>Seriously, you're an intern?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Intern</speaker><content> Dude!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>The comedian? USO?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Intern</speaker><content> Uhm, it's USA, sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Receptionist</speaker><content>This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>Well, I've...I've been blessed with a...a lot of great roles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out.  I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>Peeeeeooooooooch  "Hang up that phone!" One take!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>So, shall we read?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>"What the hell are you still doing here"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Err, "I think you know".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>"Bastard"!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>"Go, go!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern  "I could go right now, maaan!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content> My god in heaven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.  This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also:  'How you doing?'  You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content>Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I really doubt that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Lennart</speaker><content> No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I hear divorce bells.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Mugger</speaker><content>Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Mugger</speaker><content>I have a gun </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Mugger</speaker><content>Alright, lady, now give me your purse!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Lowell, is that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Lowell</speaker><content>Phoebe?  Oh my god!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh my god!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Lowell</speaker><content>Ross, nice to meet you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, a real pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ah, it's been so long, so long.  I can't believe you're still doing this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Lowell</speaker><content>Oh, I know, but I quit smoking!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good for you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Lowell</speaker><content>So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, how did the audition go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So far so good! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Honey, I'm old!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What are they? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I'll give you $500 for them!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What am I supposed to do with these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps".  And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!  Would you help me try to sell these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey, hey!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You okay?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> How do you know a mugger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know...sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Phoebe, that is awful!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony...I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're mother killed herself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She was a drug dealer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Okay...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> You were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics...you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble Spiderman got into that week-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Wonderwoman!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone... ...when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Oh my god...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>A superhuman thirst for knowledge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No...actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street...that's where Stabby Joe works.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I think we have a problem here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.</content></utterance>

Plus...what you've got that...I don't know what you've got going...this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but – you know what? – more, more. Can you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No, that seems about right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, that was formula.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We gotta get more of that. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You know what...these aren't half-bad!  You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, how was class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nothing, I really wanna know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make...uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, it wasn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yes, it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> "Gimme your money, punk!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you...you mugged me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat.  I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have...have a great one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's not the best!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really? Even more humiliating than...</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Intern</speaker><content>...and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Boss</speaker><content> That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next?  Chander...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Intern</speaker><content> Your age?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know...maybe he falls...maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Boss</speaker><content>Chandler, that's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, thank you, sir...or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Boss</speaker><content>You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's….  You did you come up with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Boss</speaker><content>That is great. Good work!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Boss</speaker><content>See all of you tomorrow. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell...or smoke.  Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy" </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can't say, I just thought it was really good...and...maybe would be worth something some day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah...but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.</content></utterance>
