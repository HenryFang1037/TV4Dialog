It didn’t mean anything. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…</content></utterance>

Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all!  That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Mr. Waltham</speaker><content>All right, I’ll tell her.  Come on bugger face!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y’know, technically we still are over international waters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>‘Kay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Can I ask you something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uhh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Thanks man.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But what about how much taller he is than me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.</content></utterance>
