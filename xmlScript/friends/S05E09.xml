<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Whoa! Ohh!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So Pheebs, what is the book about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I thought you said you read it in high school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> You completely stole my answer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, honey that was pretty obvious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>What do you think? You in the blue shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Would ya care to venture one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Would you care to venture one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Are you just repeating what I'm saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you just repeating what I'm saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>All right, let's move on.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Phoebe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh—I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content>We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content>Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content>We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content> A sandwich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content> Oh, you know what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content>I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You ate my sandwich?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content>It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content>There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> That said it was my sandwich?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Dr. Leedbetter</speaker><content>Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You didn't read this one either?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No! You should've read it yourself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content> Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>Well, go ahead Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>The Teacher</speaker><content>If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> You're naked in this picture!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ross, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>On account of my rage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Which I may say, right now, is out of control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He gave me a pill for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>A pill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And you're okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That was not funny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes it's true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-42"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhh, Monica?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-43"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-44"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But sadly I could not be enticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-45"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-46"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-47"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. </content></utterance>
