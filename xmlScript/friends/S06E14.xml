<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s not random, it’s Bob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hm-mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Y’know Bob in Human Resources…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was!  You had me doubting my fashion sense!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Why are you so jealous of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Jill</speaker><content>Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes, but you are dead inside.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Absolutely not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Y’know maybe a little bit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Probably just the first half.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.</content></utterance>
