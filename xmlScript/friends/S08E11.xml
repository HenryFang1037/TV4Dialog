<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look at that guy by the window, wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.  Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted too, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait a second! This is about the forth month of your pregnancy right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This is completely normal, around the forth month your hormones start going crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?! So this has happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I’m missin’ picture time?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Y’know she has a face Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, here’s a good one of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Together? Like-like to people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Yeah, y’know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It’ll be cute, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know. Can you believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes, hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No leg chewing for us sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t think of anything we’re doing.  Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow!  Just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow.  I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh. Wow, this is great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>How many did you want? I’m getting a hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Really? Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Oh y’know, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re right. You’re right. So, can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Where are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Y’know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hmm…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>I mean I love spending time with you, y’know I just—I hope we’re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Let’s do the card!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The card! I think we’re there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really?! I mean, even with the card?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Dr. Schiff</speaker><content>I’m a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Dr. Schiff</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my forth month of pregnancy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You wish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah? Come and get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, even this is turning me on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh! Women!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh Ross? You asked me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Like asking her to move in with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Smaller than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Making her a mixed tape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, bigger than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Give her a key to your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, we hate that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That is a slap in the face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>So why can’t the three of us go out together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Aw, we-we are so… So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>You don’t think this is too fast.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You gave her a key to your apartment?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have sex with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Bing—What’s this?! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>No, it’s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We’re gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Doug</speaker><content>Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y’know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content> Hey Ross, what’s going on? You changing the lock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No. That guy is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>I don’t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Locksmith</speaker><content>Good luck buddy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Mona</speaker><content>Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you’re-you’re sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>From the tequila factory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so…hard…to find.  So how was your day?</content></utterance>
