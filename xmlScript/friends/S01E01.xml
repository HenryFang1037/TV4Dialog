<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait, does he eat chalk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sounds like a date to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Had that dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Instead of...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Never had that dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And they weren't looking at you before?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you okay, sweetie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Cookie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Carol moved her stuff out today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Let me get you some coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh! Oh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Fine!  Be murky!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And you never knew she was a lesbian...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know,  how should I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And I just want a million dollars! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>Waitress</speaker><content>Can I get you some coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi, sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-  Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-51"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Who wasn't invited to the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-52"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I'll have whatever Christine is having.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I say push her down the stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You can see where he'd have trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things... Phoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm all better now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> I helped!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What, like there's a rule or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content> It's, uh, it's Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Who's Paul?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He finally asked you out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rach, wait, I can cancel...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Please, no, go, that'd be fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> That'd be good...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>A wandering?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey, Paul!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Shut up, Joey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yes, and we're very excited about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la-  Thank you.  La-la-la-la...ohhh!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's a beautiful thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> What's this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Which goes where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Done with the bookcase!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All finished!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, God.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>-leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content> That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Ooh, steer clear of you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You must stop! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That only took me an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.</content></utterance>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Isn't there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform.  ...Sexually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>It's okay...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Two years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Rachel!  That was a library card!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..</content></utterance>
