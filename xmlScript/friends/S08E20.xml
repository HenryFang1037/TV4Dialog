<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care, as long as my mom’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my God, your mother!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>My God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh give it a rest!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, y’know what? Don’t worry, okay? We’ll take care of it. We’ll call her. Just go home and get ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean it’s my mom!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know. I know, what’s her number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Go! I have it in my book. Go!   Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Oh, hello Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we’ve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>I know, my daughter’s told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God, my ass is sweating!  Please! Please! Can you come? It’s today at four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Well all right. I’ll see you at four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Isn’t it at three?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll  Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I’ll be  Joey Trrrribbiani!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well do you want some help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Awesome!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Bamboozled?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well uh, I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben!  And uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Bogota.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What does a Wicked Wango card do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Higher or lower than what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>This is embarrassing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Can you believe how lame this is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m so glad you could make it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Try. There’s my little girl. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She’s still mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. I can do that.  I gotta go powder my ass.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn’t know better I’d say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let’s get some tea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don’t want you to use your housekeeper ‘cause it would just split her focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>It’s like you’re a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don’t know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Such a sweet woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Oh Rachel!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>I just had the greatest idea! I’m gonna come live with you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wh-wh-what? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so happy I’m gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes. Yes I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s okay, I’m ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let me see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>This one right here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Triscadecaphobia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> The fear of Triscuts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No! No, fear of the number 13.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Fear of Triscuts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right Chandler, you’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This game makes no sense!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You-you must choose Mr. Bing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Either, it makes no difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Choose, you jackass!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’ll take a card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>This game is kinda fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why did you invite my mother?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>For how long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>She can’t hear you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you’re the most important person in this room. And in the world!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Well uh, I don’t have a gift because I wasn’t invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone’s attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Sweetheart I know you’re gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Really? Remember Twinkles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Oh look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, this is from your friend at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is!  Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Darling, that’s a breast pump!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>It’s a diaper genie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>No! It’s where you put the dirty ones!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Oh you’re gonna do that ten times a day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>No dear, that’s what babies do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you’re trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table?  What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>You can’t leave a baby alone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh come——Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>It’s actually a bassinet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay mommy, don’t ever leave me. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>I’m going to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Now don’t worry! Everything’s gonna be okay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It is going to be okay!  It was worth a shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Not if you were here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> A Play-Dough Barber Shop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content> Hi Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi roomie! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Man</speaker><content>Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Ray</speaker><content>And this is Duncan  and Erin, they’re gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let’s get the camera rolling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Rightie-O Ray!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Ray</speaker><content>Whenever you’re ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hello, I’m Joey Tribbiani! Let’s play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Erin</speaker><content>Wayne Gretzky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Ray</speaker><content>Uh Joey, didn’t your agents give you the revised rules? We’ve eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What—Why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Ray</speaker><content>Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn’t follow it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Ray</speaker><content>Yeah all that’s gone. It’s basically just a simple question and answer game now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Ray</speaker><content>Well, there’ll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Let’s play Bamboozled!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>…and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well we…we don’t have a garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Did I say garage? I meant garbage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Well Rachel needs help with the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, not a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s frightening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>That’s true. You do have another child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>With another woman. Have you no control Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Well then you really don’t need me to live with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>You’re gonna be a great father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up.  Hey! You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I hope you’re going somewhere with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I’m telling you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>All right you two, I’m gonna get going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> You’re still so funny. You’re so funny.  What do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Uh-huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green!  It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>Mrs. Green</speaker><content>Spiteful?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day!  I can’t feel my legs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-42"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah? I’m proud of me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-43"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You should be!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-44"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-45"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You got it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-46"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay.  Mrs. Green! Okay I’m really sorry!! I’m apologizing for the—  Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m still really sorry!</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay! I’m ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right then.  Rachel Green! Let’s play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh, put your elbow in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>A card! A card! I pick a card!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother!  I’ve lost sight of why we’re doing this! </content></utterance>
