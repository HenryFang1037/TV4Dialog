<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s partly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many,  many stories that Rachel has told me that, well  you’re not  all bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not all bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>And anyhow, I’m sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I  still look at Lizzie like she’s a twelve-year-old girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Paul</speaker><content>You have a son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife!  Oh, I’m sorry!  It’s unbelievable!</content></utterance>
