<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content> Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Eh, do you believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Yeah?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I was shrieking... like a Marine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You broke a little girl's leg?!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I know. I feel horrible. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm gonna get back to retraining. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, see you guys. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look out kids, he's coming! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? Me having a job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  Hey, how do you sleep at night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>What if you put them here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>It's all right. Sweetheart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>So far, I've sold seventy-five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Five dollars a box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> And what is second prize?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, that makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, Sarah, anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Sarah</speaker><content>Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content> Yesss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>I can still see you!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, what happens to the old guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, they go into the chipper.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh God! I gotta go! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em! </content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>The fear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because, I'm too afraid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Can't I just look at the handles on them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>You would think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Gunther</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Gunther, I quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ah, we're out. I sold them all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica, I'm cutting you off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh my God, how did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well you sure used a large font.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Something else I might have said?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
