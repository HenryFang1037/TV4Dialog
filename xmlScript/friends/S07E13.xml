<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Why would you want to do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Rach, there is a decent place to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. No. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. Rosita does not move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Rosita? As in…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>As in Rosita does not move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Stevie the TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Is there a problem?</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That’s weird isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Couldn’t I just say, "This is Ross?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Sure, do whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look at this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What? What happened to the window in the attic?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes we’re surprised!  Who did you leave a message with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Sorry! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, Joey I am so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> She’s not even cold yet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Okay? You ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, I…  I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>They kept your room for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Come on, you know they love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>As much as they love you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh, I hate this year!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What’s wrong with this year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That was me and Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh that’s right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh yeah, like you never called!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Supervisor</speaker><content>So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Supervisor</speaker><content> Why don’t we do a trial run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Supervisor</speaker><content>I’m the supply manager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Supervisor</speaker><content>We don’t need any toner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.  Yeah you’re right, this is easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Supervisor</speaker><content>Okay, what was wrong with that call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Supervisor</speaker><content>They’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner, but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Supervisor</speaker><content>So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey! Joe!  Full bag.  Beer’s still cold. Something terrible must’ve happened here!  Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!  Stevie, I was never here! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I’m here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know what’s in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I used to love to play restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>So, I think you’re boxes are over here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I don’t know. They-they must be your mother’s, but please, please don’t ask her. I’ll throw these away. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym… Oooh, my rock polisher!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Oh look, look there’s your old makeup kit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Well, the white seems to be untouched.  Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Y’know how the garage floods every Spring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>How are you ever going to sell this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>I think I accidentally used Monica’s boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh no. Dad! Dad! What… Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>You don’t secretly smoke do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>So it’s just your mother then.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?  Earl, thanks.  Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>I don’t need any toner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>Not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>May I ask why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>You wanna know why. You wanna know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I surely do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t need any toner because I’m going to kill myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>Okay, so…no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>Well…I only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Chandler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>I-I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I’ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on.  Hey everybody! Uh, I’m gonna kill myself!  I’ll get back to ya.  I got nothing. Wait.  Uh, hey Marge!   Ehh, nothing. Nothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You will like it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You don’t even know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well look, if you don’t like this…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don’t know why you say that so soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Francette? What is she? A couch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool.  She’s heeled!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, I really don’t…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Can you tell me how this happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Miracle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Someone like an…angel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Oh my God, does she really thinks that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, can you blame her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Well I don’t know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Like uh y’know like this! This!  She-she could’ve made this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Right? And this!  She-she could’ve won this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content> This could’ve been hers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>Mr. Geller</speaker><content>Your make-up kit? I’d feel better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> My chair heels itself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content> Hey guy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>No! That’s just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He’s the worst! I’d like to take him with me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content> Yeah! Right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh sorry, boyfriend!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Noo!  Angels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I’m gettin’ my chair back! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? Wh-hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey you broke my chair!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Your chair?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, there was no miracle?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No Joe, no miracle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think I should get the chair!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How do you figure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, where’s the logic in that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!</content></utterance>

And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content>Yeah-yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>Earl</speaker><content> Did you hear that?! I don’t need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe!   I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place.  Hey! Guys!   Oh no, it’s you.</content></utterance>
