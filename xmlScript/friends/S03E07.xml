Now um, on my first day as  Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives,  I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this.  Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it'  Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.  And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Student</speaker><content>Hey, Mr. Trib.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You bet! What's the part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Student</speaker><content>Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Thank you.</content></utterance>
