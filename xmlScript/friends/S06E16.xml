<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Ooh, actually I’ve been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone’s been doing their homework. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Carol</speaker><content>Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, I know.  Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, Pheebs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, how’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Here you go sweetie.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you two girls whispering about over there?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> But I think we should tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, you used to like playing the guitar.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will!  Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>People! People say it! Come here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Dr. Roger</speaker><content>So oysters, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Dr. Roger</speaker><content>Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases…</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Joey, you’re such an amazing actor!  How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! Tell me something Joey——Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No!  Oyster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah!  If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I do like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Absolutely! It would just be one friend  helping out another friend. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Noo!! Okay!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>God I’m just a horrible person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wh-why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous! I’m not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>The ring from the cave, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wow! Uh okay, well uh… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No! No-no-no…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, do you want the ring or not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh-oh, absolutely!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>But you got to be with both of them, right?</content></utterance>
