<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it's like to be you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>We were all pretty shaken up about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!   And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You get the dollhouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I get the dollhouse!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, just a barrel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Really?! Really?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What's this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's a dog, every house should have a dog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Not one that can pee on the roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> And is this in case the house sneezes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I don't want a ghost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay,  fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What's this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This is the coolest house ever!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Chandler is fantastic!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>The Director</speaker><content> Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec.  I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Do you want me to want you to care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>The Director</speaker><content> Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>I've got no reason to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>The Director</speaker><content>Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>I can't believe we go on in, in a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, it's gonna be all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Lauren</speaker><content> Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Lauren</speaker><content>You know! At the place I told you about last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Lauren</speaker><content>Oh, okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>How do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe he could slip her the tongue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Something like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Kate</speaker><content>Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You're kidding?! That's great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, it was so amazing. After the  love making...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's what you say at the end of a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, they always called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hmm, bite me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content> Did he call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Sophie</speaker><content>Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>Joanna</speaker><content>Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Call her! Call her now!</content></utterance>

And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.</content></utterance>
