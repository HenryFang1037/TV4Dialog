<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Great! Problem solved!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, back to square one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind.  Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Peanut butter!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>A swimmer!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, no thank you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What's with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What do you like better action or comedy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>Dr. Miller</speaker><content>And I'll fit you for a glass eye.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You got it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right!</content></utterance>
