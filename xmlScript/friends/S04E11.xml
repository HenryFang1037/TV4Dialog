<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>‘Cause it just sorta happened, y’know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too.  Okay. Okay. Stop it, don’t. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>Uhh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>We’ve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we’d get a jump on things, y’know no one’s getting any younger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>See the thing is umm, we’re not able to y’know, uh, conceive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Alice</speaker><content>And we’ve tried everything, we’ve seen a bunch of doctors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Frank</speaker><content>Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> That’s a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, how can you be a tour guide, don’t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, not really. They give you all the information, it’s uh, it’s like memorizing a script.  "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh actually Joey, it’s the Cretasous period.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh my God!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>And! And, they’re gonna have a baby!  And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You’re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ewww! And "Oh no!" It’s—they just want me to be the surrogate. It’s her-it’s her egg and her sperm, and I’m-I’m just the oven, it’s totally their bun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What did you tell them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I’m gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, like you’re gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Pheebs, you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it’s all for somebody else!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, what’s your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, the stuff I just mentioned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Wow! I don’t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive like crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>We just want you to think it through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Umm,  I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, sure, it’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Kathy</speaker><content>Oh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I am so jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>You guys are really right…there aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes. Right where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>In the beginning where y’know it’s all sex and talking and sex and talking and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>And the sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, we haven’t had sex yet. Okay, what’s the big deal? Y’know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Chandler that is so nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That is really nice…lying! No way is that the reason!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why? Just because you’re not mature enough to understand something like that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, he’s right, I’m totally lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Then what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, and I was saying the actual words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Sweetie, with you it’s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, ‘cause you-you guys are in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Just go for it Chandler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah, you should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, you should, really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Smart Kid</speaker><content>Isn’t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here,  we have a large foot.  Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller.  Everyone wave ‘Hi’ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.  Okay, moving right along. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>It’s open! Come in!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’m late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>Oh, that’s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! You really go all out when you’re expecting company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>No, I was working on my pottery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn’t know that you did…pot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, erotiery!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y’know…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>I really don’t think it’s a very good idea, Phoebe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>Well, because you’d be giving up a baby, and I-I really don’t—I don’t know if there’s anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don’t-don’t hurt the puppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>No-no-no, the-the puppy’s yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, I get a puppy!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>I realise I don’t have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm,  uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it’s very important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Phoebe Sr</speaker><content>I mean, I know what I’m talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child.  I really shouldn’t have given you the puppy first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for my friend Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Tour Guide</speaker><content>You mean Dr. Geller?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Doctor? Wow! I didn’t know he had a nickname.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Tour Guide</speaker><content>Oh, he won’t sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, how-how come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Tour Guide</speaker><content>That’s just the way it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That’s crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Tour Guide</speaker><content>Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter! Hey, Peter! It’s me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin’ which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack!  See, he pretend he don’t even here me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you. Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he will sit in it!  Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal. Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it. Y’know, hey I understand. Y’know? Hey, when I’m in a play and you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right? So it’s y’know, it’s uh, it’s cool. I’ll see you tomorrow. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, y’know what, I think it’s time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let’s go to the balcony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, the street. Come on, let’s go to the street. Ooh, listen, don’t go onto the balcony until after I get back. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> So, did you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, yes, we had the sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Uh-oh, it was bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It was fine, y’know? But she didn’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I’m all right with it."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, it was the first time. Y’know, there’s not always a lot of agreement the first time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody’s killing her in there!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, I’m gonna show you something a lot of guys don’t know. Rach, give me that pad, please?  All right. Now…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> There are seven?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Let me see that.  Oh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> That’s one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It’s kind of an important one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That-that’s bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well if you go to Disneyland, you don’t spend the whole day on the Materhorn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well you might if it were anything like 7!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit ‘em all, and you mix ‘em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.  I’m Ross! I’m divorced, and I have a kid!</content></utterance>
