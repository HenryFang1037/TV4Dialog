<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content> Games and stuff.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content> Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>There's an ad for a naked chef?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>You got all that from saline solution?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content> Hey, you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>Hi, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hi, Julie.  Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content> Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Oh, well, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content> Play it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Ok, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content> Ssshh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content> There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Mockolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>I'm sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Ohh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>All right. Mmm-mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content> I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content> Mmm-mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Aren't you going to swallow that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Yeah, isn't that great?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content> Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Abso......lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>How about Mockolate mousse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>What makes it pilgrim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>We'll put buckles on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Did uh, Ross call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>No, I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey, here's a thought, Ross. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Can't we just use a pen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>No, Amish boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>You could say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content> She's not Rachel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Oh my god good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content> Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content> So, Spock actually hugs his father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Hey, do you guys have......hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content> Where you goin'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Well, uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Really. It's always been you, Rach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Oh, god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Let me get my coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.  What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content> What? Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>No, no, see? See?  Hey, it's printing.  Hey, it's printing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Well what is it? Let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hey, someone order a coat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>He won't?  He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>And I'm in it? Then let me read it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content> Alright.  "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No, you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>What is this? Ross, what is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Just a waitress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-44"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-45"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-46"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-47"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>This was your idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>What were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content> All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Yeah. You!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>PHOE</speaker><content>Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content> When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Not interested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content> Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Number six: the way you smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content> Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>What are you doing out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>I am, uh, I am...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>That's what I said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CHAN</speaker><content>Look, maybe we should go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content> No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross.  I said don't go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content>Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>JOEY</speaker><content> I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know?  Maybe a little longer.</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Doesn't matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.  Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Well, uh, I ate some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RACH</speaker><content> Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content> Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>ROSS</speaker><content>Look, can, can you do something for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Sure, what? Ok, ok.   Music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RADIO</speaker><content>The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. </content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>RADIO</speaker><content>Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>MNCA</speaker><content>Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>RTST</speaker><content>It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?</content></utterance>
