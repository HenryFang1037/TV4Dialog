<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So what are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me!  Joey, you say things now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s the Knicks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Screw the Knicks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Done!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Let me finish.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh, we could end up with nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Or you could end up with everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh, I like that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Yeah, but it-it-it’s my whole life—you come to England.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Ohh, I don’t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Emily</speaker><content>Oh no, no, right I shouldn’t have said married. Uh, please don’t go freaky on me. I didn’t mean it. Well, I didn’t say it; I take it back!</content></utterance>
