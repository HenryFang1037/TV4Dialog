<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend -- which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Yeah! Oh my God!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Casey</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Great! All right, so I'll call you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Casey</speaker><content>Great! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Wait! You're going out with Kathy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I'm upset -- for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You got all that from the back of her head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease...  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well umm, y'know, I used to play.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Here we go.  Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions.  Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh my God! Play!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You mean like, music?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I like it in the stern.  ...of the boat.   Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Why can't you tell her?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Or Casey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No-no, Kathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Could be Casey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. No, Kathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Consider Casey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I think maybe, yeah.</content></utterance>
