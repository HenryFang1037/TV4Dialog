<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, do you get colours or just French tips?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Who's Amanda?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Are you trying to do a British accent?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ugh, Let's just cut her out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, had it done to me though. Feels good !</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-92"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You didn't like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-93"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-57"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> I am scrappy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-58"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-59"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It's because I'm scrappy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-60"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-61"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I won't know what I would do without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-62"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-63"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-64"><speaker>Amanda</speaker><content>Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-65"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content>Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-66"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-67"><speaker>Glenda</speaker><content> Okay...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-68"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-69"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Which... which... which... Which one is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-70"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>OH! SON OF A BITCH!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-71"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What is the matter with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-72"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I know what's the matter with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-73"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-74"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-75"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-76"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-77"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-78"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-79"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-80"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-81"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-82"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-83"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-84"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right, totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-85"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-86"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-87"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That's a... pla-an.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-88"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Wow... I did not see this coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-89"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-90"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-91"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hmmm... Me too...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-92"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-93"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-94"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Aah... I bet you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-95"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-96"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-97"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I love ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-98"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-99"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-100"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.</content></utterance>
