<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on! You guys can pee standing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Multiple orgasms!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No plans, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Not a one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, right, right, shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Tony?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Does anybody want anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That guy, he burns me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Uh-huh, uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>Hi, Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>My god, Angela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you gonna go over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content> Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You don't say.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Don't you have a laundry room in your building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Bob? Who the hell's Bob?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>We're just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>What four of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh, god help us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nuh-uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yuh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Which?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Which what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You've never met Bob, have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, but he's...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>Hey, Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Where are they? Where are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Eww, I don't wanna do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, have a good break-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, Janice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>I got you...these. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content> No, no, I'm still working on mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>That's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, it was really hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, you weren't there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Comin' through. Move, move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But I saved it. I put my basket on top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>No suds, no save. Ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What's goin' on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Was your basket on top?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, but, there were no suds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, you know, no suds, no save.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Woman</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> All right, show's over. Nothing to see here.  Ok, let's do laundry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach, have you never done this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> He is so cute.  So, where did you guys grow up?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So, you and Angela, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>Yep. Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>Huh, I never really noticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>Monica, Monica is great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.</content></utterance>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>Yeah, isn't he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Angela</speaker><content>Huh. That's nice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Janice</speaker><content>All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What uh-oh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing.  Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ross, what's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Come on, show me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, everything's pink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Come on, they're close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Oh my god, what were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.</content></utterance>
