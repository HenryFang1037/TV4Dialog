<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh that's not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>London is stupid! Stupid!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I'll do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What's that? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But, it's not raining.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't catch a break!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ohh! You did not drop any socks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> What?!! You cannot tell him that!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I make the decisions, and I say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I'm gonna do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>But I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right, fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Joey, I'm in!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, all of us! All day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Makes me wanna puke! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay. I-I can't watch. </content></utterance>
