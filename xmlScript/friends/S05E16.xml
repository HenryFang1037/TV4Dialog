<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You could get arrested, right now!  All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Hey.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, it involved Monica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What was the dream about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It-it doesn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>That kinda sounds like your dream dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Um-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content> Not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well there you have it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Friends first? That's interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You become friends after?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content>Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>Guy</speaker><content> So am I!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Ohh, no.  Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content> Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>No, I don't know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content> Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content>Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>I-I sure will, take care. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Cop</speaker><content> Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good.  And where did you find my badge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off,  for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Thanks!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What's up Joe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>…is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> What are you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I'll treat you real nice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Won't-won't that take longer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah. I understand. I understand.  Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh great! What, you brought Joey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, I brought the next best thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.  Okay Rach,  that's you. That's the couch. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? </content></utterance>
