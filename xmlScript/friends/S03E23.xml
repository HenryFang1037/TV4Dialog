<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.  I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.</content></utterance>
