<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Mr. Franklin</speaker><content>You’re a joker Bing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What’s funny about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, why don’t you correct him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel?  Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Shh! It is a family name!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Kash</speaker><content>Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.  And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I…I have to fire him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But why?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I paid to have this done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Love it!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I thought I was a complete idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I said no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Mr. Franklin</speaker><content>Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Mr. Franklin</speaker><content>Oh then you know each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>We’re on a semi-first name basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Mr. Franklin</speaker><content>What do you think of adding him to our team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Mr. Franklin</speaker><content>Really? They love him down on six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>Mr. Franklin</speaker><content>Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I think it’s best sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>Mr. Franklin</speaker><content>But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>Mr. Franklin</speaker><content> That’s a good one. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>But…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Why not?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Because I’m dumping him today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What?! You said he was sweet!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time.  "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Just don’t pick up your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Then he comes over!  "I’m so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>All right, that makes sense.  Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>Hey Toby, you got a sec?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Sure, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Bob</speaker><content>I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Rach? You wanna come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh no, I can’t. I got a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>A date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>It’s no Ukrainian film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>I set her up with this actor on my show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You set her up?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey what-what were you thinking?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey! I’m an  actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>Kash</speaker><content>Hey Joey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I just…I have to find out how it went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know?
