1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,120
<1-1,Raj>昨天晚上我跟露西视频
<1-1,Raj>So, anyway, last night on video chat,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,500
<1-1,Raj>我盯着她的双眸足足有二十分钟
<1-1,Raj>I spent, like, 20 minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,730
<1-2,Leonard>听起来很浪漫啊
<1-2,Leonard>Oh, that sounds romantic.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,410
<1-3,Raj>后来发现是画面卡了  就毫无浪漫可言了
<1-3,Raj>It was until I realized the screen had frozen.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,840
<1-3,Raj>但这还是我这辈子最棒约会的前三名
<1-3,Raj>Still one of my top three dates of all time.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,690
<1-4,Leonard>她什么时候会来跟大伙聚聚啊
<1-4,Leonard>So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,560
<1-5,Raj>我也想啊
<1-5,Raj>I'd love that,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,920
<1-5,Raj>但她实在不太善于与人交流
<1-5,Raj>but she's not really comfortable around people.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,760
<1-6,Sheldon>我以前也跟她一样不善与人交流
<1-6,Sheldon>Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people,

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,400
<1-6,Sheldon>后来学到一个小诀窍
<1-6,Sheldon>but then I learned a trick.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
<1-6,Sheldon>我把认识的每个人
<1-6,Sheldon>I pretend everyone I meet

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,420
<1-6,Sheldon>都看作是《星际迷航》里受欢迎的角色
<1-6,Sheldon>is a beloved character from Star Trek.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,050
<1-7,Leonard>那这招管用吗
<1-7,Leonard>How's that been working for you?

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,550
<1-8,Sheldon>当然好用啊  你个无名红衣机组人员
<1-8,Sheldon>Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,810
<1-9,Howard>莱纳德  我可能帮你弄到了份工作
<1-9,Howard>Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,610
<1-10,Leonard>-我有工作了  -他真的有哦
<1-10,Leonard>- I have a job. - Yes, he does.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,750
<1-11,Sheldon>工作就是服务我的一切要求
<1-11,Sheldon>He caters to my every whim.

18
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,120
<1-12,Howard>不  再过几周  史蒂芬·霍金要
<1-12,Howard>No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's team

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,680
<1-12,Howard>送一对远征实验队伍去北海
<1-12,Howard>is sending an expedition to the North Sea

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,270
<1-12,Howard>做黑洞的流体动力学模拟
<1-12,Howard>to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes.

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,750
<1-12,Howard>队伍中有一名实验物理学家退出了
<1-12,Howard>One of their experimental physicists dropped out,

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,890
<1-12,Howard>所以我就推荐了你
<1-12,Howard>and I recommended you.

23
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,110
<1-13,Leonard>你觉得我真有机会雀屏中选吗
<1-13,Leonard>Well, do you really think I have a shot?

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,430
<1-14,Howard>我跟霍金共事过  说了你不少好话呢
<1-14,Howard>Yeah, I've worked with Hawking. I talked you up.

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,870
<1-14,Howard>他知道你的研究
<1-14,Howard>He knows your research.

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,280
<1-14,Howard>我觉得希望非常大
<1-14,Howard>I think this could happen.

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,400
<1-15,Leonard>他居然知道...  哇
<1-15,Leonard>He knows-- Wow!

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,820
<1-16,Sheldon>你觉得这真是个好主意吗
<1-16,Sheldon>Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea?

29
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,670
<1-16,Sheldon>我觉得行  你也知道《星际迷航》
<1-16,Sheldon>I do. Uh, you know Star Trek.

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,350
<1-16,Sheldon>一个没有角色名字
<1-16,Sheldon>Should a guy with no name

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,280
<1-16,Sheldon>穿着普通制服的人适合去参加实验吗
<1-16,Sheldon>and a red shirt really go on an expedition?

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,540
<1-17,Raj>别这样打击他
<1-17,Raj>Hey, don't discourage him.

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,230
<1-17,Raj>这是他千载难逢的好机会呢
<1-17,Raj>This is a fantastic opportunity.

34
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,250
<1-18,Sheldon>没人问你  女通讯官乌乎拉
<1-18,Sheldon>No one asked you, Uhura.

35
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,320
<2-1,Sheldon>想听听谢尔顿招牌亦假亦真小讲堂吗
<2-1,Sheldon>Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,670
<2-2,Leonard>-你说呢  -很好
<2-2,Leonard>- What do you think? - Great.

37
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,330
<2-3,Sheldon>我最近读了不少交通工具安全
<2-3,Sheldon>I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety.

38
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,980
<2-3,Sheldon>你知道溺水的最高几率的
<2-3,Sheldon>Did you know that the highest number

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,800
<2-3,Sheldon>发生地点是在船上或是船附近吗
<2-3,Sheldon>of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,820
<2-4,Leonard>在我很有可能去船上工作前
<2-4,Leonard>Interesting that you would bring that up

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,670
<2-4,Leonard>你提起这事  时机很巧妙啊
<2-4,Leonard>when I might go work on a boat.

42
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,290
<2-5,Sheldon>亦假亦真就是这样的
<2-5,Sheldon>Well, that's the thing about factoids--

43
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,100
<2-5,Sheldon>听起来就很巧妙
<2-5,Sheldon>they're interesting.

44
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,130
<2-6,Leonard>我知道你的小算盘
<2-6,Leonard>I know what you're doing.

45
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,700
<2-6,Leonard>你不想我去这个实验之旅
<2-6,Leonard>You don't want me going on this research trip

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,770
<2-7,Sheldon>因为你害怕自己独处
<2-7,Sheldon>because you're afraid to be alone.

47
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,970
<2-7,Sheldon>我才不害怕自己独处
<2-7,Sheldon>I'm not afraid to be alone.

48
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,560
<2-7,Sheldon>在陆地就不怕
<2-7,Sheldon>On land.

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,640
<2-7,Sheldon>在海上呢  这就可怕了
<2-7,Sheldon>On the sea, it would be terrifying.

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,900
<2-7,Sheldon>太容易溺死了
<2-7,Sheldon>Because of all the drowning.

51
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,080
<2-8,Leonard>谢尔顿
<2-8,Leonard>Sheldon.

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,680
<2-9,Sheldon>行  我不提溺水了
<2-9,Sheldon>Fine, no more drowning talk.

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,450
<2-9,Sheldon>我换个话题
<2-9,Sheldon>I'll change the subject.

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,160
<2-9,Sheldon>你觉得这两者打架  谁能赢呢
<2-9,Sheldon>Who do you think would win in a fight--

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,560
<2-9,Sheldon>你或鲨鱼
<2-9,Sheldon>you or a shark?

56
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,840
<2-10,Leonard>我感谢你这招牌的
<2-10,Leonard>Look, I appreciate your signature blend

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,260
<2-10,Leonard>"为我着想"与"超级自私"
<2-10,Leonard>of concern for me and incredible selfishness.

58
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,880
<2-10,Leonard>如果我能有机会入选
<2-10,Leonard>If I get the chance to do this,

59
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,890
<2-10,Leonard>你说什么都没办法阻止我去的
<2-10,Leonard>there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me.

60
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,950
<2-11,Sheldon>非常好
<2-11,Sheldon>Very well.

61
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,410
<2-11,Sheldon>你与佩妮的感情现在好到不行
<2-11,Sheldon>Things between you and Penny have never been better.

62
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,750
<2-11,Sheldon>我只希望四个月的分离不会改变这一切
<2-11,Sheldon>I hope four months apart doesn't change anything.

63
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,670
<2-11,Sheldon>我应该先提这件事的对吧
<2-11,Sheldon>I should have opened with that, huh?

64
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,290
<2-11,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<2-11,Sheldon>第六季  第二十四集[本季终]

65
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,100
<3-1,Raj>如果你仔细看向金星
<3-1,Raj>If you look carefully at Venus,

66
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,160
<3-1,Raj>你应该能看见
<3-1,Raj>you should be able to see

67
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,300
<3-1,Raj>国际太空站从它面前经过
<3-1,Raj>the International Space Station pass by.

68
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,550
<3-2,Lucy>你朋友真去过那上面吗
<3-2,Lucy>Your friend was actually up there?

69
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,060
<3-3,Raj>他还带了一件T恤给我  上面写着
<3-3,Raj>Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said,

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,350
<3-3,Raj>"我朋友上了国际太空站
<3-3,Raj>"My Friend Went to the Space Station

71
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,210
<3-3,Raj>而我只有拿到这件傻逼T恤"
<3-3,Raj>and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt""

72
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,330
<3-4,Lucy>-他有带那件T恤上太空吗  -没有
<3-4,Lucy>- Did he take the T-shirt to space? - Nope.

73
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,920
<3-5,Raj>但那衣服绝对够傻逼
<3-5,Raj>It's exactly as lousy as advertised.

74
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,260
<3-5,Raj>说到朋友
<3-5,Raj>Speaking of friends,

75
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,180
<3-5,Raj>我的朋友们想见见你呢
<3-5,Raj>they have been asking to meet you.

76
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,690
<3-5,Raj>我想着或许
<3-5,Raj>I was thinking

77
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,580
<3-5,Raj>有机会我们大家一起聚一聚吧
<3-5,Raj>maybe we could all hang out sometime?

78
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,870
<3-5,Raj>我不知道
<3-5,Raj>I don't know.

79
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,240
<3-6,Lucy>你有多少朋友啊
<3-6,Lucy>How many are there?

80
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,450
<3-7,Raj>我算算  六个
<3-7,Raj>Let's see. Six.

81
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,240
<3-7,Raj>哇  好酷  我有六个朋友呢
<3-7,Raj>That's pretty cool; I have six friends!

82
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,780
<3-7,Raj>有点像西纳特拉
<3-7,Raj>Kind of like Sinatra.

83
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,770
<3-7,Raj>西纳特拉  美国上世纪杰出男歌手
<3-7,Raj>有过一档与7名好友歌唱的节目  名为"西纳特拉与好友们'

84
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,140
<3-8,Lucy>六个陌生人
<3-8,Lucy>Six strangers?

85
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,740
<3-8,Lucy>这压力好大啊
<3-8,Lucy>That's a lot of pressure.

86
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,560
<3-8,Lucy>盯着我看  问我一堆私人问题
<3-8,Lucy>Staring at me, asking me personal questions.

87
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,480
<3-8,Lucy>比如"你做什么工作的"
<3-8,Lucy>Like, "What do you do?"

88
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,940
<3-8,Lucy>"你从哪里来的"
<3-8,Lucy>"Where are you from?"

89
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,860
<3-8,Lucy>"你为什么要把自己锁在厕所里呢"
<3-8,Lucy>"Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?"

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,480
<3-9,Raj>要不你就先见其中一个
<3-9,Raj>Okay, how about you just dip your toe in

91
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,960
<3-9,Raj>看看情况如何
<3-9,Raj>and meet one of them?

92
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,410
<3-10,Lucy>你会来吗
<3-10,Lucy>Will you be there?

93
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,530
<3-11,Raj>当然啊
<3-11,Raj>Of course.

94
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,720
<3-12,Lucy>那就是两个陌生人  算我自己就三个
<3-12,Lucy>Well, that's two. Three if you count me.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,490
<3-12,Lucy>这事情越来越失控了
<3-12,Lucy>Oh, this is getting out of hand.

96
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,710
<4-1,Penny>在我下午上班的时候
<4-1,Penny>So, then, during my afternoon shift,

97
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,620
<4-1,Penny>我不小心把整托盘的饮料全撒身上了
<4-1,Penny>I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.

98
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,740
<4-2,Leonard>好惨啊
<4-2,Leonard>Oh, that's awful.

99
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,490
<4-3,Penny>也没有啦  靠着湿透的衣服
<4-3,Penny>Not really. My shirt was soaking wet.

100
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,190
<4-3,Penny>我拿到了我这辈子最多的小费呢
<4-3,Penny>I got, like, the biggest tip of my life. Oh.

101
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,880
<4-4,Leonard>你还记得我跟你说过有关
<4-4,Leonard>So, listen, do you remember when I said

102
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,420
<4-4,Leonard>广义相对论与流体力学
<4-4,Leonard>the similarities of the equations

103
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,020
<4-4,Leonard>方程中的相似处表示了
<4-4,Leonard>of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest

104
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,810
<4-4,Leonard>在有巨量水源的地方很可能能找到
<4-4,Leonard>you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation

105
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,580
<4-4,Leonard>盎鲁射线的相似物
<4-4,Leonard>in a large body of water?

106
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,810
<4-5,Penny>这不是我跟你说的吗
<4-5,Penny>I thought I said that to you.

107
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,360
<4-5,Penny>总而言之
<4-5,Penny>Anyway,

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,680
<4-6,Leonard>史提芬·霍金的队伍在研究这个
<4-6,Leonard>Stephen Hawking's team is looking into that,

109
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,130
<4-6,Leonard>而他们要请我加入
<4-6,Leonard>and I've been invited to join them.

110
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,580
<4-7,Penny>霍金呢  恭喜你
<4-7,Penny>Wow, Hawking! Good for you!

111
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,570
<4-8,Leonard>是很好
<4-8,Leonard>Well, it is.

112
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,050
<4-8,Leonard>但是  这样我就得离开一阵子
<4-8,Leonard>Just-- you know, I'd be gone for a while.

113
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,170
<4-9,Penny>多久呢
<4-9,Penny>Well, how long?

114
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,390
<4-10,Leonard>三四个月吧
<4-10,Leonard>Three, four months.

115
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,050
<4-11,Penny>-什么时候走  -再过几周吧
<4-11,Penny>- When would you leave? - Couple weeks.

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,530
<4-13,Penny>没事  那我去看你好啦
<4-13,Penny>O-Okay, well, I'll just come visit you.

117
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,610
<4-14,Leonard>这就是问题所在  你不能来
<4-14,Leonard>That's the thing-- you can't.

118
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,550
<4-14,Leonard>因为我会在北海的一艘船上
<4-14,Leonard>I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.

119
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,350
<4-15,Penny>在船上
<4-15,Penny>On a ship?

120
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,190
<4-15,Penny>不怕坐在轮椅上的霍金  会从甲板上滚下去吗
<4-15,Penny>Aren't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?

121
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,840
<4-16,Leonard>他不会去
<4-16,Leonard>Uh, he's not gonna be there.

122
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,920
<4-16,Leonard>他只是派人去研究他的理论
<4-16,Leonard>He's just sending a team to research his theory.

123
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,850
<4-17,Penny>当然
<4-17,Penny>Oh, sure.

124
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,150
<4-17,Penny>就像你派我去打死你浴缸的蜘蛛一样
<4-17,Penny>Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub.

125
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,370
<4-17,Penny>好吧  整整四个月
<4-17,Penny>Okay. Four months.

126
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,840
<4-18,Leonard>是的
<4-18,Leonard>Yeah.

127
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,390
<4-18,Leonard>我有点担心
<4-18,Leonard>And I'm a little worried

128
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,010
<4-18,Leonard>因为咱们俩现在感情这么好
<4-18,Leonard>because things between us have been so great,

129
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,760
<4-18,Leonard>我不想做任何会破坏感情的事情
<4-18,Leonard>and I'd hate to do anything that screws that up.

130
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
<4-19,Penny>亲爱的  一般会破坏感情
<4-19,Penny>Oh, sweetie, if you're gonna screw things up,

131
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,190
<4-19,Penny>都是你在的时候  你不在时万事大吉
<4-19,Penny>it's gonna be while you're here, not while you're away.

132
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,260
<4-19,Penny>没关系  你必须得去
<4-19,Penny>No. I mean, look, you have to go.

133
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,070
<4-19,Penny>听起来这是个很棒的机会
<4-19,Penny>It sounds like an amazing opportunity.

134
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,560
<4-19,Penny>我之所以这么说  是因为
<4-19,Penny>And I'm just basing that on how much

135
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,870
<4-19,Penny>我一点也不懂你刚说的话
<4-19,Penny>I didn't understand what you said about it.

136
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,790
<4-19,Penny>好吧
<4-19,Penny>Okay.

137
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,240
<4-20,Leonard>我明天早上会确认行程安排
<4-20,Leonard>I'll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.

138
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
<4-21,Penny>好  很好
<4-21,Penny>Okay. Good.

139
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,170
<4-22,Leonard>-我需要你帮我做件事  -说吧
<4-22,Leonard>- I do have to ask you one favor. - Sure.

140
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,810
<4-24,Leonard>谢尔顿对我的离开很不安
<4-24,Leonard>Sheldon's nervous about me leaving.

141
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,600
<4-24,Leonard>我不在的时候  记得帮我照顾下他
<4-24,Leonard>Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone.

142
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,310
<4-25,Penny>我不知道
<4-25,Penny>Oh, I don't know.

143
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,980
<4-25,Penny>还记得以前我是怎么照顾你的金鱼的吗
<4-25,Penny>Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?

144
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,330
<4-26,Leonard>那就把谢尔顿冲下马桶  再给我买个新的
<4-26,Leonard>Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.

145
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,370
<5-1,Leonard>真的  你们真没必要帮我弄个告别派对
<5-1,Leonard>Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.

146
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,200
<5-2,Howard>开什么玩笑
<5-2,Howard>Are you kidding me?

147
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,930
<5-2,Howard>人生能有几次跟真正去大海航行的人
<5-2,Howard>How often can you say "bon voyage" to somebody

148
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,210
<5-2,Howard>说"一路[航行]平安"
<5-2,Howard>when they're actually going on a voyage?

149
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,370
<5-3,Amy>你好  拉杰
<5-3,Amy>Hello, Rajesh.

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,600
<5-4,Howard (in Raj accent)>你好  艾米  很高兴见到你
<5-4,Howard (in Raj accent)>Hello, Amy. Nice to see you.

151
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,710
<5-4,Howard (in Raj accent)>那又怎么样  带口音比较好玩嘛
<5-4,Howard (in Raj accent)>What can I say? It's funnier with the accent.

152
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,190
<5-5,Leonard>冰箱里有啤酒
<5-5,Leonard>There's beer in the fridge.

153
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,500
<5-5,Leonard>总之你们真的不必小题大作
<5-5,Leonard>Anyway, you guys really don't need to make a big deal.

154
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,140
<5-6,Sheldon>莱纳德  你太自私了
<5-6,Sheldon>Leonard, you're being selfish.

155
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,500
<5-6,Sheldon>我们必须得举行一个告别仪式  等你死在海里
<5-6,Sheldon>We need to give you a proper send-off so we'll have closure

156
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,300
<5-6,Sheldon>脸被螃蟹吃掉的时候  我们也有个解脱
<5-6,Sheldon>when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.

157
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,900
<5-7,Penny>谢尔顿  麻烦把嘴闭上
<5-7,Penny>Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.

158
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,400
<5-8,Bernadette>霍华德当年上太空那么久
<5-8,Bernadette>You know, one of the things

159
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,840
<5-8,Bernadette>支撑我熬过这段时间的其中一件事
<5-8,Bernadette>that helped me get through Howard being in space

160
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,580
<5-8,Bernadette>就在他走之前跟他结婚
<5-8,Bernadette>for so long was getting married before he left.

161
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,340
<5-9,Penny>伯纳黛特  麻烦把嘴闭上
<5-9,Penny>Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.

162
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,890
<5-9,Penny>好了
<5-9,Penny>Okay.

163
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,950
<5-10,Raj>我有一件事想麻烦大家
<5-10,Raj>I have a request to make.

164
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,350
<5-11,Amy>现在他居然可以说话了
<5-11,Amy>And now he can talk.

165
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,840
<5-11,Amy>我真想切开你的脑子
<5-11,Amy>I want to cut open your brain

166
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,170
<5-11,Amy>看看里面到底是怎么回事
<5-11,Amy>and see what the heck's going on in there.

167
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,180
<5-12,Raj>唯一能检查[进入]我脑子的人是菲尔博士
<5-12,Raj>The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil.

168
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,180
<5-12,Raj>菲尔博士是有博士学位的心理医生
<5-12,Raj>专门在电视上帮别人解决家庭问题

169
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,120
<5-12,Raj>总之
<5-12,Raj>Anyway, I-

170
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,380
<5-12,Raj>我跟我的新女友说要带她来见你们
<5-12,Raj>I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all,

171
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,920
<5-12,Raj>她觉得先见你们其中一个
<5-12,Raj>and she thought it would be easier for her

172
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,410
<5-12,Raj>会比较不让她害怕
<5-12,Raj>to start with just one.

173
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,890
<5-13,Sheldon>我可不知道有没有时间
<5-13,Sheldon>Oh, gee, I don't know.

174
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,150
<5-13,Sheldon>我的日程有点满
<5-13,Sheldon>My schedule's a little busy.

175
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,820
<5-14,Raj>其实我是想让她先见莱纳德
<5-14,Raj>Actually, I was thinking Leonard.

176
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,770
<5-15,Leonard>谢谢  拉杰  我非常荣幸
<5-15,Leonard>Thank you, Raj. I'd be honored.

177
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,440
<5-15,Leonard>我擦咧
<5-15,Leonard>What the hell?

178
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,730
<5-16,Howard>我以为我才是你最好的朋友
<5-16,Howard>I thought I was your best friend.

179
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,070
<5-17,Raj>你是啊  但你的个人特色过于鲜明
<5-17,Raj>You are, but you've got kind of a big personality,

180
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,230
<5-17,Raj>你看你花哨的衣服和那吊儿郎当范儿
<5-17,Raj>with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.

181
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,740
<5-18,Penny>或许先跟女生见面  她会更放松
<5-18,Penny>You know, maybe she'd be more comfortable meeting a girl first.

182
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,210
<5-19,Raj>好主意  伯纳黛特
<5-19,Raj>Good idea. Bernadette?

183
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,030
<5-20,Penny>我擦咧
<5-20,Penny>What the hell?!

184
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
<5-21,Raj>你长得非常漂亮
<5-21,Raj>Well, you're very pretty.

185
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,030
<5-21,Raj>这会让其他女性有威胁感
<5-21,Raj>That could be intimidating to another woman.

186
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,710
<5-22,Penny>也对
<5-22,Penny>Oh, yeah.

187
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,580
<5-23,Bernadette>你觉得我不够漂亮  不会吓着你的女朋友吗
<5-23,Bernadette>Hey, you don't think I'm pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?

188
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,110
<5-24,Howard>冷静  妮妮
<5-24,Howard>Calm down, Bernie.

189
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,190
<5-24,Howard>你非常吓人
<5-24,Howard>You're very scary.

190
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,710
<5-25,Amy>-应该让我去  -为什么
<5-25,Amy>- It should be me. - Why?

191
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,810
<5-26,Raj>好让你开把我脑子切开的玩笑吗
<5-26,Raj>So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?

192
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,430
<5-27,Amy>首先  那可不是开玩笑
<5-27,Amy>A, that was not a joke.

193
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,420
<5-27,Amy>那是个真诚的请求
<5-27,Amy>That was a sincere request.

194
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,060
<5-27,Amy>其次  更重要的是
<5-27,Amy>And B, more importantly,

195
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,850
<5-27,Amy>我曾经是这个小团体中的局外人
<5-27,Amy>I was the outsider to this group,

196
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,190
<5-27,Amy>我知道初次见面的感觉有多可怕
<5-27,Amy>and I know how frightening that can be.

197
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,610
<5-27,Amy>但你们接纳我  让我感受到你们的爱
<5-27,Amy>But you guys took me in and made me feel loved,

198
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,770
<5-27,Amy>就像家人的爱一样
<5-27,Amy>like I was family.

199
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,560
<5-28,Sheldon>好啦  我去就是了
<5-28,Sheldon>Fine, I'll do it.

200
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,110
<6-1,Amy>在我开始跟谢尔顿约会之后
<6-1,Amy>So, after I started dating Sheldon,

201
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,760
<6-1,Amy>我认识了莱纳德  还有其他人
<6-1,Amy>I met Leonard, and then everybody else,

202
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,950
<6-1,Amy>他们都对我非常好
<6-1,Amy>and they've all been so wonderful to me.

203
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,510
<6-2,Lucy>听起来真不错
<6-2,Lucy>That's really nice to hear.

204
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,930
<6-3,Amy>或许下周  我们可以一起聚聚
<6-3,Amy>Maybe next week, we could all get together.

205
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,990
<6-4,Raj>露西  你可以不用回答
<6-4,Raj>Oh, Lucy, you don't have to answer that.

206
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,300
<6-4,Raj>别把她逼到这个份上  她不喜欢这样
<6-4,Raj>Don't put her on the spot. She hates that.

207
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,890
<6-4,Raj>我说得对吗
<6-4,Raj>Am I right?

208
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,000
<6-4,Raj>告诉她你有多不喜欢被人逼着去交际
<6-4,Raj>Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot.

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,230
<6-4,Raj>快啊  告诉她
<6-4,Raj>Go ahead, tell her.

210
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,280
<6-5,Amy>别搭理他
<6-5,Amy>Ignore him.

211
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,200
<6-5,Amy>他有点紧张  因为他觉得我不明白
<6-5,Amy>He's a little nervous 'cause he doesn't think I understand

212
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,990
<6-5,Amy>你社交焦虑症的严重程度
<6-5,Amy>the severity of your social anxiety.

213
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,080
<6-6,Raj>搞毛呀  你疯了吗
<6-6,Raj>What the...? Are you crazy?

214
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,150
<6-6,Raj>你不能跟有社交焦虑症的人
<6-6,Raj>You can't talk about social anxiety

215
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,700
<6-6,Raj>谈论社交焦虑症
<6-6,Raj>to someone who has social anxiety.

216
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,900
<6-6,Raj>这会让他们更加焦虑的
<6-6,Raj>It makes them socially anxious!

217
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,700
<6-7,Amy>不好意思  但我是个神经生物学家
<6-7,Amy>Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist.

218
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,230
<6-7,Amy>我觉得我比你更懂得
<6-7,Amy>I think I'm a little more qualified than you

219
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,990
<6-7,Amy>你女朋友的脑子里的毛病在哪里
<6-7,Amy>to understand what's not working in your girlfriend's brain!

220
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,660
<6-8,Raj>别说她是我的女朋友
<6-8,Raj>Don't call her my girlfriend.

221
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,650
<6-8,Raj>我们还没正式说过
<6-8,Raj>We haven't discussed whether or not

222
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,690
<6-8,Raj>我们到底是不是男女朋友呢
<6-8,Raj>we're girlfriend or boyfriend yet.

223
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,640
<6-8,Raj>既然这话题已经提出来了
<6-8,Raj>Now that it's out there...

224
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,110
<6-8,Raj>你是我的女朋友吗
<6-8,Raj>...are you my girlfriend?

225
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,110
<6-8,Raj>顺便说一下  如果你说"不是"
<6-8,Raj>By the way, if you say no,

226
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,490
<6-8,Raj>那我会伤心郁闷一辈子哦
<6-8,Raj>I'll never be happy again.

227
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,580
<6-8,Raj>我可不是逼你哦
<6-8,Raj>Not to put you on the spot.

228
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
<6-9,Lucy>我想去个厕所
<6-9,Lucy>I think I have to go to the bathroom.

229
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,820
<6-10,Raj>我们可以先开始吃了
<6-10,Raj>We might as well go ahead and eat.

230
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,950
<6-10,Raj>她短时间内不会回来了
<6-10,Raj>She's not coming back anytime soon.

231
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,760
<7-1,Sheldon>真是可笑
<7-1,Sheldon>This is ridiculous.

232
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,940
<7-1,Sheldon>我们为派对购物
<7-1,Sheldon>We're shopping for a party.

233
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,040
<7-1,Sheldon>可这商店都没有"派对专区"
<7-1,Sheldon>This store doesn't even have a party section.

234
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,440
<7-2,Penny>有的有的  就在这儿
<7-2,Penny>Yeah, it does, and here we are.

235
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,110
<7-3,Sheldon>佩妮  我不得不说
<7-3,Sheldon>You know, I have to say, Penny,

236
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,180
<7-3,Sheldon>我真不明白你怎么会
<7-3,Sheldon>I don't understand why you of all people

237
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,350
<7-3,Sheldon>鼓励莱纳德去那个项目
<7-3,Sheldon>are encouraging Leonard to do this.

238
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,160
<7-4,Penny>我是他的女朋友  当然要支持他啦
<7-4,Penny>Well, I'm his girlfriend; of course I'm gonna support him.

239
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,730
<7-5,Sheldon>你只是他现在的女朋友而已嘛
<7-5,Sheldon>Yeah, well, you're his girlfriend for now.

240
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,160
<7-5,Sheldon>你可能还不了解形势
<7-5,Sheldon>You know, maybe you're not aware of this,

241
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,860
<7-5,Sheldon>但根据悠久的传统
<7-5,Sheldon>but there is a rich tradition

242
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,740
<7-5,Sheldon>出海人很能在他人的双臂双腿间找寻安慰
<7-5,Sheldon>of men at sea finding comfort in each other's arms and britches.

243
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,180
<7-6,Penny>亲爱的  这对莱纳德很重要
<7-6,Penny>Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay?

244
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,740
<7-6,Penny>他将会与史蒂芬·霍金共事
<7-6,Penny>He gets to work with Stephen Hawking.

245
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,670
<7-6,Penny>另外  霍金不会上船
<7-6,Penny>Who, by the way, will not be on the boat.

246
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,840
<7-6,Penny>我查清了
<7-6,Penny>I checked it out.

247
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,800
<7-7,Sheldon>这机会也不算千载难逢
<7-7,Sheldon>It's not that big of an opportunity.

248
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,730
<7-7,Sheldon>就算霍金的理论是正确的
<7-7,Sheldon>And even if Hawking's theories are correct,

249
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,360
<7-7,Sheldon>那他证明也无非是宇宙是从哪来的
<7-7,Sheldon>all they prove is where the universe came from,

250
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,860
<7-7,Sheldon>万物存在的原因及宇宙的尽头
<7-7,Sheldon>why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be.

251
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,410
<7-7,Sheldon>而我
<7-7,Sheldon>I mean, me?

252
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,840
<7-7,Sheldon>我感兴趣的是更宏观的问题
<7-7,Sheldon>I'm interested in the big questions.

253
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,380
<7-8,Penny>上帝啊  天才谢尔顿竟然嫉妒莱纳德
<7-8,Penny>Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.

254
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,100
<7-9,Sheldon>我才没嫉妒
<7-9,Sheldon>I'm not jealous.

255
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,770
<7-9,Sheldon>我只是不开心
<7-9,Sheldon>I'm just very unhappy

256
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,970
<7-9,Sheldon>好事情发生在他身上
<7-9,Sheldon>that good things are happening for him

257
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,080
<7-9,Sheldon>却没我的份
<7-9,Sheldon>and not happening for me.

258
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,940
<7-10,Penny>亲爱的  有这种感觉很正常
<7-10,Penny>Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay?

259
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,990
<7-10,Penny>但莱纳德身上有好事发生
<7-10,Penny>But just because good things are happening to Leonard

260
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,860
<7-10,Penny>不代表你会损失什么啊
<7-10,Penny>doesn't take anything away from you.

261
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,410
<7-10,Penny>我给你讲个故事吧
<7-10,Penny>You know what? Let me tell you a little story.

262
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,650
<7-10,Penny>从前有个在起司工厂工作的女孩
<7-10,Penny>Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory,

263
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,180
<7-10,Penny>她对自己的工作不怎么擅长
<7-10,Penny>and she wasn't very good at her job.

264
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,340
<7-11,Sheldon>-是你  -不是我
<7-11,Sheldon>- It was you. - It wasn't me.

265
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,240
<7-12,Penny>但她同样也是个演员
<7-12,Penny>But she was also an actress,

266
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,600
<7-12,Penny>我们都是某支牙膏广告的
<7-12,Penny>and we were both up for the same part

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,820
<7-12,Penny>候选人
<7-12,Penny>in a toothpaste commercial.

268
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,780
<7-12,Penny>她拿到了  我特别嫉妒
<7-12,Penny>She got it. Look, I was so jealous.

269
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,560
<7-12,Penny>但我没有扯掉她那一头假冒的金发
<7-12,Penny>But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair...

270
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
<7-13,Sheldon>你扯掉了自己那一头假冒的金发
<7-13,Sheldon>You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.

271
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,100
<7-13,Sheldon>我
<7-13,Sheldon>I...

272
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,260
<7-14,Penny>看着她的眼睛
<7-14,Penny>looked her in the eye,

273
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,550
<7-14,Penny>笑着说  "我真为你高兴"
<7-14,Penny>smiled and said, "I'm happy for you."

274
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,620
<7-14,Penny>因为朋友就该这样
<7-14,Penny>Because that's what friends do.

275
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,470
<7-15,Sheldon>-为了不显得小气而说谎  -对
<7-15,Sheldon>- They lie so they don't look petty. - Yeah.

276
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,800
<7-18,Penny>-要怎么做  -像这样
<7-18,Penny>- How? - Like this.

277
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,700
<7-18,Penny>我太为你开心了
<7-18,Penny>I am so happy for you.

278
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,090
<7-19,Sheldon>怪不得牙膏广告没选上你
<7-19,Sheldon>No wonder you didn't get that toothpaste commercial.

279
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,700
<8-2,Lucy>我想为艾米昨晚的表现道歉
<8-2,Lucy>I want to apologize for Amy last night.

280
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,250
<8-3,Raj>她太过分了
<8-3,Raj>She was completely out of line.

281
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,690
<8-3,Raj>是你没说话
<8-3,Raj>Are you... are you not speaking to me

282
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,780
<8-3,Raj>还是画面又卡住了
<8-3,Raj>or did the screen freeze again?

283
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,010
<8-4,Lucy>根本不关艾米的事
<8-4,Lucy>Amy wasn't the problem.

284
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,670
<8-5,Raj>好吧  我知道
<8-5,Raj>Okay. I know.

285
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,340
<8-5,Raj>是我不好
<8-5,Raj>It was me.

286
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,930
<8-5,Raj>我把你逼得太紧了  对不起
<8-5,Raj>I-I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.

287
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,410
<8-6,Lucy>谢谢理解
<8-6,Lucy>Thank you.

288
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,580
<8-7,Raj>我在想
<8-7,Raj>You know, I-I've been thinking that...

289
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,310
<8-7,Raj>也许一对一地见他们太让人紧张了
<8-7,Raj>maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense,

290
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,560
<8-7,Raj>所以
<8-7,Raj>so...

291
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,480
<8-7,Raj>我的朋友们周五会举办个派对
<8-7,Raj>Friday night, my friends are having a party.

292
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,470
<8-8,Lucy>-派对  -小型的
<8-8,Lucy>- A party? - A little one!

293
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,730
<8-9,Raj>是为了给莱纳德饯行
<8-9,Raj>It's-it's a farewell for Leonard,

294
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,250
<8-9,Raj>所以大家只会关注他
<8-9,Raj>so all the attention will be on him.

295
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,550
<8-9,Raj>如果你穿棕色的衣服  往沙发上一坐
<8-9,Raj>If you wear something brown and sit on the couch,

296
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,460
<8-9,Raj>他们压根就不会发现你的存在
<8-9,Raj>they won't even know you're there.

297
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,530
<8-10,Lucy>我不确定
<8-10,Lucy>I'm not sure.

298
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,320
<8-11,Raj>-拜托了  -拉杰
<8-11,Raj>- Oh, please? - Raj.

299
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,950
<8-13,Raj>拜托啦  真要让我求你啊
<8-13,Raj>Come on. Don't make me beg.

300
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,570
<8-13,Raj>我来自印度  我可懂怎么求人了
<8-13,Raj>And I'm from India, so I know how to do it.

301
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,220
<8-14,Lucy>好吧
<8-14,Lucy>Okay.

302
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,340
<8-14,Lucy>谢谢
<8-14,Lucy>Y... Thank you!

303
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,860
<8-15,Raj>这对我意义重大
<8-15,Raj>Th-This means a lot to me.

304
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,680
<8-15,Raj>我的朋友就像家人一样
<8-15,Raj>My friends are like my family.

305
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:31,780
<8-15,Raj>除非你不喜欢他们
<8-15,Raj>Unless you don't like them;

306
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,940
<8-15,Raj>那样的话  他们对我毫无意义
<8-15,Raj>in which case, they're dead to me.

307
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,370
<9-1,Bernadette>你以前在船上长时间待过吗
<9-1,Bernadette>So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?

308
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,910
<9-3,Bernadette>-待过  -你说的是那次
<9-3,Bernadette>- Yeah. - Are you referring to the time

309
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,280
<9-3,Bernadette>我们在迪士尼玩小小世界的时候船卡住不动吗
<9-3,Bernadette>we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?

310
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,450
<9-4,Leonard>是的
<9-4,Leonard>Yeah.

311
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,630
<9-5,Howard>你真让我自豪  莱纳德
<9-5,Howard>I'm proud of you, Leonard.

312
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,340
<9-5,Howard>在北海工作几个月
<9-5,Howard>Working out on the North Sea for months--

313
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,750
<9-5,Howard>-这可真了不起  -我知道
<9-5,Howard>- that's really something. - I know.

314
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,180
<9-6,Leonard>不管科学研究得如何
<9-6,Leonard>As far as science goes,

315
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,620
<9-6,Leonard>这可是百年不遇的经历啊
<9-6,Leonard>this is the adventure of a lifetime.

316
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,010
<9-7,Howard>对你可能是的
<9-7,Howard>Maybe your lifetime.

317
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,870
<9-7,Howard>反正我是去过太空了
<9-7,Howard>I went to space.

318
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,590
<9-8,Leonard>这可没什么可比的
<9-8,Leonard>It's not a competition.

319
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,080
<9-8,Leonard>你说得对
<9-8,Leonard>You're right, you're right.

320
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,490
<9-9,Howard>我真为你感到骄傲
<9-9,Howard>I'm really proud of you, and...

321
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,780
<9-9,Howard>你去了以后我会想你的
<9-9,Howard>I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

322
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,520
<9-9,Howard>另外太空可比大海牛
<9-9,Howard>And space beats water.

323
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,090
<9-10,Amy>拉杰什  我以为露西会来呢
<9-10,Amy>Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.

324
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,720
<9-11,Raj>她要来的  只不过稍微迟到了点
<9-11,Raj>She is. She's just running a little late.

325
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,890
<9-11,Raj>你知道的  女孩子出门总要花时间
<9-11,Raj>You know how it is-- girls always fussing about

326
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,460
<9-11,Raj>弄头发啊  化妆啊啥的
<9-11,Raj>their hair, their makeup.

327
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,670
<9-11,Raj>她会来的
<9-11,Raj>She'll be here.

328
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,530
<9-11,Raj>别老问了  好吗
<9-11,Raj>Just give it a rest, okay?

329
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,790
<9-12,Sheldon>大家请注意
<9-12,Sheldon>Um, can I have your attention, everyone?

330
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,570
<9-12,Sheldon>给没有绝对音感的人  这是降B调
<9-12,Sheldon>That's, uh, B-flat, for those who don't have perfect pitch.

331
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
<9-12,Sheldon>我想给我最好的朋友
<9-12,Sheldon>I would like to propose a toast

332
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,420
<9-12,Sheldon>莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德敬一杯酒
<9-12,Sheldon>to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

333
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,140
<9-12,Sheldon>他现在得到了一个弥足珍贵的机会
<9-12,Sheldon>He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity,

334
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,360
<9-12,Sheldon>我非常为他高兴
<9-12,Sheldon>and I couldn't be happier for him.

335
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,280
<9-13,Leonard>谢谢  谢尔顿
<9-13,Leonard>Thank you, Sheldon.

336
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,400
<9-13,Leonard>你能说出这话真不容易
<9-13,Leonard>That must've been very hard for you to say.

337
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,280
<9-14,Sheldon>我是真心的
<9-14,Sheldon>Well, I mean it.

338
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,000
<9-14,Sheldon>我真的很为你高兴
<9-14,Sheldon>I'm really happy for you.

339
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,770
<9-14,Sheldon>你得这样才能拿下那牙膏广告  干杯
<9-14,Sheldon>And that's how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.

340
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,340
<9-15,Howard>干杯
<9-15,Howard>Cheers.

341
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,580
<9-17,Howard>你能为莱纳德高兴  真是不错
<9-17,Howard>It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.

342
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,640
<9-18,Sheldon>谢谢
<9-18,Sheldon>Thank you.

343
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,190
<9-19,Howard>我上太空时  你肯定是眼红到不行吧
<9-19,Howard>It must've killed you when I went to space.

344
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,040
<9-20,Raj (Looking at phone)>不好
<9-20,Raj (Looking at phone)>Oh, no.

345
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,260
<9-21,Howard>兄弟  没事吧
<9-21,Howard>Buddy, you okay?

346
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,240
<9-21,Howard>老天
<9-21,Howard>Oh, man.

347
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,910
<9-22,Bernadette>出什么事了
<9-22,Bernadette>What's going on?

348
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,730
<9-23,Raj>念出来吧
<9-23,Raj>Uh, go ahead. Read it.

349
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,930
<9-24,Howard>"拉杰  我不能来参加派对
<9-24,Howard>"Raj, I can't come to the party.

350
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,940
<9-24,Howard>这对我来说  难以承受
<9-24,Howard>This is all just too much for me.

351
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,880
<9-24,Howard>我觉得我们还是不要再见面了
<9-24,Howard>I don't think we should see each other anymore.

352
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,170
<9-24,Howard>对不起  露西"
<9-24,Howard>Sorry. Lucy."

353
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,940
<9-25,Raj>失陪下

<11-17,Penny>-你在和我说话  -是的
<11-17,Penny>- You're talking to me. - I am.

424
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,640
<11-18,Raj>现在我为了完全不同的原因痛哭流涕了
<11-18,Raj>And now I'm crying for a whole different reason!

425
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,190
<11-18,Raj>我也是
<11-18,Raj>Me, too!

426
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,680
<12-1,Raj>我想我要说的就是
<12-1,Raj>So I-I guess what I'm saying is.

427
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,580
<12-1,Raj>我理解露西的出发点
<12-1,Raj>I get where Lucy's coming from.

428
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,330
<12-2,Penny>很好  要来杯红酒吗
<12-2,Penny>That's great. Do you want some wine?

429
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,780
<12-3,Raj>不用  喝水就行了
<12-3,Raj>Uh, no, water's fine.

430
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,550
<12-3,Raj>总之  我想了很多
<12-3,Raj>Anyhow, I-I've been thinking about it a lot,

431
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,500
<12-3,Raj>我完全理解露西为什么这样做
<12-3,Raj>and-and I totally see why Lucy did what she did.

432
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,420
<12-3,Raj>我给的压力太大了
<12-3,Raj>I pushed too hard.

433
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,440
<12-3,Raj>如果我稍稍放手  给她足够的空间
<12-3,Raj>But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space,

434
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,590
<12-3,Raj>也许我们之间还有未来可言
<12-3,Raj>maybe there's still a future for us.

435
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,450
<12-3,Raj>人生好笑的地方就在于
<12-3,Raj>Yeah, the funny thing about life is that,

436
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,350
<12-3,Raj>有时候...
<12-3,Raj>you know, sometimes...

437
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,840
<12-4,Amy>他还会闭嘴吗
<12-4,Amy>Does he ever shut up?

438
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,550
<12-5,Raj>然后  事情又出现转机
<12-5,Raj>And then, it turns good again,

439
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,830
<12-5,Raj>这比一帆风顺的感觉又会好些
<12-5,Raj>that means it better than if never been bad for a while,

440
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,020
<12-5,Raj>现在  情况就是
<12-5,Raj>and now, things are going...

441
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,830
<12-5,Raj>非常非常的糟糕
<12-5,Raj>in fact, are very very bad.

442
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,960
<12-5,Raj>但至少我的心开始愈合了
<12-5,Raj>But at least my heart is starting to heal.

443
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,620
<12-5,Raj>一步步地慢慢愈合
<12-5,Raj>Slowly but surely.

444
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,870
<12-5,Raj>开始我那叫哭得一个惨啊
<12-5,Raj>And how I cried.

445
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,900
<12-5,Raj>我的脸上就好像来了场暴风雨
<12-5,Raj>It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face.

446
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,270
<12-5,Raj>但我好歹算个男人
<12-5,Raj>But I'm a man, okay?

447
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,450
<12-5,Raj>我需要收拾心情  拿起笔
<12-5,Raj>So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen

448
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,060
<12-5,Raj>把一切心情都写在日记上
<12-5,Raj>and get it all out in my journal.

449
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,370
<12-5,Raj>而且并不全是坏事  对吗
<12-5,Raj>I mean, it's not all bad, right?

450
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,550
<12-5,Raj>我心碎的结果
<12-5,Raj>Having my heart broken

451
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,300
<12-5,Raj>就是令我终于能在你们面前滔滔不绝
<12-5,Raj>has allowed me to finally speak in front of you...

452
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,500
<12-5,Raj>瞧  我终于找到了乌云背后的幸福线
<12-5,Raj>so, you know, it was a silver lining.
