1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,690
<1-1,Penny>你在忙什么呢
<1-1,Penny>What are you working on?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,500
<1-2,Sheldon>没空说话  专注模式中
<1-2,Sheldon>Can't talk. In the zone.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,320
<1-3,Penny>你知道他在忙什么吗
<1-3,Penny>Do you know what he's doing?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,280
<1-4,Amy>有各种可能
<1-4,Amy>Could be anything.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,310
<1-4,Amy>上次像这样时
<1-4,Amy>Last time he was like this,

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,810
<1-4,Amy>他解决了石墨烯中的电子传递问题
<1-4,Amy>he figured out electron transport in graphene.

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,180
<1-4,Amy>再之前的那次  他列了一张
<1-4,Amy>The time before that, he was making a list

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,040
<1-4,Amy>如果他有树屋  谁可以上去玩的名单
<1-4,Amy>of who's allowed in his tree fort if he ever gets one.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,490
<1-4,Amy>至今不敢相信我居然落选了
<1-4,Amy>Still can't believe I didn't make the cut.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,890
<1-5,Penny>谢尔顿  要休息一下吗
<1-5,Penny>Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break?

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,620
<1-5,Penny>吃的来了哦
<1-5,Penny>Your food's ready.

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,540
<1-6,Leonard>别这样  你干什么呢
<1-6,Leonard>No, no, what are you doing?

13
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,840
<1-6,Leonard>他现在既开心又安静
<1-6,Leonard>He's both happy and quiet.

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,240
<1-6,Leonard>就像同时看到独角兽和大野人一样罕见
<1-6,Leonard>It's like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,200
<1-7,Howard>抱歉我们来晚了
<1-7,Howard>Sorry we're so late.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
<1-7,Howard>伯纳黛特工作太忙走不开
<1-7,Howard>Bernadette got stuck at work.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,840
<1-9,Raj>重大好消息
<1-9,Raj>Great news!

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,310
<1-8,Bernadette>一种浣熊病毒刚刚打破了种族障碍
<1-8,Bernadette>A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier

19
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,830
<1-8,Bernadette>现在可以传染给人类了
<1-8,Bernadette>and now can infect humans!

20
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,420
<1-9,Raj>这算什么重大好消息
<1-9,Raj>Why is that great news?

21
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,420
<1-10,Bernadette>在医药界我们有种说法
<1-10,Bernadette>In the pharmaceutical business, we have a saying:

22
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,500
<1-10,Bernadette>"传染越多  赚钱越多"
<1-10,Bernadette>"Mo' infections, mo' money."

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,800
<1-10,Bernadette>等等
<1-10,Bernadette>Wait!

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,940
<1-11,Howard>你还是先洗洗
<1-11,Howard>Maybe you want to wash

25
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,670
<1-11,Howard>你那双小浣熊爪子吧
<1-11,Howard>your little raccoon hands first.

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,150
<1-12,Bernadette>放轻松
<1-12,Bernadette>Oh, calm down.

27
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,320
<1-12,Bernadette>我要是真感染了  早就挂了
<1-12,Bernadette>If I had it, I'd be dead already.

28
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,470
<1-13,Howard>各位听我说
<1-13,Howard>Guys, listen up.

29
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,420
<1-14,Sheldon>没空听  专注模式中
<1-14,Sheldon>Can't listen, zone.

30
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,760
<1-14,Sheldon>同时也不感兴趣
<1-14,Sheldon>Also don't care.

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,860
<1-15,Howard>下周是我和伯纳黛特初次约会的周年纪念
<1-15,Howard>Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.

32
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,620
<1-16,Sheldon>彻底不感兴趣
<1-16,Sheldon>Really don't care.

33
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,630
<1-17,Howard>我想来点特殊的惊喜
<1-17,Howard>I want to do something special,

34
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,400
<1-17,Howard>希望大家能够一起参与
<1-17,Howard>and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,130
<1-18,Penny>你是干了什么坏事  现在想要弥补吧
<1-18,Penny>Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?

36
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,300
<1-19,Howard>我不过是先存点额度
<1-19,Howard>Just putting something in the bank

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,870
<1-19,Howard>留着下次干坏事时用
<1-19,Howard>for what horrible thing I do next.

38
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,010
<1-20,Penny>趁她还没回来  先说我的计划
<1-20,Penny>Look, she's gonna be back any second, so here's the deal:

39
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,070
<1-21,Howard>我在写一首歌
<1-21,Howard>I'm writing a song, and I was hoping

40
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,960
<1-21,Howard>希望可以大家演奏给她听
<1-21,Howard>we could all play it for her together.

41
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,300
<1-23,Amy>我喜欢这主意
<1-23,Amy>Oh, I love that.

42
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,150
<1-24,Raj>太有爱了
<1-24,Raj>That is so beautiful.

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,340
<1-25,Howard>谢尔顿
<1-25,Howard>Sheldon?

44
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,480
<1-26,Sheldon>我们什么时候来的芝士蛋糕工厂
<1-26,Sheldon>When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?

45
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,990
<1-26,Sheldon>人人影视
<1-26,Sheldon>YYeTs.com

52
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,310
<1-26,Sheldon>生活大爆炸

53
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,030
<2-1,Leonard>霍华德想给伯纳黛特的惊喜真有心
<2-1,Leonard>It's really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.

54
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,870
<2-1,Leonard>对啊
<2-1,Leonard>Yeah.

55
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,490
<2-2,Penny>你怎么就从没做点浪漫的事
<2-2,Penny>Hey, how come you've never done anything romantic

56
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,380
<2-2,Penny>来庆祝我们的初次约会呢
<2-2,Penny>to celebrate our first date?

57
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,440
<2-3,Leonard>首先  你甩我的次数太多
<2-3,Leonard>Well, for starters, you've broken up with me so many times,

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,790
<2-3,Leonard>你的初次约会是指哪一次呢
<2-3,Leonard>which first date are we talking about?

59
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,570
<2-4,Sheldon>这巴掌打得太响了
<2-4,Sheldon>Ooh, somebody call the burn ward.

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,280
<2-4,Sheldon>重回专注模式中
<2-4,Sheldon>And back to the zone.

61
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,360
<2-5,Leonard>再说了  我经常为你制造浪漫呀
<2-5,Leonard>And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time.

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
<2-5,Leonard>倒是你能想出为我做过什么浪漫的事吗
<2-5,Leonard>Can you even name one romantic thing you've done for me?

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,690
<2-6,Penny>我做过的可多了
<2-6,Penny>I can name tons.

64
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,080
<2-7,Leonard>床事不算
<2-7,Leonard>Sex doesn't count.

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,630
<2-8,Penny>对了  上次我们去住民宿算吧
<2-8,Penny>I know, what about that Bed-and-Breakfast?

66
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,910
<2-9,Leonard>是我带你去的
<2-9,Leonard>Well, I took you there.

67
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,620
<2-9,Leonard>你所做的就只有...
<2-9,Leonard>All you did was...

68
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,570
<2-10,Penny>我很清楚自己做了什么
<2-10,Penny>I know what I did.

69
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,430
<2-10,Penny>我估计他们得把那摇摇椅丢掉了
<2-10,Penny>I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair.

70
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,270
<2-10,Penny>要是我愿意  我也能变得很浪漫
<2-10,Penny>You know, I can be romantic if I want to.

71
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,730
<2-11,Leonard>没关系啦
<2-11,Leonard>It's fine.

72
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,620
<2-11,Leonard>你能浪漫才怪
<2-11,Leonard>And also not true.

73
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,330
<2-12,Penny>算了  你就等着瞧吧
<2-12,Penny>Okay, just you wait and see.

74
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,970
<2-12,Penny>我非浪漫得你魂飞魄散不可
<2-12,Penny>I'm gonna romance your freakin' ass off.

75
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,020
<2-12,Penny>这话真动听
<2-12,Penny>That's beautiful.

76
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,860
<2-13,Leonard>敢问是莎士比亚的名言吗
<2-13,Leonard>Is that Shakespeare?

77
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,300
<2-14,Penny>谢尔顿
<2-14,Penny>Sheldon?

78
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,980
<2-15,Sheldon>模式中
<2-15,Sheldon>Zone.

79
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,790
<2-16,Leonard>等他从屋顶摔下来  就会知道自己走过了
<2-16,Leonard>He'll figure it out when he falls off the roof.

80
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,550
<2-16,Leonard>谢尔顿  我知道你沉浸在模式中
<2-16,Leonard>Sheldon, I know you're in the zone,

81
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,340
<3-1,Leonard>但你要喝茶吗
<3-1,Leonard>but do you want some tea?

82
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,660
<3-1,Leonard>好吧  真不敢相信我要这么说
<3-1,Leonard>All right, I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

83
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,350
<3-1,Leonard>你好几个小时都没说过话了
<3-1,Leonard>but you haven't spoken in hours

84
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,280
<3-1,Leonard>我开始有点担心了
<3-1,Leonard>and I'm starting to get worried.

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,560
<3-1,Leonard>拜托你说点什么吧
<3-1,Leonard>Please say something.

86
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,220
<3-2,Sheldon>莱纳德  准备好五体投地
<3-2,Sheldon>Leonard, prepare to be humbled

87
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,210
<3-2,Sheldon>被本座的无上智慧吓哭吧
<3-2,Sheldon>and weep at the glory of my genius.

88
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,140
<3-3,Leonard>我错了  你还是不说话的好
<3-3,Leonard>Nope, it was better before.

89
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,370
<3-4,Sheldon>看看这白板
<3-4,Sheldon>Look at it.

90
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,530
<3-4,Sheldon>感觉就像我的智商生下了个娃
<3-4,Sheldon>I feel like my mind just made a baby.

91
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,850
<3-4,Sheldon>多可爱的宝宝啊
<3-4,Sheldon>And it's beautiful.

92
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,050
<3-4,Sheldon>它和人类宝宝不一样
<3-4,Sheldon>It's not like human babies,

93
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,040
<3-4,Sheldon>不会大吵大哭  浑身覆盖黏糊糊的液体
<3-4,Sheldon>which are loud and covered in goop.

94
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,060
<3-5,Leonard>我的上帝啊  谢尔顿
<3-5,Leonard>Holy crap, Sheldon,

95
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,710
<3-5,Leonard>你这是想出了一个办法
<3-5,Leonard>did you just figure out a method

96
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,690
<3-5,Leonard>可以人工合成一种新型稳定超重元素吗
<3-5,Leonard>for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?

97
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,870
<3-5,Leonard>是吗
<3-5,Leonard>Did I?

98
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,500
<3-6,Sheldon>这不可能呀
<3-6,Sheldon>Well, that can't be right.

99
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,920
<3-6,Sheldon>从来没有人成功过呢
<3-6,Sheldon>No one's ever done that before.

100
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,790
<3-6,Sheldon>除了我  我想出来了
<3-6,Sheldon>Except me, because I just did it!

101
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,020
<3-6,Sheldon>谢尔顿谢尔顿脑力无边
<3-6,Sheldon>Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

105
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,740
<3-6,Sheldon>谢尔顿谢尔顿
<3-6,Sheldon>Sheldon and his brain...

106
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,500
<3-7,Leonard>没错  还是不说话的好
<3-7,Leonard>Yeah, definitely better before.

107
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,110
<4-1,Howard>我给伯纳黛特写的歌快完工了
<4-1,Howard>So I'm almost done writing the song for Bernadette.

108
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,460
<4-1,Howard>你拉大提琴行吗
<4-1,Howard>Are you cool playing the cello?

109
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,250
<4-2,Leonard>如果你是指乐意的"行"  那我可以
<4-2,Leonard>If by "cool" you mean "willing to," Yes.

110
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,710
<4-2,Leonard>如果是指我拉琴有"型"
<4-2,Leonard>If by "cool" You mean "cool,"

111
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,850
<4-2,Leonard>那你绝对是没见我拉大提琴的样子
<4-2,Leonard>clearly you've never seen me play the cello.

112
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,710
<4-3,Howard>很好  那你弹尤克里里琴吧
<4-3,Howard>Great. Will you play the ukulele?

113
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,960
<4-4,Raj>好啊  我非常乐意炫一下我的速技
<4-4,Raj>Of course. I'd be happy to shred it on my ax.

114
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,310
<4-5,Howard>要不就弹你那把小得出奇的傻逼吉他也行
<4-5,Howard>Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.

115
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,570
<4-6,Raj>好啦  我会弹得她心醉...
<4-6,Raj>Fine. I will melt her heart.

116
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,680
<4-6,Raj>脸也碎的
<4-6,Raj>And her face!

117
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,380
<4-7,Sheldon>各位先生
<4-7,Sheldon>Gentlemen.

118
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,780
<4-7,Sheldon>你们都听说了我的小突破吧
<4-7,Sheldon>Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough.

119
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,100
<4-7,Sheldon>如果你们计划
<4-7,Sheldon>Now, if your plan

120
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,940
<4-7,Sheldon>把我抬在肩上
<4-7,Sheldon>is to hoist me on your shoulders

121
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,600
<4-7,Sheldon>在小餐厅里游行一周  还请你们尽量不要
<4-7,Sheldon>and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain.

122
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,850
<4-7,Sheldon>我个人不喜欢高处  我有晕动病
<4-7,Sheldon>I don't care for heights, motion sickness

123
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,700
<4-7,Sheldon>也不喜欢让你们的脖子蹭我的尊臀
<4-7,Sheldon>or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks.

124
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,080
<4-8,Howard>说真的  恭喜你  谢尔顿
<4-8,Howard>Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.

125
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,540
<4-9,Raj>我在网上看到了你的论文
<4-9,Raj>Yeah, I read your paper online.

126
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,450
<4-9,Raj>创造一种新的重元素的方法相当启发人
<4-9,Raj>That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.

127
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,350
<4-10,Sheldon>谢谢
<4-10,Sheldon>Oh, well, thank you.

128
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,270
<4-10,Sheldon>信不信由你
<4-10,Sheldon>Believe it or not,

129
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,760
<4-10,Sheldon>我刚得知中国湖北
<4-10,Sheldon>I just learned a Chinese research team

130
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,500
<4-10,Sheldon>核子物理研究所的研究小组
<4-10,Sheldon>at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,380
<4-10,Sheldon>在回旋加速器上进行了测试
<4-10,Sheldon>ran a test on a cyclotron,

132
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,410
<4-10,Sheldon>结果相当喜人
<4-10,Sheldon>and the results were extremely promising.

133
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,760
<4-11,Leonard>-谢尔顿  太不可思议了  -我知道
<4-11,Leonard>- Sheldon, that's incredible. - Yeah, I know!

134
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,020
<4-12,Sheldon>他们称之为自共产党成立后最伟大的事
<4-12,Sheldon>They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party.

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,280
<4-12,Sheldon>不过我相当确信
<4-12,Sheldon>Although I'm pretty sure that

136
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,250
<4-12,Sheldon>是共产党让他们这样说的
<4-12,Sheldon>the Communist party made them say that.

137
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,940
<4-12,Sheldon>我爱中国
<4-12,Sheldon>I like China.

138
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,680
<4-12,Sheldon>他们知道如何让人守规矩
<4-12,Sheldon>See, they know how to keep people in line.

139
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,260
<4-13,Howard>接下来会怎样
<4-13,Howard>So, what happens next?

140
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,220
<4-14,Sheldon>更多的测试  更多的成功  更多的名望
<4-14,Sheldon>Oh, more testing, more success, more fame.

141
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,100
<4-14,Sheldon>别担心
<4-14,Sheldon>But don't worry,

142
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,220
<4-14,Sheldon>我会一如既往保持那颗踏踏实实的
<4-14,Sheldon>I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe

143
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,070
<4-14,Sheldon>谦卑之心
<4-14,Sheldon>I've always been.

144
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,830
<4-15,Leonard>-太好了  -是的
<4-15,Leonard>- Good to know. - Yeah.

145
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,530
<4-16,Sheldon>你的饼干本皇要了
<4-16,Sheldon>Now give me that cookie;

146
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,830
<4-16,Sheldon>我发现了新元素
<4-16,Sheldon>I discovered an element.

147
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,490
<5-1,Penny>感谢你能来
<5-1,Penny>Thank you so much for coming.

148
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,510
<5-2,Raj>你找对人了
<5-2,Raj>You called the right person.

149
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,280
<5-2,Raj>我相信我能设计出一个完美的浪漫之夜
<5-2,Raj>I believe I have the perfect romantic evening

150
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,380
<5-2,Raj>让你送给莱纳德
<5-2,Raj>for you to give Leonard.

151
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,720
<5-3,Penny>太好了  因为我真的是没辙了
<5-3,Penny>Okay, good, 'cause I've been really struggling with this.

152
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,980
<5-4,Raj>我相信你知道
<5-4,Raj>As I'm sure you're aware,

153
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,870
<5-4,Raj>最快的抓住男人心的方法是俘获他的...
<5-4,Raj>the quickest way to a man's heart is through his...

154
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,560
<5-5,Penny>"裤裆"  但莱纳德说床事不算
<5-5,Penny>Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn't count.

155
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,530
<5-6,Raj>可怜的女人
<5-6,Raj>You poor thing.

156
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,710
<5-6,Raj>箭袋里只有一支箭
<5-6,Raj>You have one arrow in your quiver,

157
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,460
<5-6,Raj>却被禁止使用
<5-6,Raj>and you just can't use it.

158
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,230
<5-6,Raj>幸运的是  另一个抓住男人心的方法是
<5-6,Raj>Fortunately, another pathway to a man's heart

159
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,480
<5-6,Raj>俘获他的胃
<5-6,Raj>is through his stomach.

160
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,070
<5-7,Penny>我不太愿意给他做饭
<5-7,Penny>I don't know if I want to cook for him;

161
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,470
<5-7,Penny>他在吃方面很挑剔
<5-7,Penny>he's kind of a picky eater.

162
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,960
<5-7,Penny>总是说  "太咸了"
<5-7,Penny>I mean, "It's too salty.

163
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,130
<5-7,Penny>"太干了"
<5-7,Penny>It's too dry.

164
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,590
<5-7,Penny>"这玩意简直是冻与焦之歌啊"
<5-7,Penny>It's too burnt and frozen at the same time."

165
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,120
<5-7,Penny>拜托
<5-7,Penny>Wait, come on,

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,710
<5-7,Penny>还有什么办法能让你春心荡漾的
<5-7,Penny>what else would sweep you off your feet?

167
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,430
<5-8,Raj>我一直有个关于跳舞的幻想
<5-8,Raj>Well, I've always had this fantasy that involves dancing.

168
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,670
<5-8,Raj>我与舞伴之间的
<5-8,Raj>The sexual chemistry

169
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,760
<5-8,Raj>暧昧感觉犹如电光四射
<5-8,Raj>between my partner and me is electric.

170
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,780
<5-8,Raj>老天啊老天
<5-8,Raj>But boy, oh, boy,

171
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,840
<5-8,Raj>我父亲却不赞同这段恋情
<5-8,Raj>does my father not approve

172
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,720
<5-8,Raj>直到他在舞蹈比赛上看到我们热舞一曲
<5-8,Raj>until he sees us in the big dance competition.

173
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,670
<5-9,Penny>拜托  这是电影《辣身舞》的剧情
<5-9,Penny>Okay, that's just the plot for Dirty Dancing.

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,810
<5-9,Penny>你还喜欢什么
<5-9,Penny>What else would you love?

175
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,790
<5-9,Penny>除上被帕特里克·斯威兹举过头顶之外
<5-9,Penny>Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze's head.

177
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,510
<5-10,Raj>对了  你可以站在他的窗户外
<5-10,Raj>Oh! Oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window

178
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,220
<5-10,Raj>将手提音响高高地举起放歌
<5-10,Raj>with a boom box in the air.

179
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,700
<5-11,Penny>这是电影《情到深处》的桥段
<5-11,Penny>That's from Say Anything.

180
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,540
<5-12,Raj>我是一个深闺寂寞的男人  没事就爱看电影
<5-12,Raj>Look, I'm a lonely guy; I watch a lot of movies.

181
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,160
<5-12,Raj>佩妮  如果你真的想要浪漫
<5-12,Raj>Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic,

182
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,610
<5-12,Raj>就得发自内心
<5-12,Raj>it needs to come from you.

183
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,180
<5-13,Penny>我明白  可为什么这么难呢
<5-13,Penny>I get that, but why is this so hard?

184
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,220
<5-14,Raj>可能是因为你从来不用做这些事
<5-14,Raj>Well, you've probably never had to do this stuff

185
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,160
<5-14,Raj>因为你既年轻又漂亮
<5-14,Raj>'cause you're young and beautiful

186
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,700
<5-14,Raj>男人对你趋之若鹜
<5-14,Raj>and men have always thrown themselves at you.

187
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,680
<5-15,Penny>是啊  我想为此难过一下
<5-15,Penny>Yeah, I'm trying to be sad about that.

188
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,270
<5-15,Penny>但我做不到
<5-15,Penny>I can't.

189
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,690
<6-1,Sheldon>我想想  下个是什么
<6-1,Sheldon>Let's see, what's next?

190
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,740
<6-1,Sheldon>好的  这个
<6-1,Sheldon>Okay! Here.

191
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,520
<6-1,Sheldon>这只马克笔
<6-1,Sheldon>This is the Magic Marker

192
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,790
<6-1,Sheldon>是我做出发现时使用的
<6-1,Sheldon>I was using when I made the discovery.

193
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,230
<6-2,Amy>我不觉得美国博物馆会要你的马克笔
<6-2,Amy>I don't think the Smithsonian's gonna want your marker.

194
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,140
<6-3,Sheldon>这就是我树屋不欢迎你的原因
<6-3,Sheldon>And that's why you're not on a list for my tree fort.

195
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,320
<6-3,Sheldon>猜猜《今日物理》
<6-3,Sheldon>Ooh, guess who's getting an article

196
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,370
<6-3,Sheldon>将写篇关于谁的报导
<6-3,Sheldon>written about him in Physics Today?

197
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,600
<6-3,Sheldon>给你个提示
<6-3,Sheldon>I'll give you a hint.

198
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,200
<6-3,Sheldon>你昨天为他测量过一颗可疑痣的直径
<6-3,Sheldon>You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.

199
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,640
<6-4,Amy>谢尔顿  我真为你骄傲
<6-4,Amy>Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.

200
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,540
<6-5,Sheldon>这是应该的
<6-5,Sheldon>Well, you should be.

201
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,650
<6-5,Sheldon>我的发现的散播速度犹如星火燎原
<6-5,Sheldon>My discovery is spreading like wildfire.

202
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,870
<6-5,Sheldon>和我的痣不同  这颗痣保持稳定
<6-5,Sheldon>Unlike my mole, which is holding steady

203
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,770
<6-5,Sheldon>一直保持菜豆的大小
<6-5,Sheldon>at the size of a navy bean.

204
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,200
<6-6,Amy>下一个是什么
<6-6,Amy>What's next?

205
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,370
<6-7,Sheldon>这本是
<6-7,Sheldon>This is the very copy

206
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,550
<6-7,Sheldon>《化学物理手册》
<6-7,Sheldon>of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics

207
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,290
<6-7,Sheldon>我就是用这本查询了
<6-7,Sheldon>in which I looked up the reaction rates

208
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,390
<6-7,Sheldon>钔的反应速率以及...
<6-7,Sheldon>of mendelevium and...

209
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,360
<6-8,Amy>-以及什么  -完了
<6-8,Amy>- And what? - No.

210
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,640
<6-9,Sheldon>完了  完了  完了
<6-9,Sheldon>No, no, no, no.

211
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,720
<6-10,Amy>出什么事了
<6-10,Amy>What's wrong?

212
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,940
<6-11,Sheldon>我犯了个可怕的错误
<6-11,Sheldon>I've made a horrible mistake.

213
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,280
<6-12,Amy>你在说什么
<6-12,Amy>What are you talking about?

214
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,050
<6-13,Sheldon>这个表格是平方厘米制的
<6-13,Sheldon>This table-- it's in square centimeters.

215
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,810
<6-13,Sheldon>我看成了平方米
<6-13,Sheldon>I read it as square meters.

216
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,320
<6-13,Sheldon>知道这意味着什么吗
<6-13,Sheldon>You know what that means?

217
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,320
<6-14,Amy>美国人看不懂公制吗
<6-14,Amy>That Americans can't handle the metric system?

218
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,650
<6-15,Sheldon>艾米  我这是失之毫厘差之千里的错误
<6-15,Sheldon>Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

219
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,030
<6-16,Amy>但是中国研究小组发现了元素
<6-16,Amy>But the Chinese team found the element.

220
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,150
<6-17,Sheldon>他们不应该发现的
<6-17,Sheldon>Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

221
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,930
<6-17,Sheldon>我的计算是错的
<6-17,Sheldon>My calculations were wrong.

222
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,890
<6-17,Sheldon>元素之间肯定有
<6-17,Sheldon>There must be some resonance

223
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,120
<6-17,Sheldon>我不知道的某种共振
<6-17,Sheldon>between the elements I didn't know about.

224
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,710
<6-18,Amy>这么说你只是幸运吗
<6-18,Amy>So you just got lucky?

225
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,850
<6-19,Sheldon>谢尔顿·库珀从来不靠幸运[没上过床]
<6-19,Sheldon>Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky!

226
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,300
<6-20,Amy>咱们同病相怜  小哥哥
<6-20,Amy>You and me both, brother.

227
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,560
<6-20,Amy>这不重要
<6-20,Amy>It doesn't matter.

228
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,180
<6-20,Amy>因为你元素才会被发现
<6-20,Amy>The element was found because of you,

229
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,570
<6-20,Amy>这是突破性的成果
<6-20,Amy>and that's groundbreaking.

230
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,950
<6-21,Sheldon>重要的是
<6-21,Sheldon>What matters is

231
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,960
<6-21,Sheldon>我这辈子最伟大的科学成就
<6-21,Sheldon>the greatest scientific achievement of my life

232
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,590
<6-21,Sheldon>是建立在一个巨大的错误之上
<6-21,Sheldon>is based on a blunder.

233
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,940
<6-21,Sheldon>我不是天才  我是个骗子
<6-21,Sheldon>I'm not a genius, I'm a fraud.

234
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,080
<6-22,Amy>谢尔顿  在神经系统学里
<6-22,Amy>You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

235
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,300
<6-22,Amy>我们总是在大脑某处有所发现
<6-22,Amy>we're forever finding something in one part of the brain

236
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,950
<6-22,Amy>但地方和原来想的完全不一样
<6-22,Amy>that we thought was someplace else.

237
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,870
<6-23,Sheldon>这下可好
<6-23,Sheldon>Oh, great.

238
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,100
<6-23,Sheldon>现在我连骗子都不如了
<6-23,Sheldon>Now I'm worse than a fraud.

239
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,240
<6-23,Sheldon>我沦为生物学家之流了
<6-23,Sheldon>I'm practically a biologist.

240
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,280
<7-1,Leonard>你别再为这件事自责了
<7-1,Leonard>You got to stop beating yourself up over this.

241
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,950
<7-1,Leonard>你虽然犯了错误  但也是个值得开心的错误
<7-1,Leonard>I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.

242
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,890
<7-2,Sheldon>没什么好值得开心的
<7-2,Sheldon>There's nothing happy about it.

243
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,510
<7-2,Sheldon>这份功劳不是我应得的
<7-2,Sheldon>I'm being given credit that I don't deserve.

244
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,560
<7-3,Leonard>人们经常会得到自己不应得的东西
<7-3,Leonard>Oh, people get things they don't deserve all the time.

245
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,020
<7-3,Leonard>看我的朋友是你就知道了
<7-3,Leonard>Look at me with you.

246
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,020
<7-4,Sheldon>莱纳德  这件事会让我余生都痛苦不堪
<7-4,Sheldon>No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life.

247
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,710
<7-4,Sheldon>每一个科学教室
<7-4,Sheldon>Every science classroom,

248
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,540
<7-4,Sheldon>每一张元素周期表  每一本教科书
<7-4,Sheldon>every periodic table, every textbook--

249
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,480
<7-4,Sheldon>这个错误会恶狠狠地瞪着我
<7-4,Sheldon>this mistake will be staring back at me

250
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,250
<7-4,Sheldon>就像那次你让库萨帕里帮你修眉毛的后果一样
<7-4,Sheldon>like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows.

251
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,520
<7-4,Sheldon>我要想办法解决这件事
<7-4,Sheldon>I've got to find a way to stop this thing.

252
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,970
<7-5,Leonard>伙计  我觉得你没辙
<7-5,Leonard>Buddy, I don't think you can.

253
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,360
<7-5,Leonard>我的意思是  木已成舟  实难挽回
<7-5,Leonard>I mean, once it's out there, it's out there.

254
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,960
<7-5,Leonard>这件事就好比科学界的性爱影片流出
<7-5,Leonard>This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.

255
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,000
<7-6,Sheldon>老实说  我宁愿我的错是性爱影片
<7-6,Sheldon>You know, frankly, I'd prefer a sex tape.

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,700
<7-7,Leonard>你不知道性爱影片是什么吧
<7-7,Leonard>You don't know what a sex tape is, do you?

257
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,860
<7-7,Leonard>不知道
<7-7,Leonard>No.

258
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,250
<8-1,Howard>你们一定要在8点准时到达餐厅
<8-1,Howard>Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by 8:00.

259
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,820
<8-1,Howard>伯纳黛特会在8点半到达
<8-1,Howard>Bernadette's meeting me there at 8:30

260
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,120
<8-1,Howard>我可不想搞砸这次惊喜
<8-1,Howard>and I don't want to blow the surprise.

261
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
<8-2,Leonard>-我们会准时到的  -收到
<8-2,Leonard>- We'll be there. - Got it.

262
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,410
<8-3,Raj>对于这首歌  我有个问题
<8-3,Raj>Now, uh, I have a question about the song.

263
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,790
<8-3,Raj>我一直在想能不能
<8-3,Raj>I was thinking at some point

264
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,150
<8-3,Raj>在歌的某处给你加点说唱饶舌风
<8-3,Raj>I could bust out a little rap.

265
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,690
<8-4,Howard>嘿  哟  不  不  不要
<8-4,Howard>N-N-N-No...

266
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,810
<8-5,Raj>干嘛这样  你都还没听呢
<8-5,Raj>Come on, come on, you haven't even heard it yet.

267
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,810
<8-5,Raj>莱纳德  来点拍子
<8-5,Raj>Leonard, give me a beat.

268
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,820
<8-6,Leonard>不要
<8-6,Leonard>I will not.

269
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,810
<8-7,Raj>拜托啦
<8-7,Raj>Please?

270
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,530
<8-8,Howard>不要  我要的是浪漫好吗
<8-8,Howard>No, I want this to be romantic.

271
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,450
<8-9,Raj>会很浪漫啊
<8-9,Raj>It will be!

272
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,180
<8-9,Raj>歌词里没有叫任何人"婊子"
<8-9,Raj>I don't call anyone a ho,

273
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,260
<8-9,Raj>而且我唯一用到"我的小贱人"这个词
<8-9,Raj>and the only time I use the phrase "my bitch,"

274
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,310
<8-9,Raj>指的还是你
<8-9,Raj>I'm referring to you.

275
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,090
<8-10,Voice>他来了
<8-10,Voice>There he is!

276
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,050
<8-11,Sheldon>停下
<8-11,Sheldon>Stop it.

277
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,900
<8-11,Sheldon>别鼓掌赞扬我
<8-11,Sheldon>Stop celebrating me!

278
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,570
<8-13,Sheldon>还有无欢呼
<8-13,Sheldon>And no woos!

279
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,050
<8-13,Sheldon>不是说你  吴[无]博士  跟你没关系
<8-13,Sheldon>Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You're fine.

280
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,920
<8-13,Sheldon>我想让大家知道
<8-13,Sheldon>I want you all to know

281
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,240
<8-13,Sheldon>你们没必要为我鼓掌喝彩
<8-13,Sheldon>that you have no reason to applaud me.

282
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,440
<8-13,Sheldon>我所谓的"突破"
<8-13,Sheldon>My so-called breakthrough

283
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,430
<8-13,Sheldon>不是因为我的聪明才智
<8-13,Sheldon>wasn't the result of my genius.

284
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,080
<8-13,Sheldon>那不过是我犯的低级错误而已
<8-13,Sheldon>It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake.

285
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
<8-13,Sheldon>所以以后
<8-13,Sheldon>So please refrain

286
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,000
<8-13,Sheldon>请克制住你们想为此赞扬我的冲动
<8-13,Sheldon>from praising me for it in the future.

287
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,930
<8-14,Raj>什么  我不懂
<8-14,Raj>Wh... I don't understand.

288
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,330
<8-14,Raj>他们没发现那个元素吗
<8-14,Raj>They didn't find the element?

289
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,630
<8-15,Sheldon>不  他们发现了
<8-15,Sheldon>Oh, no, they found the element.

290
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,760
<8-15,Sheldon>不  不  停下
<8-15,Sheldon>No, no, stop it!

291
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,130
<8-15,Sheldon>我不需要你们这样的人
<8-15,Sheldon>I don't need to take this admiration

292
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,930
<8-15,Sheldon>来赞美崇拜我
<8-15,Sheldon>from the likes of you people!

293
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,000
<8-15,Sheldon>我怎么才能让他们不喜欢我呢
<8-15,Sheldon>How do I make them stop loving me?

294
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,300
<8-16,Leonard>邀请他们跟咱们一起住
<8-16,Leonard>Invite them to live with us.

295
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,410
<9-1,Penny>-伯纳黛特一定会感动死的  -对啊
<9-1,Penny>- Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this. - Yeah.

296
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,800
<9-2,Leonard>有人为自己做这么浪漫的事  感觉一定很棒
<9-2,Leonard>It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.

297
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,180
<9-3,Penny>够了  你知道什么是不浪漫吗
<9-3,Penny>Okay, you know what's not romantic?

298
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,850
<9-3,Penny>正面嘲讽别人[在别人脸上蹭来蹭去]
<9-3,Penny>Rubbing it in someone's face.

299
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,870
<9-4,Leonard>老实说这的确是
<9-4,Leonard>Actually, it can be,

300
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,620
<9-4,Leonard>但我之前说了  床事不算
<9-4,Leonard>but I told you sex doesn't count.

301
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,300
<9-5,Howard>我开始担心伯纳黛特了
<9-5,Howard>I'm getting worried about Bernadette.

302
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,670
<9-5,Howard>我要打给她问一下
<9-5,Howard>I'm gonna call and check on her.

303
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,680
<9-6,Sheldon>国家科学基金会
<9-6,Sheldon>The National Science Foundation

304
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,670
<9-6,Sheldon>想给我一大笔研究基金
<9-6,Sheldon>wants to give me a substantial grant.

305
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,890
<9-7,Raj>-这是大事啊  -我知道
<9-7,Raj>- Oh, that's a big deal. - I know.

306
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,120
<9-8,Sheldon>这场恶梦要何时才能结束
<9-8,Sheldon>When will this nightmare end?

307
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,030
<9-9,Leonard>我知道你觉得受不起这些关注
<9-9,Leonard>Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention,

308
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,940
<9-9,Leonard>但你做的事真的很了不起
<9-9,Leonard>but still, what you did is amazing.

309
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,690
<9-9,Leonard>-我们为你感到骄傲  -除了我
<9-9,Leonard>- We're really proud of you. - I'm not.

310
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,960
<9-10,Amy>你不是吗
<9-10,Amy>You're not?

311
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,180
<9-12,Amy>谢尔顿  我一直在考虑这件事
<9-12,Amy>Sheldon, I've been thinking about it,

312
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,650
<9-12,Amy>你说得对
<9-12,Amy>and you're right.

313
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,630
<9-12,Amy>这份功劳不是你应得的
<9-12,Amy>You don't deserve any credit.

314
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,440
<9-12,Amy>你不过是看错了表上一些数字
<9-12,Amy>All you did was misread some numbers on a table.

315
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,410
<9-12,Amy>那还是一张非常简单的表
<9-12,Amy>A very easy table, too.

316
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,340
<9-12,Amy>老实说  我为你感到羞愧
<9-12,Amy>Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you.

317
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,780
<9-13,Sheldon>这是我这辈子听过最浪漫的话了
<9-13,Sheldon>That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

318
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,710
<9-14,Penny>靠  大家都比我会耍浪漫
<9-14,Penny>Damn it, everyone's better at this than me.

<9-15,Sheldon>恭喜你  福勒博士
<9-15,Sheldon>Congratulations, Dr. Fowler.

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,460
<9-16,Howard>各位  妮妮的实验室出事了
<9-16,Howard>Guys, there w-was an accident at Bernie's lab.

00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,660
<9-17,Leonard>天啊  她没事吧
<9-17,Leonard>Oh, my God, is she okay?

323
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,190
<9-18,Howard>没事  不过她被送去医院隔离了
<9-18,Howard>Yeah, but she's at the hospital in quarantine.

324
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,000
<9-20,Amy>-什么  -可怜的伯纳黛特
<9-20,Amy>- What? - Poor Bernadette.

325
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,140
<9-22,Sheldon>我不想雪上加霜  但我刚获得加薪了
<9-22,Sheldon>I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.

326
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,430
<10-1,Howard>天啊  妮妮  发生什么事了
<10-1,Howard>Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?

<10-2,Bernadette>我只能说下次当你把
<10-2,Bernadette>Well, let's just say the next time you move

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,190
<10-3,Howard>你确定你没事吗

331
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,660
<10-4,Bernadette>没事  这只是防范措施而已
<10-4,Bernadette>Yeah, it's just a precaution.

332
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,340
<10-4,Bernadette>如果我有事
<10-4,Bernadette>If there was a problem,

409
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,420
<11-2,Penny>叫"调味包"
<11-2,Penny>the flavor packet.

410
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,610
<11-2,Penny>那包玩意还真不是浪得虚名
<11-2,Penny>That sucker is well named.

<11-4,Penny>Oh, I am.

417
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,110
<11-4,Penny>如果你沿着这花径走
<11-4,Penny>Maybe if you follow this trail,

418
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,900
<11-4,Penny>或许就能知道原因
<11-4,Penny>you'll see why.

419

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,910
<11-15,Leonard>是我们一起在二手书店
<11-15,Leonard>when we were at the used bookstore together

441
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,900
<11-15,Leonard>我买下第一版的这书时说的
<11-15,Leonard>and I saw the first edition and I bought it.

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,520
<11-18,Penny>你所做的一切才是最贴心的
<11-18,Penny>What's thoughtful is everything you do.

<11-18,Penny>这里  你看这些
<11-18,Penny>Here, you know what? Look at this.

448
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,330
<11-18,Penny>当时我假期没钱买机票回老家
<11-18,Penny>when I was too poor to go home for the holidays.

449
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,250
<11-18,Penny>这是你放在我挡风玻璃上的玫瑰花
<11-18,Penny>And the rose you left on my windshield...

450
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,090
<11-18,Penny>就耍耍浪漫
<11-18,Penny>just because.

451
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,440
<11-18,Penny>这是你在我们第一次做爱后隔天
<11-18,Penny>Here's the-the thank-you letter you wrote me

452
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,400
<11-18,Penny>你写给我的感谢信
<11-18,Penny>after the first time I slept with you.

457
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,580
<11-21,Leonard>过来

458
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,160
<11-23,Leonard>那是验孕棒吗
<11-23,Leonard>Is that a pregnancy test?

459
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,110
<11-24,Penny>就留了第一根
<11-24,Penny>Oh, yeah, just the first one.

460
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,000
<11-24,Penny>我当然不会全留下
<11-24,Penny>I didn't save them all.

461
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,830
<12-1,Sheldon>真不敢相信我看错了这表格
<12-1,Sheldon>I can't believe I read this table wrong.

462
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,620
<12-1,Sheldon>都怪你
<12-1,Sheldon>I blame you.

463
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,030
<12-2,Amy>我  关我什么事
<12-2,Amy>Me? What did I do?

464
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,520
<12-3,Sheldon>你害我分心
<12-3,Sheldon>You distract me.

465
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,430
<12-3,Sheldon>从遇见你的那一刻  你就让我分心
<12-3,Sheldon>I've been distracted since the moment I met you.

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,920
<12-4,Amy>对不起嘛

467
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,430
<12-4,Amy>没错
<12-4,Amy>Well, you should be.

468
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,610
<12-5,Sheldon>因为我脑海里
<12-5,Sheldon>Because all I can think about

469
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,990
<12-5,Sheldon>满满得都是想吻你的冲动
<12-5,Sheldon>is how much I want to kiss you.

470
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,540
<12-5,Sheldon>而且不是吻脸颊  是要吻嘴唇
<12-5,Sheldon>And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth.

471
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,840
<12-5,Sheldon>像所有爸爸妈妈做的那样
<12-5,Sheldon>Like mommies and daddies do.
