1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,920
<1-1,Howard>看看这个  简直太酷了
<1-1,Howard>Watch this, it's really cool.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,030
<1-1,Howard>呼叫里奥纳德·霍夫斯塔德
<1-1,Howard>Call leonard hofstadter.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,730
<1-2,Howard’s phone>是否呼叫海伦·博克斯莱特纳?
<1-2,Howard’s phone>Did you say "call hellen boxlightner?"

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,680
<1-3,Howard>不  呼叫里奥纳德·霍夫斯塔德
<1-3,Howard>No. Call leonard hofstadter.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,930
<1-4,Howard’s phone>是否呼叫坦布尔·巴德塞德?
<1-4,Howard’s phone>Did you say "call temple badsaidor?"

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,800
<1-2,Howard’s phone>-不是!  -让我来试试
<1-2,Howard’s phone>No!  Let me try!

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,450
<1-3,Howard>呼叫...
<1-3,Howard>Call...

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,380
<1-6,Leonard>麦克夫罗诺·麦克夫鲁尼路
<1-6,Leonard>McFlono McFlooniloo

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,100
<1-7,Howard’s phone>正在呼叫拉杰·库萨帕里
<1-7,Howard’s phone>Calling "rajesh koothrappali."

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,040
<1-8,Raj>真不赖啊
<1-8,Raj>That's very impressive.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,510
<1-8,Raj>不过有点种族歧视
<1-8,Raj>And a little racist.

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,410
<1-9,Sheldon>如果大家玩够了"来嘲笑有缺陷的科技"
<1-9,Sheldon>If we're all through playing "mock the flawed technology,"

13
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,900
<1-9,Sheldon>是不是可以开始"光晕之夜"(游戏名)了
<1-9,Sheldon>Can we get on with halo night?

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,370
<1-9,Sheldon>本该8点就开始的  现在已经8:06了
<1-9,Sheldon>We were supposed to start at 8:00. it is now 8:06.

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,180
<1-10,Leonard>那现在开始吧
<1-10,Leonard>So we'll start now.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,760
<1-11,Sheldon>首先我们得考虑下这已过去的六分钟要算在什么地方
<1-11,Sheldon>First we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,090
<1-11,Sheldon>是游戏时间  上厕所时间还是休息吃披萨的时间
<1-11,Sheldon>Out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,940
<1-12,Raj>就各算两分钟吧
<1-12,Raj>We could split it two, two and two.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,870
<1-13,Howard>如果我们披萨吃的是沙丁鱼
<1-13,Howard>If we're having anchovies on the pizza,

20
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,510
<1-13,Howard>那从上厕所时间里拿掉两分钟恐怕不行
<1-13,Howard>We can't take it out of bathroom time.

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,160
<1-14,Sheldon>又见什么新鲜鬼了
<1-14,Sheldon>Oh, what fresh hell is this?

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,670
<1-15,Leonard (opening door)>-潘妮啊  进来吧  -大家好
<1-15,Leonard (opening door)>-hey, penny. come on in. -hey, guys.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,360
<1-16,Penny>见到一分钱(潘妮的名字意为一分钱)  捡起来(暗指约会)
<1-16,Penny>See a penny, pick her up,

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,630
<1-17,Howard>一整天你都会交上好运
<1-17,Howard>And all the day you'll have good luck.

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,690
<1-18,Penny>不  你不会的
<1-18,Penny>No, you won't.

26
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,190
<1-18,Penny>我能在这里躲一会吗
<1-18,Penny>Can I hide out here for a while?

27
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,790
<1-19,Leonard>当然可以  发生什么事了
<1-19,Leonard>Sure. what's going on?

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,430
<1-20,Penny>我在内布拉斯加州时有认识个女孩  叫克里斯蒂
<1-20,Penny>There's this girl I know from back in nebraska, christy.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,980
<1-20,Penny>她打电话给我  说什么"好啊  加利福尼亚怎么样啊"
<1-20,Penny>She called me up, and she's like, "hey, how's california?"

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,380
<1-20,Penny>我就说"棒极了"  毕竟你知道  这里不是什么内布拉斯加
<1-20,Penny>And I'm like, "awesome," cause, you know, it's not nebraska.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,820
<1-20,Penny>接下去我就发现
<1-20,Penny>And the next thing I know

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,090
<1-20,Penny>她已经自说自话过来要跟我住一起
<1-20,Penny>She's invited herself out here to stay with me.

33
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,420
<1-21,Sheldon>8:08了
<1-21,Sheldon>8:08.

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,430
<1-22,Penny>反正  她今天已经到了这儿  刚才还在我房间里
<1-22,Penny>Anyway, she got here today and she's just been in my apartment

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,750
<1-22,Penny>说她在奥马哈上过的一个又一个的男人是怎么怎么爽法
<1-22,Penny>Yakity yakking about every guy she slept with in omaha,

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,530
<1-22,Penny>基本上就是奥马哈所有的男人了
<1-22,Penny>Which is basically every guy in omaha,

37
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,250
<1-22,Penny>还在那洗她的内衣裤
<1-22,Penny>And washing the sluttiest

38
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,200
<1-22,Penny>肯定是你在我浴室洗水槽里见过的最淫荡的了
<1-22,Penny>Collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.

39
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,070
<1-23,Howard>她是每次洗一条丁字裤还是扔一大堆进去的...
<1-23,Howard>Is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she throw it all in...

40
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,350
<1-23,Howard>...好像浓味性爱鱼羹一样?
<1-23,Howard>...like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

41
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,630
<1-24,Penny>-真的有必要把他的筋给搭回来  -没错
<1-24,Penny>-he really needs to dial it down. -i know.

42
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,110
<1-25,Leonard>可你既然不喜欢这个叫克里斯蒂的  为什么要留她住呢?
<1-25,Leonard>So if you don't like this christy, why are you letting her stay?

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,730
<1-26,Penny>她和我表兄订过婚
<1-26,Penny>She was engaged to my cousin

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,640
<1-26,Penny>在那同时又和我亲兄睡过觉  所以她算是我亲人吧
<1-26,Penny>While she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,410
<1-27,Sheldon>我为我刚才的爆发道歉
<1-27,Sheldon>I apologize for my earlier outburst.

46
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,330
<1-27,Sheldon>谁还需要玩光晕呢  因为我们已经
<1-27,Sheldon>Who needs halo, when we can be regaled

47
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,130
<1-27,Sheldon>愉快并无上光荣地聆听到了奥马哈的娼妓传说
<1-27,Sheldon>With the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha?

48
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,720
<1-28,Leonard>我觉得她不会是妓女的
<1-28,Leonard>I don't think she's a whore.

49
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,780
<1-29,Penny>不  没错  她绝对就是个妓女
<1-29,Penny>No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.

50
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,300
<1-29,Penny>她完全没有自己的原则
<1-29,Penny>I mean, she has absolutely no standards.

51
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,570
<1-29,Penny>某一次她在...
<1-29,Penny>This one time she was at...

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,120
<1-29,Penny>霍华德人呢?
<1-29,Penny>Where's howard?

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,050
<1-30,Howard (voice off)>你好  小姐  我知道你刚来这里
<1-30,Howard (voice off)>Bonjour, mademoiselle. I understand you're new in town.

54
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,020
<1-31,Sheldon>上帝
<1-31,Sheldon>Oh, good grief.

60
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,250
<2-1,Penny>难以置信克里斯蒂竟然让霍华德进了我的房间
<2-1,Penny>I cannot believe christy let howard into my apartment.

61
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,270
<2-2,Sheldon>难以置信人们会花钱去算命
<2-2,Sheldon>And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes,

62
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,700
<2-2,Sheldon>不过更值得提醒的是
<2-2,Sheldon>But on a more serious note,

63
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,090
<2-2,Sheldon>现在已经8:13了  而我们还没有开始玩光晕
<2-2,Sheldon>It's 8:13 and we're still not playing halo.

64
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,000
<2-3,Leonard>好吧  我们就玩一对一  直到他回来
<2-3,Leonard>Fine. we'll just play one-on-one until he gets back.

65
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,200
<2-4,Sheldon>一对一?  我们从来不玩一对一  我们都是组队比赛  不玩一对一
<2-4,Sheldon>One-on-one? we don't play one-on-one. we play teams, not one-on-one.

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,500
<2-4,Sheldon>一对一
<2-4,Sheldon>One-on-one.

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,530
<2-5,Leonard>现在我们要玩组队对抗的唯一办法是把拉杰砍成两半
<2-5,Leonard>The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half.

68
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,450
<2-6,Raj>是啊  把这外国人砍成两半
<2-6,Raj>Sure, cut the foreigner in half.

69
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,990
<2-6,Raj>他的国家还有十几亿人呢
<2-6,Raj>There's a billion more where he came from.

70
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,250
<2-7,Penny>如果你们还差一个  那我来吧
<2-7,Penny>If you guys need a fourth, I'll play.

71
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,890
<2-8,Leonard>-好主意  -不
<2-8,Leonard>-great idea. -no.

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,810
<2-9,Sheldon>轮子的发明是个好主意
<2-9,Sheldon>The wheel was a great idea,

73
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,460
<2-9,Sheldon>相对论是个好主意
<2-9,Sheldon>Relativity was a great idea.

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,030
<2-9,Sheldon>这只能算是个想法  还是很烂的一个
<2-9,Sheldon>This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,030
<2-10,Penny>为什么
<2-10,Penny>Why?

76
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,990
<2-10,Penny>为什么?
<2-10,Penny>Why?

77
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,510
<2-11,Sheldon>潘妮  潘妮  潘妮
<2-11,Sheldon>Oh, penny, penny, penny.

78
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,030
<2-12,Penny>说吧  说吧  说吧
<2-12,Penny>What, what, what?

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,100
<2-13,Sheldon>这是个复杂的模拟对战游戏  需要琢磨很长时间
<2-13,Sheldon>This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve.

80
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,860
<2-13,Sheldon>有近似无数种武器  交通工具和攻略需要掌握
<2-13,Sheldon>There are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies

81
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,410
<2-13,Sheldon>更不用说那错综复杂的故事背景了
<2-13,Sheldon>To master, not to mention an extremely intricate backstory.

82
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,710
<2-14,Penny (picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television)>酷  看我爆了谁的头
<2-14,Penny (picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television)>Oh cool. whose head did I just blow off?

83
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,110
<2-15,Sheldon>我的
<2-15,Sheldon>Mine.

84
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,830
<2-16,Penny>好了  我已经明白了  各就各位吧  伙计们
<2-16,Penny>Okay, I got this. lock and load, boys.

85
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,990
<2-17,Leonard>这是我们能玩组队对抗的唯一办法
<2-17,Leonard>It's the only way we can play teams.

86
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,230
<2-18,Sheldon>是  可无论谁做她队友都会被害惨
<2-18,Sheldon>Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung

87
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,600
<2-18,Sheldon>她缺乏作战经验  更别提她...
<2-18,Sheldon>By her lack of experience, and not to mention the fact...

88
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,690
<2-19,Penny>你的头又爆了哈
<2-19,Penny>There goes your head again.

89
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,260
<2-20,Sheldon>好吧  在别人刚复活的时候就向他射击是很没体育道德的
<2-20,Sheldon>Ok.It's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.

90
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,600
<2-20,Sheldon>你得给他们机会来...不会吧
<2-20,Sheldon>You need to to give them a chance to... now, come on!

91
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,340
<2-21,Sheldon>拉杰  拉杰!  她把我逼到角落了  过来掩护我!
<2-21,Sheldon>Raj, raj! she's got me cornered. cover me!

92
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,090
<2-22,Penny>掩护你这个  无能!
<2-22,Penny>Cover this, suckers!

93
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,370
<2-23,Leonard>-潘妮  你火力全开啊(直译:身上着火)  -没错  谢尔顿也是
<2-23,Leonard>-penny, you are on fire! -yes, and so is sheldon.

94
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,130
<2-24,Penny>好了  就这样吧  我知道她怎样办到的  但她肯定作弊了
<2-24,Penny>Okay, that's it. I don't know how, but she is cheating.

95
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,240
<2-25,Sheldon>没人能长那么漂亮  游戏还玩得这么好
<2-25,Sheldon>No one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game.

96
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,180
<2-26,Penny>等等  谢尔顿  回来  有件东西你忘了
<2-26,Penny>Wait, sheldon, come back. you forgot something.

97
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,560
<2-27,Sheldon>什么?
<2-27,Sheldon>What?

98
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,310
<2-28,Penny>这个等离子手榴弹
<2-28,Penny>This plasma grenade.

99
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,230
<2-28,Penny>看  你被炸得满天都是
<2-28,Penny>Look, it's raining you.

100
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,190
<2-29,Sheldon>你笑吧  你等着你需要技术支援的那天吧
<2-29,Sheldon>You laugh now--you just wait until you need tech support.

101
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,920
<2-30,Penny>天啊  他真是输不起啊  是不是?
<2-30,Penny>Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,680
<2-31,Leonard>老实说  他赢的时候也不怎么样
<2-31,Leonard>To be fair, he's also a rather unpleasant winner.

103
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,400
<2-32,Penny>走了  玩得很愉快
<2-32,Penny>Well, it's been fun.

104
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,450
<2-33,Leonard>潘妮  我们的组合很棒啊
<2-33,Leonard>You know Penny. We make such a good team.

105
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,810
<2-33,Leonard>或许我们什么时候可以参加一些光晕锦标赛
<2-33,Leonard>Maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournaments sometime.

106
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,000
<2-34,Penny>或者我们还是过得充实点吧
<2-34,Penny>Or we could just have a life.

107
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,750
<2-35,Leonard>我猜对你来说  这可以是个选择啊
<2-35,Leonard>I guess for you that's an option.

108
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,850
<2-36,Penny>-晚安  里奥纳德  -晚安
<2-36,Penny>-good night Leonard. -good night.

109
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,960
<2-38,Penny>还是那句  和你聊天很愉快  拉杰
<2-38,Penny>As usual, nice talking to you, raj.

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,480
<2-39,Raj>你说她刚那句话是什么意思?
<2-39,Raj>What do you suppose she meant by that?

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,110
<2-40,Leonard>她是个谜一样的人  拉杰
<2-40,Leonard>She's an enigma, raj.

112
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,720
<2-41,Sheldon>还有一件事  潘妮  这个游戏是讲究一定规范和伦理的
<2-41,Sheldon>And another thing--there's a certain ethic to the game, penny,

113
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,730
<2-41,Sheldon>-一个良好...  -她已经走了  谢尔顿
<2-41,Sheldon>-a well-established... -she's gone.

114
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,580
<2-43,Sheldon>她可以说声再见的
<2-43,Sheldon>She could have said good-bye.

115
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,860
<2-44,Penny (entering again)>我遇到麻烦了
<2-44,Penny (entering again)>Okay, I have a problem.

116
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,290
<2-45,Sheldon>那叫做腕管综合症  老实说  你活该
<2-45,Sheldon>It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.

117
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,450
<2-46,Leonard>怎么了?
<2-46,Leonard>What's wrong?

118
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,450
<2-47,Penny>霍华德和克里斯蒂在...
<2-47,Penny>Howard and christy are...

119
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,350
<2-47,Penny>在我卧室里搞上了
<2-47,Penny>Kind of hooking up in my bedroom.

120
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,200
<2-48,Leonard>你肯定?
<2-48,Leonard>Are you sure?

121
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,740
<2-49,Penny>我是在农场里长大的
<2-49,Penny>I grew up on a farm, okay?

122
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,670
<2-49,Penny>从我听到的来看  他们要么是在做爱
<2-49,Penny>From what I heard, they're either having sex

123
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,640
<2-49,Penny>要么就是霍华德被挤奶机给夹住了
<2-49,Penny>Or howard's caught in a milking machine.

124
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,350
<2-49,Penny>如果今晚我睡在这儿你(们)介意吗?
<2-49,Penny>Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

125
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,750
<2-50,Leonard>不会  你可以睡沙发  或者睡我床
<2-50,Leonard>No, take the couch, or my bed.

126
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,380
<2-50,Leonard>我刚买了新枕头  低致敏的
<2-50,Leonard>I just got new pillows. hypo-allergenic.

127
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,770
<2-51,Penny>沙发好了
<2-51,Penny>The couch is good.

128
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,140
<2-52,Sheldon>稍等  里奥纳德  过来下
<2-52,Sheldon>Hold that thought. leonard, a moment.

129
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,230
<2-53,Leonard>我猜着了  你对此有意见
<2-53,Leonard>Let me guess. you have a problem with this.

130
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,920
<2-54,Sheldon>-从哪儿说起呢  -你说吧  你这么做简直疯了
<2-54,Sheldon>-where do I begin? -it's up to you. crazy person's choice.

131
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,750
<2-56,Sheldon>首先  我们不留人过夜的
<2-56,Sheldon>First, we don't have houseguests.

132
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,700
<2-56,Sheldon>说实话  如果我付得起房租  我会请你走的
<2-56,Sheldon>Frankly, if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave.

133
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,320
<2-57,Leonard>你的友情对我来说也很重要  还有什么要说
<2-57,Leonard>Your friendship means a lot to me as well. what else?

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,820
<2-57,Leonard>还有...
<2-57,Leonard>Well...

135
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,890
<2-58,Sheldon>关于我们的地震补给  我们只有两人两天的装备
<2-58,Sheldon>Our earthquake supplies. we have a two-man, two-day kit.

136
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,960
<2-59,Leonard>又怎么说
<2-59,Leonard>So?

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,300
<2-60,Sheldon>因此如果发生了地震  而我们三个人被困在这儿
<2-60,Sheldon>So if there's an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here,

138
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,610
<2-60,Sheldon>到了明天下午我们就会没食物了
<2-60,Sheldon>We could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.

139
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,340
<2-61,Leonard>不好意思  你是在说如果我们让潘妮住这儿
<2-61,Leonard>I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let penny stay

140
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,320
<2-61,Leonard>我们可能会屈服于吃人肉?
<2-61,Leonard>We might succumb to cannibalism?

141
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,290
<2-62,Sheldon>没人会在事情发生之前就知道它会发生
<2-62,Sheldon>No one ever thinks it'll happen until it does.

142
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,570
<2-63,Leonard>潘妮  如果你发誓不会在我们睡着时从我们的骨头上啃肉吃
<2-63,Leonard>Penny, If you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones

143
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,530
<2-63,Leonard>你就可以住在这儿
<2-63,Leonard>While we sleep, you can stay.

144
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,980
<2-65,Sheldon>-什么  -他在运用归谬反证法
<2-65,Sheldon>-what? -he's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

145
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,810
<2-65,Sheldon>就是通过把某方的论点夸大到荒谬的地步
<2-65,Sheldon>It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument

146
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,170
<2-65,Sheldon>然后批判这个它的结果  这是逻辑上的谬误
<2-65,Sheldon>To ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result.

147
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,110
<2-65,Sheldon>我不欣赏这种方法
<2-65,Sheldon>And I do not appreciate it.

148
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,100
<2-66,Leonard>我去帮你拿毯子和枕头
<2-66,Leonard>I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.

149
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,640
<2-67,Sheldon>好吧  既然很明显我被无视了
<2-67,Sheldon>Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored here,

150
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,940
<2-67,Sheldon>让我再说一下这里早晨的安排
<2-67,Sheldon>Let's go over the morning schedule.

151
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,100
<2-67,Sheldon>早上7:00到7:20是我用卫生间的时段
<2-67,Sheldon>I use the bathroom from 7:00 to 7:20.

152
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,650
<2-67,Sheldon>请相应地计划好你的洗漱和生理机能
<2-67,Sheldon>Plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.

153
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,480
<2-68,Penny>请问我该如何计划好我的生理机能?
<2-68,Penny>How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?

154
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,900
<2-69,Sheldon>我建议晚上11点以后不再进水
<2-69,Sheldon>I suggest no liquids after 11:00 p.m.

155
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,210
<2-70,Leonard>-好好睡吧  -谢谢  里奥纳德
<2-70,Leonard>-here you go. -thanks, leonard.

156
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,170
<2-72,Sheldon>错了
<2-72,Sheldon>Wrong.

157
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,750
<2-73,Penny>洗耳恭听
<2-73,Penny>I'm listening.

158
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,710
<2-74,Sheldon>你的头该睡在另一边
<2-74,Sheldon>Your head goes on the other end.

159
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,790
<2-76,Sheldon>-为什么  -这是普遍的文化现象
<2-76,Sheldon>-why? -it's culturally universal. a bed,

160
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,170
<2-76,Sheldon>床  即使是临时的床
<2-76,Sheldon>Even a temporary bed,

161
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,910
<2-76,Sheldon>人们总是会把床头板放在远离门的位置
<2-76,Sheldon>Is always oriented with the headboard away from the door.

162
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,280
<2-76,Sheldon>这是古代人遵循的规则  能保护自己不受野兽袭击
<2-76,Sheldon>It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.

163
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,950
<2-77,Penny>我愿意冒个险
<2-77,Penny>I'll risk it.

164
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,380
<2-79,Penny>还有什么需要说的吗
<2-79,Penny>Anything else should I know?

165
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,280
<2-80,Sheldon>是的  如果你用了我的牙刷
<2-80,Sheldon>Yes, if you use my toothbrush,

166
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,050
<2-80,Sheldon>我会从那窗户跳下去
<2-80,Sheldon>I'll jump out that window.

167
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,520
<2-80,Sheldon>请你不必参加我的葬礼  祝你晚安
<2-80,Sheldon>Please don't come to my funeral. have a good night.

168
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,380
<2-81,Leonard>真抱歉
<2-81,Leonard>Sorry about that.

169
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,260
<2-83,Leonard>-没有关系  -消息提醒
<2-83,Leonard>-that's okay. -fyi--

170
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,900
<2-83,Leonard>他的牙刷是红色的那个  放在树脂玻璃杯里在紫外线下消毒
<2-83,Leonard>His toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglas case under the uv light.

171
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,580
<2-84,Penny>知道了
<2-84,Penny>Got it.

172
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,470
<2-85,Leonard>-睡得塌实  -谢谢
<2-85,Leonard>-sleep tight. -thanks

173
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,350
<2-87,Leonard>"睡得塌实"这个说法其实很有意思
<2-87,Leonard>Funny expression, "sleep tight."

174
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,030
<2-87,Leonard>这源自于床最早出现时的构造
<2-87,Leonard>It refers to the early construction of beds

175
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,530
<2-87,Leonard>就是把绳子互相系紧了悬挂起来  在上面放个床垫
<2-87,Leonard>Which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes,

176
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,270
<2-87,Leonard>所以偶尔...
<2-87,Leonard>Which would occasionally...

177
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,600
<2-85,Leonard>睡得塌实
<2-85,Leonard>Sleep tight.

178
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,060
<3-1,Leonard>你在干吗
<3-1,Leonard>What are you doing?

179
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,580
<3-4,Sheldon>自从我们住进这里  每个星期六
<3-4,Sheldon>Every saturday since we've lived in this apartment

180
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,110
<3-4,Sheldon>我都是6:15醒来  为自己倒一碗麦片
<3-4,Sheldon>I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal,

181
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,000
<3-2,Sheldon>在里面加四分之一杯2%脂的牛奶
<3-2,Sheldon>Added a quarter cup of two percent milk,

182
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,920
<3-2,Sheldon>坐在这张沙发的这一头  调到BBC美国频道
<3-2,Sheldon>Sat on this end of this couch, turned on bbc america,

183
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,650
<3-2,Sheldon>收看"神秘博士"(英国著名科幻剧)
<3-2,Sheldon>And watched doctor who.

184
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,220
<3-3,Leonard>潘妮还在睡呢
<3-3,Leonard>Penny's still sleeping.

185
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,490
<3-4,Sheldon>自从我们住进这里  每个星期六
<3-4,Sheldon>Every saturday since we've lived in this apartment

186
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,820
<3-4,Sheldon>我都是6:15醒来  为自己倒一碗麦片
<3-4,Sheldon>I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl

187
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,350
<3-5,Leonard>我知道了  你自己房间里有电视啊
<3-5,Leonard>I know. you have a tv in your room.

188
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,450
<3-5,Leonard>你为什么就不能在床上吃早餐呢
<3-5,Leonard>Why don't you just have breakfast in bed?

189
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,120
<3-6,Sheldon>因为我既没有生病伤残  也不是一个庆祝母亲节的女人
<3-6,Sheldon>Because I am neither an invalid, nor a woman celebrating mother's day.

190
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,480
<3-7,Penny>几点了?
<3-7,Penny>What time is it?

191
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,160
<3-8,Leonard>6:30左右
<3-8,Leonard>Almost 6:30.

192
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,800
<3-9,Penny>我睡了整整一天?
<3-9,Penny>I slept all day?

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,890
<3-10,Leonard>不  是早晨6:30
<3-10,Leonard>No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

194
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,710
<3-11,Penny>你们到底有什么毛病?
<3-11,Penny>What the hell is your problem?

195
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,730
<3-12,Sheldon>好了  这碗麦片已经丧失其所有分子完整性
<3-12,Sheldon>Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity.

196
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,750
<3-12,Sheldon>现在我碗里的是一团团麦片糨糊
<3-12,Sheldon>I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.

197
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,230
<3-13,Howard (entering)>好  小怪物们
<3-13,Howard (entering)>Hola, nerd-migos.

198
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,980
<3-14,Penny>你们这群人为什么会讨厌睡觉呢
<3-14,Penny>Why do you people hate sleep?

199
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,980
<3-14,Penny>你穿的是我的浴袍吗
<3-14,Penny>Are you wearing my robe?

200
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,440
<3-15,Howard>是的  抱歉  我会洗干净的
<3-15,Howard>Yeah. sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

201
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,450
<3-16,Penny>没关系  你留着吧
<3-16,Penny>That's okay, keep it.

202
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,930
<3-17,Howard>-克里斯蒂呢?  -在洗澡
<3-17,Howard>-where's christy? -in the shower.

203
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,480
<3-17,Howard>对了  你哪儿买的丝瓜络手套
<3-17,Howard>By the way, where did you get that loofah mitt?

204
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,250
<3-17,Howard>你的能够到一些我的碰不到的地方
<3-17,Howard>Yours reaches places that mine just won't.

205
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,580
<3-18,Penny>你用了我的丝瓜络?
<3-18,Penny>You used my loofah?

206
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,460
<3-19,Howard>更准确地说  是我们用了你的丝瓜络
<3-19,Howard>More precisely, we used your loofah.

207
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,680
<3-19,Howard>我把她头上死皮都去干净了
<3-19,Howard>I exfoliated her brains out.

208
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,960
<3-20,Penny>那个你也留着吧
<3-20,Penny>You can keep that, too.

209
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,810
<3-21,Howard>那看来我们得谈谈你的那些绒毛熊
<3-21,Howard>Then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.

210
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,040
<3-22,Christie (voice off)>霍华德
<3-22,Christie (voice off)>Howard!

211
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,530
<3-23,Howard>在这儿  夫人
<3-23,Howard>In here, milady!

212
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,190
<3-24,Christie (entering)>我的小引擎在这儿啊
<3-24,Christie (entering)>Here's my little engine that could.

213
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,700
<3-26,Sheldon>我有本心爱的小人书我再也不会看了
<3-26,Sheldon>There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.

214
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,240
<3-27,Christie>你好  我是克里斯蒂
<3-27,Christie>Hi. christy.

215
00:11:59,330 --> 00:11:59,990
<3-28,Leonard>我是里奥纳德
<3-28,Leonard>Leonard.

216
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,970
<3-29,Sheldon>-我是谢尔顿  -对啊
<3-29,Sheldon>-i'm sheldon. -right.

217
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,540
<3-30,Christie>你就是霍华德的随从
<3-30,Christie>You're howard's entourage.

218
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,160
<3-31,Penny>对了  克里斯蒂  你们接下去准备如何
<3-31,Penny>So, christy, what are your plans?

219
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,490
<3-32,Christie>霍华德说他要带我去比佛利山庄购物
<3-32,Christie>Howard said he'd take me shopping in beverly hills.

220
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,630
<3-33,Penny>好啊  不  我意思是说准备去哪里住
<3-33,Penny>Yeah, no, I meant plans to find someplace to live.

221
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,860
<3-33,Penny>而不是跟我一起  不是说我不乐意和你们一起
<3-33,Penny>Other than with me. not that I don't love having you,

222
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,520
<3-33,Penny>只是...地方有点挤
<3-33,Penny>But it's... it's a little crowded.

223
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,640
<3-34,Leonard>潘妮  我们永远欢迎你和我们一起住
<3-34,Leonard>Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.

224
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,500
<3-35,Sheldon>真棒啊  我们这现在经营起小旅馆来了(两个B代表床和早餐)
<3-35,Sheldon>Oh, terrific. now we're running a cute little b & b.

225
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,950
<3-36,Howard>让我来跳出框框  想些别的办法
<3-36,Howard>Let me offer a little outside-the-box thinking here.

226
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,650
<3-36,Howard>为什么克里斯蒂不和我住一起呢
<3-36,Howard>Why doesn't christy stay with me?

227
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,970
<3-37,Leonard>-因为你和你妈住一起  -才不是呢
<3-37,Leonard>-you live with your mother. -i do not.

228
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,650
<3-38,Howard>我妈和我住一起
<3-38,Howard>My mother lives with me.

229
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,870
<3-39,Sheldon>好  都解决了  克里斯蒂和霍华德一起住
<3-39,Sheldon>Then it's all settled. christy will stay with howard,

230
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,320
<3-39,Sheldon>潘妮可以回她房间了
<3-39,Sheldon>Penny can go back to her apartment,

231
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,070
<3-39,Sheldon>而我可以观看后24分钟的"神秘博士"了
<3-39,Sheldon>And I'll watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who.

232
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,300
<3-39,Sheldon>即使就现在而言  更像是"何必呢博士"
<3-39,Sheldon>Although at this point, it's more like doctor why bother?

233
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,010
<3-41,Sheldon>-谢尔顿  你不能就这么发号施令...  -不许再说了!  都给我走!
<3-41,Sheldon>-sheldon, you just can't dictate... -no more talking! everybody go!

234
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,830
<3-42,Howard>你觉得怎么样?  想不想我重新修缮下沃尔维茨之家?
<3-42,Howard>So what do you say? want to repair to casa wolowitz?

235
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,280
<3-43,Christie>那是什么  一家墨西哥熟食店?
<3-43,Christie>What is that, like a mexican deli?

236
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,720
<3-44,Howard>不好意思  我应该早点说的
<3-44,Howard>I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier.

237
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,460
<3-44,Howard>我姓沃尔维茨
<3-44,Howard>My last name is wolowitz.

238
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,410
<3-45,Christie>真是太妙了
<3-45,Christie>That's so cool.

239
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,940
<3-45,Christie>我上的第一个犹太人
<3-45,Christie>My first jew.

240
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,290
<3-46,Sheldon>我看是因为那里没有很多符合犹太人口味的内布拉斯加人
<3-46,Sheldon>I imagine there aren't very many kosher cornhuskers.

241
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,390
<3-47,Christie>你还是会带我去购物吧
<3-47,Christie>But you're still taking me shopping?

242
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,580
<3-48,Howard>你想做什么都可以
<3-48,Howard>Anything you want.

243
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,680
<3-49,Christie>好  我去收拾东西
<3-49,Christie>Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,040
<3-50,Howard>等人类克隆技术完善了  我要去订一打这样的
<3-50,Howard>When they perfect human cloning, I'm going to order 12 of those.

245
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,050
<3-51,Leonard>霍华德  你看不出她在利用你吗?
<3-51,Leonard>Howard. Can't you see she's using you?

246
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,340
<3-52,Howard>管它呢?  昨晚她把上衣脱掉我都哭了
<3-52,Howard>Who cares? last night, she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

247
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,590
<3-53,Penny>听着  霍华德  我了解她  她可以和任何人上床
<3-53,Penny>Look, Howard. I know her. okay? she'll have sex with anyone,

248
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,760
<3-53,Penny>只要那些人一直给她买东西
<3-53,Penny>As long as they keep buying her things.

249
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,780
<3-54,Howard>-真的?  -是啊
<3-54,Howard>-really? -yeah.

250
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,610
<3-54,Howard>好啊!
<3-54,Howard>Yea!

251
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,020
<3-56,Howard>如果你不介意的话  我现在有些犹太教的成年礼要去兑现
<3-56,Howard>If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

252
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,160
<4-1,Sheldon>抱歉  没有沃尔维茨我们办不成
<4-1,Sheldon>I'm sorry, we cannot do this without wolowitz.

253
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,520
<4-2,Leonard>没有沃尔维茨我们就没法点中国菜?
<4-2,Leonard>We can't order chinese food without wolowitz?

254
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,790
<4-3,Sheldon>我来说给你听听
<4-3,Sheldon>Let me walk you through it.

255
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,290
<4-5,Sheldon>我们平时一直这么点的
<4-5,Sheldon>Our standard order is,

256
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,880
<4-3,Sheldon>开胃菜是蒸饺  然后点左宗棠鸡
<4-3,Sheldon>The steamed dumpling appetizer, general tso's chicken,

257
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,890
<4-3,Sheldon>芥兰牛肉  龙汁虾仁
<4-3,Sheldon>Beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce

258
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,500
<4-3,Sheldon>还有杂菜捞面
<4-3,Sheldon>And vegetable lo mein.

259
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,300
<4-3,Sheldon>你发现问题了吗
<4-3,Sheldon>Do you see the problem?

260
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,520
<4-4,Leonard>我看见了一位问题
<4-4,Leonard>I see a problem.

261
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,700
<4-5,Sheldon>我们整个点菜是以四个蒸饺  四个主菜
<4-5,Sheldon>Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees

262
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,940
<4-5,Sheldon>四个人吃为基础的
<4-5,Sheldon>Divided amongst four people.

263
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,090
<4-6,Leonard>-那我们就点三个主菜咯  -可以
<4-6,Leonard>-so, we'll just order three entrees. -fine.

264
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,770
<4-7,Sheldon>你想去掉哪个菜  那个多出来的蒸饺又归谁呢
<4-7,Sheldon>What do you want to eliminate? and who gets the extra dumpling?

265
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,410
<4-8,Raj>我们可以把它一切三啊
<4-8,Raj>We could cut it into thirds.

266
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,460
<4-9,Sheldon>那它就不再是蒸饺了  一旦你切开
<4-9,Sheldon>Then it's no longer a dumpling. once you cut it open it is,

267
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,030
<4-9,Sheldon>它最多就是一个无上皮的小三明治
<4-9,Sheldon>At best, a very small open-faced sandwich.

268
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,810
<4-10,Waiter>好啊  伙计们
<4-10,Waiter>Hi, fellas.

269
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,810
<4-10,Waiter>你们那位自以为会说中文的讨厌鬼哪去了
<4-10,Waiter>Where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks mandarin?

270
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,010
<4-11,Sheldon>他把个人需要置于集体利益之上了
<4-11,Sheldon>He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good.

271
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,460
<4-11,Sheldon>在他的老家  这该当死罪
<4-11,Sheldon>Where he comes from, that's punishable by death.

272
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,090
<4-12,Waiter>我老家是萨克拉门托
<4-12,Waiter>I come from sacramento.

273
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,270
<4-13,Leonard>我们能不能点一份蒸饺  但只要三个不用四个
<4-13,Leonard>Can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four?

274
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,460
<4-14,Waiter>不能换
<4-14,Waiter>No substitutions.

275
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,590
<4-15,Leonard>这不是换  这是减量
<4-15,Leonard>This isn't a substitution. it's a reduction.

276
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,470
<4-16,Waiter>好吧  不能减量
<4-16,Waiter>Okay. no reductions.

277
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,560
<4-17,Leonard>好吧  帮我们点三份蒸饺
<4-17,Leonard>Fine. bring us three orders of dumplings.

278
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,930
<4-18,Raj>-一共12个  我们每人四个  -那行啊
<4-18,Raj>-that's 12. we'll each have four. -that works.

279
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,670
<4-19,Sheldon>如果我们吃蒸饺吃饱了  我们就得再去掉一道主菜
<4-19,Sheldon>If we fill up on dumplings, we need to eliminate another entree.

280
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,050
<4-20,Waiter>不能去掉
<4-20,Waiter>No eliminations.

281
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,010
<4-21,Leonard>如果有吃下来多余的  我们就打包带回家好了
<4-21,Leonard>If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.

282
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,620
<4-22,Sheldon>那怎么分呢?  我已经说了  没有沃尔维茨我们办不到
<4-22,Sheldon>And divide it how? I'm telling you, we cannot do this without wolowitz.

283
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,440
<4-23,Leonard>沃尔维茨和他新女友在一起
<4-23,Leonard>Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend.

284
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,090
<4-23,Leonard>如果你同意我请潘妮来的话  那就有你所要的第四个人了
<4-23,Leonard>If you had let me invite penny, then you would have had your fourth.

285
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,850
<4-24,Sheldon>你有见过潘妮吃中国菜吗
<4-24,Sheldon>Have you seen penny eat chinese food?

286
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,320
<4-24,Sheldon>她是用叉子的  她吃蛋皮春卷还要蘸两次酱
<4-24,Sheldon>She uses a fork and she double-dips her egg rolls.

287
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,800
<4-25,Leonard>-我们不点蛋皮春卷  -没错
<4-25,Leonard>-we don't order egg rolls. -exactly,

288
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,440
<4-26,Sheldon>但如果她在这儿我们就得点了
<4-26,Sheldon>But we'd have to if she was here!

289
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,050
<4-27,Raj>我们能不能快点决定
<4-27,Raj>Can we please make a decision?

290
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,070
<4-27,Raj>不光印度那儿有孩子在挨饿
<4-27,Raj>Not only are there children starving in india,

291
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,840
<4-27,Raj>这儿还正有一个印度人在挨饿
<4-27,Raj>There's an indian starving right here.

292
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,990
<4-28,Leonard>这样吧  索性我们去吃印度菜
<4-28,Leonard>There's an idea. why don't we just go out for indian food?

293
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,870
<4-30,Raj>你们真是有意思
<4-30,Raj>You're nice boys.

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,510
<4-31,Waiter>我看这么着吧
<4-31,Waiter>Tell you what I'm going to do.

295
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,590
<4-31,Waiter>我给你们上四个蒸饺
<4-31,Waiter>I'm going to bring you the four dumplings.

296
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,510
<4-31,Waiter>等我待会儿走过来时  或许我被绊一跤
<4-31,Waiter>When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped,

297
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,510
<4-31,Waiter>里面一只蒸饺掉到地上  没人知道嘛
<4-31,Waiter>One of the dumplings fall to the floor. no one has to know.

298
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,460
<4-32,Sheldon>我会知道的
<4-32,Sheldon>I'll know.

299
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,960
<4-35,Leonard>-点汤怎么样  -对  汤我们总是能分的
<4-35,Leonard>-how about soup? -yeah, we can always divide soup.

300
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,650
<4-36,Sheldon>馄饨怎么办
<4-36,Sheldon>What about the wontons?

301
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,680
<5-1,Penny (answering)>是你们啊  什么事
<5-1,Penny (answering)>Hey, guys, what's up?

302
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,130
<5-2,Sheldon>今晚是光晕之夜
<5-2,Sheldon>It's halo night.

303
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,230
<5-3,Penny>是吧  不错啊
<5-3,Penny>Yeah. OK.

304
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,840
<5-3,Penny>怎么?
<5-3,Penny>So?

305
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,930
<5-4,Leonard>因为沃尔维茨整天都陪着你那朋友克里斯蒂...
<5-4,Leonard>With wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christy...

306
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,950
<5-4,Leonard>她不是我朋友
<5-4,Leonard>She's not my friend.

307
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,720
<5-5,Penny>朋友是不会把朋友的可爱小熊弄得都浑身湿答答的
<5-5,Penny>Friends do not get their friends' care bears all sweaty.

308
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,630
<5-6,Leonard>没错  总之  因为沃尔维茨忙着干别的
<5-6,Leonard>Right. anyway, uh, with wolowitz occupied elsewhere,

309
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,630
<5-6,Leonard>我们有件事想请求你
<5-6,Leonard>We had something we wanted to ask you.

310
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,220
<5-6,Leonard>谢尔顿
<5-6,Leonard>Sheldon?

311
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,420
<5-6,Leonard>在
<5-6,Leonard>Yes.

312
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,350
<5-7,Sheldon>潘妮
<5-7,Sheldon>Penny.

313
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,450
<5-7,Sheldon>如果你愿意成为我们光晕团队的
<5-7,Sheldon>We would very much appreciate it

314
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,920
<5-7,Sheldon>第四位队员  我们会非常高兴
<5-7,Sheldon>If you would be the fourth member of our halo team.

315
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,590
<5-7,Sheldon>我想我不用提这是一种何等的荣幸了
<5-7,Sheldon>I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.

316
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,110
<5-8,Penny>真是太好了  但我要出去和一个女伴跳舞了
<5-8,Penny>That's so sweet, but I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.

317
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,690
<5-9,Sheldon>你不能出去  这是光晕之夜啊
<5-9,Sheldon>You can't go out; it's halo night.

318
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,930
<5-11,Sheldon>-对潘妮来说  这是跳舞之夜  -你每周三都去跳舞?
<5-11,Sheldon>-well, for penny, it's dancing night. -you go dancing every wednesday?

319
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,240
<5-13,Sheldon>-不是  -那这就不能叫"跳舞之夜"
<5-13,Sheldon>-no. -then that's not "dancing night."

320
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,800
<5-14,Penny>这样  我明天和你们玩怎么样
<5-14,Penny>Look, Why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?

321
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,060
<5-15,Sheldon>今晚才是光晕之夜  怎么像对牛弹琴
<5-15,Sheldon>Tonight is halo night. it's like talking to a wall.

322
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,920
<5-16,Penny>够了  谢尔顿  看来你和我又要对着干了
<5-16,Penny>All right, now, sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.

323
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,970
<5-17,Leonard>谢尔顿  你忘了我们排练过的
<5-17,Leonard>Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.

324
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,670
<5-18,Sheldon>是  可你没像她这么完全不讲理啊
<5-18,Sheldon>Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.

325
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,500
<5-19,Penny>好了  伙计们  我要走了
<5-19,Penny>All right, fellas, I gotta go.

326
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,780
<5-19,Penny>你们好好玩
<5-19,Penny>But good luck.

327
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,340
<5-20,Leonard>或许我们该问问
<5-20,Leonard>Maybe we should've asked her

328
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,620
<5-20,Leonard>是否可以跟她和她的女伴一起去跳舞
<5-20,Leonard>if we could go dancing with her and  girlfriend.

329
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,060
<5-21,Sheldon>好吧  先假设我们会跳舞  实际上我们还不会
<5-21,Sheldon>OK. Assuming we could dance-- which we can't--

330
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,360
<5-21,Sheldon>我们有三个人  而她们只有两个
<5-21,Sheldon>There are three of us and two of them.

331
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,350
<5-22,Leonard>又如何
<5-22,Leonard>So?

332
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,010
<5-23,Sheldon>意味着又要上演一遍中国餐馆事件
<5-23,Sheldon>It's the chinese restaurant all over again.

333
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,930
<5-23,Sheldon>我保证把一个蒸饺切成三份
<5-23,Sheldon>I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds

334
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,930
<5-23,Sheldon>比起一个男人要和0.67个女人跳舞来说
<5-23,Sheldon>Is child's play compared with three men

335
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,390
<5-23,Sheldon>那还算是小孩子把戏
<5-23,Sheldon>Each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.

336
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,940
<5-24,Leonard>上帝保佑  谢尔顿  你要把我逼疯了
<5-24,Leonard>For god's sakes, sheldon, you're driving me crazy!

337
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,450
<5-25,Sheldon>你这不是在生我的气  先生  你这是在生数学的气
<5-25,Sheldon>Your anger is not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.

338
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,220
<5-26,Leonard>我蛮肯定我这是在生你的气
<5-26,Leonard>I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

339
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,040
<5-27,Raj>我们到底怎么了  我们正在分崩离析
<5-27,Raj>What's happening to us? we're falling apart.

340
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,270
<5-29,Sheldon>-你准备打给谁  -唯一一个能
<5-29,Sheldon>-who are you calling? -the only man who can restore

341
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,790
<5-29,Sheldon>让我们这里稍显一点平衡的人
<5-29,Sheldon>Any semblance of balance to our universe.

342
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,880
<5-30,Howard (voice)>你好  我是霍华德·沃尔维茨
<5-30,Howard (voice)>Hi, this is howard wolowitz.

343
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,590
<5-31,Christie (voice)>我是克里斯蒂·范德贝尔特
<5-31,Christie (voice)>And this is christy vanderbelt.

344
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,930
<5-32,Howard (voice)>我们现在不能接电话  因为我们正在做爱!
<5-32,Howard (voice)>We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex!

345
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,640
<5-33,Christie (voice)>你不会就拿这个做留言吧
<5-33,Christie (voice)>You're not going to put that on your message, are you?

346
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,320
<5-34,Howard (voice)>当然不会  只是开个玩笑  我会重新录
<5-34,Howard (voice)>Nah, I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.

347
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,700
<6-1,Leonard>谢尔顿  你得三思  你这是让霍华德在性爱与光晕之间
<6-1,Leonard>Sheldon, think this through. you're going to ask howard to choose

348
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,080
<6-1,Leonard>做出抉择
<6-1,Leonard>Between sex and halo.

349
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,860
<6-1,Leonard>不  我是让他在性爱与光晕Ⅲ之间做出抉择
<6-1,Leonard>No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and halo three.

350
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,460
<6-2,Sheldon>就我所知  性爱还没有被升级到
<6-2,Sheldon>As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded

351
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,680
<6-2,Sheldon>拥有高清图像以及加强版武器装备
<6-2,Sheldon>To include hi-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.

352
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,580
<6-3,Leonard>你说的对  性爱只是裸体  高潮  还有人与人自然的交流
<6-3,Leonard>You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.

353
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,210
<6-4,Sheldon>说的正是
<6-4,Sheldon>My point.

354
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,230
<6-5,Christie (voice from within)>你就不能偶尔把该死的塑料纸撕下来吗!
<6-5,Christie (voice from within)>You can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while!

355
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,440
<6-6,Howard’s Mother (voice)>干吗  这样你和霍华德就可以在上面搞了?!
<6-6,Howard’s Mother (voice)>Why, so you and howard can hump on it?!

356
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,580
<6-7,Howard (voice)>女士们  女士们  我想肯定还是有折中的办法
<6-7,Howard (voice)>Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground.

357
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,000
<6-8,Christie and Howard’s Mother together>住嘴  霍华德
<6-8,Christie and Howard’s Mother together>Shut up, howard!

358
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,430
<6-9,Howard (voice)>你们慢慢说  我出去骑小摩托转一圈
<6-9,Howard (voice)>You guys talk. I'm gonna take my scooter out for a little spin.

359
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,970
<6-10,Christie (voice as Howard emerges through door)>你开心了?  你把你自己儿子赶出家门了
<6-10,Christie (voice as Howard emerges through door)>You happy? you drove your own son out of the house.

360
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,560
<6-11,Howard’s Mother (voice)>你为什么不...
<6-11,Howard’s Mother (voice)>Why don't you stop...

361
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,030
<6-12,Howard>你们在这里干什么
<6-12,Howard>What are you doing here?

362
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,630
<6-13,Sheldon>今晚是光晕之夜啊
<6-13,Sheldon>It's halo night.

363
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,770
<6-14,Howard’s Mother (voice)>他不是个男人  他只是个白痴
<6-14,Howard’s Mother (voice)>He's not a man, he's a putz!

364
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,340
<6-14,Howard’s Mother (voice)>你别用那口气跟我说话  你个骗财女!
<6-14,Howard’s Mother (voice)>And don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger!

365
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,140
<6-15,Christie (voice)>-你说我什么?  -你听到了
<6-15,Christie (voice)>-what'd you call me? -you heard me!

366
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,320
<6-16,Howard’s Mother (voice)>我还要告诉你  你找错对象了
<6-16,Howard’s Mother (voice)>And I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree.

367
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,510
<6-16,Howard’s Mother (voice)>因为只要让我再见到你  我遗嘱里就没有霍华德这个名字
<6-16,Howard’s Mother (voice)>Cause as long as you're around, howard is out of the will!

368
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,800
<6-17,Christie>我告诉你  我有更好的人选  我走了
<6-17,Christie>You know what? I got better offers. I'm outta here.

369
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,120
<6-18,Howard’s Mother (voice)>这就对了  回巴比伦(那里盛产妓女)去吧  你个妓女
<6-18,Howard’s Mother (voice)>That's right. go back to babylon, you whore!

370
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,530
<6-19,Howard>光晕之夜  是吧
<6-19,Howard>So, halo night, huh?

371
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,250
<6-20,Raj>我还以为她是奥马哈来的妓女
<6-20,Raj>I thought she was the whore of omaha.

372
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,590
<7-1,Howard>谢尔顿  他就在你射程之内  射击!  他正在给等离子来福枪充电
<7-1,Howard>Sheldon, you got him in your sights! fire! he's charging his plasma rifle!

373
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,490
<7-2,Sheldon>我现在不能射击  我正隐身着!
<7-2,Sheldon>I can't shoot now. I'm cloaking!

374
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,770
<7-3,Leonard>-拉杰  快干了谢尔顿  -我看不见他!
<7-3,Leonard>-raj! kill sheldon! -i can't see him!

375
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,270
<7-5,Sheldon>所以这才叫做隐身  呆子
<7-5,Sheldon>That's why they call it cloaking, dead man!

376
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,110
<7-6,Leonard>-那扔手榴弹啊!  -我用完了!
<7-6,Leonard>-start throwing grenades! -i'm all out!

377
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,220
<7-8,Penny (entering with three other sexy women)>伙计们  我和我朋友们跳舞跳累了
<7-8,Penny (entering with three other sexy women)>Hey, guys. my friends and I got tired of dancing,

378
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,580
<7-8,Penny (entering with three other sexy women)>所以我们过来想和你们做爱
<7-8,Penny (entering with three other sexy women)>So we came over to have sex with you.

379
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,410
<7-9,Leonard>拉杰  跳到坦克里来!
<7-9,Leonard>Raj, hop in the tank!

380
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,180
<7-11,Raj>-我们说好不准用坦克的!  -都死了还讲什么规则!
<7-11,Raj>-we said no tanks! -there are no rules in hell!

381
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,750
<7-12,Howard>该死的  医疗装备!  我需要医疗装备!
<7-12,Howard>Son of a bitch. med pack! I need a med pack!

382
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,690
<7-13,Penny>我说的吧
<7-13,Penny>Told ya.

383
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,510
<7-14,Leonard>那里有个狙击兵  快用你那火箭筒!
<7-14,Leonard>There's a sniper. use your rocket launcher!

384
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,120
<7-15,Raj>只有你在对我嚷嚷  我已经没子弹啦!
<7-15,Raj>All I've got is a needler and I'm all out of ammo!

385
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,100
<7-16,Sheldon>现在你去死吧
<7-16,Sheldon>And now you're out of life.

386
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,540
<7-16,Sheldon>你干吗按暂停?
<7-16,Sheldon>Why'd you hit pause?

387
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,490
<7-17,Leonard>我好像听到...什么声音
<7-17,Leonard>I thought I heard... something.

388
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,590
<7-18,Raj>什么?
<7-18,Raj>What?

389
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,740
<7-19,Leonard>没什么  算了  继续吧
<7-19,Leonard>No, never mind. It's all right. Go.
