<1-5,Priya>我来一份肉馅土豆泥饼
<1-5,Priya>Uh, I'll have the shepherd's pie.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,580
<1-5,Priya>你想和我分着吃一份吗
<1-5,Priya>You want to split that with me?

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,330
<1-6,Leonard>别别别  他不会愿意的
<1-6,Leonard>Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,770
<1-7,Priya>为啥
<1-7,Priya>Why not?

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,070
<1-8,Leonard>土豆泥里面有牛奶
<1-8,Leonard>Well, you have milk in the taters,

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,050
<1-8,Leonard>肉汁里面有牛奶  还有帕尔玛干酪饼皮
<1-8,Leonard>milk in the gravy, parmesan crust.

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,710
<1-8,Leonard>你这位乳糖不耐的男朋友会变成
<1-8,Leonard>Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn

10
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,750
<1-8,Leonard>一个充气的感恩节大气球
<1-8,Leonard>into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon.

11
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,860
<1-9,Sheldon>你说的不全对
<1-9,Sheldon>Not quite accurate.

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,070
<1-9,Sheldon>感恩节气球里充的都是氦气
<1-9,Sheldon>The Macy's balloons are filled with helium,

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,400
<1-9,Sheldon>而莱纳德肚子里造出来的是大量的甲烷
<1-9,Sheldon>whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,250
<1-10,Leonard>所以  还是别点肉馅土豆泥饼了
<1-10,Leonard>So, no, on the shepherd's pie.

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:36,880
<1-10,Leonard>能接着点菜吗
<1-10,Leonard>Can we move on?

16

<1-11,Penny>千万别信
<1-11,Penny>Do not believe it.

<1-12,Leonard>Sea bass! I'll have the sea bass!

23
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,080
<1-15,Sheldon>没用的  人体能在死亡数小时内
<1-15,Sheldon>It wouldn't help. The human body is capable

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,790
<1-15,Sheldon>一直制造气体
<1-15,Sheldon>of being flatulent for hours after death.

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,020
<1-17,Sheldon>有人想对莱纳德糟糕的消化系统
<1-17,Sheldon>does anyone have any final comments on

29
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,990
<1-17,Sheldon>来个终极吐槽吗

42
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,080
<1-26,Sheldon>除非他能随伯纳黛特的姓
<1-26,Sheldon>Unless he takes Bernadette's last name.

43
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,610
<1-26,Sheldon>考虑到伯纳黛特的地位更高
<1-26,Sheldon>And considering her advanced status,

44
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,780
<1-26,Sheldon>这么做未尝不可
<1-26,Sheldon>that could open some doors for him.

45
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,540
<1-27,Howard>拜托  今天的主角不是我
<1-27,Howard>Please, this isn't about me.

<1-28,Bernadette>I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company.

49
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,500
<1-28,Bernadette>他们要给我提供巨额薪金
<1-28,Bernadette>They're gonna pay me a buttload of money!

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,600
<1-29,Howard>什么
<1-29,Howard>What?

51
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,540
<1-30,Leonard>伯纳黛特  这太好了
<1-30,Leonard>Bernadette, that's great.

52
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,640
<1-30,Leonard>霍华德  你能挣巨额的钱吗
<1-30,Leonard>Howard, do you make a buttload?

53
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,970
<1-31,Howard>反正比你放巨额的屁强
<1-31,Howard>Better than what you've got a buttload of.

54
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,650
<1-32,Leonard>喂  要是我摇下车窗玻璃  一切都还是很美好的
<1-32,Leonard>Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's peachy.

55
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,070
<1-32,Leonard>可如果你也这么做  你还是当不了博士
<1-32,Leonard>If you do it, you're still not a doctor.

56
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,040
<1-33,Penny>嗯  车窗户这这句我得吐个槽
<1-33,Penny>Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal.

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,300
<1-33,Penny>虽然说得对  但不是每件事都那么美好
<1-33,Penny>It helps, but everything is not "peachy."

<2-5,Leonard (off)>放心吧  他带着耳机呢
<2-5,Leonard (off)>Relax, he's got headphones on.

69
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,380
<2-5,Leonard (off)>而我们正在距地球16公里远的星际飞船里呢
<2-5,Leonard (off)>And we're ten miles above Earth in a starship.

70
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,280
<2-6,Raj>开玩笑吧  才16公里
<2-6,Raj>Really, ten miles?

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,620
<2-6,Raj>还在大气层里转悠啊
<2-6,Raj>You're orbiting inside the atmosphere?

<2-7,Priya (off)>我真不敢相信我在穿我哥的万圣节化妆服
<2-7,Priya (off)>I can't believe I'm wearing my brother's Halloween costume.

75
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,220
<2-8,Leonard (off)>我真不敢相信你真以为他只在万圣节的时候穿
<2-8,Leonard (off)>I can't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween.

76

<2-8,Leonard (off)>打开"降落舱门"  "航天飞机"正在进入
<2-8,Leonard (off)>Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.

<3-3,Howard>不是  妈  是拉杰
<3-3,Howard>No, Ma! It's Raj!

<3-4,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>-他也是博士  对吗  -对
<3-4,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>- He's a doctor too, right?! - Yes!

82
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,340
<3-6,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>跟莱纳德和那个竹竿子一样
<3-6,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!

83
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,130
<3-7,Howard>那是谢尔顿  没错
<3-7,Howard>Sheldon, yes!

84
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,660
<3-7,Howard>除了我  大家都是博士
<3-7,Howard>Everybody's a doctor but me!

85
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,240
<3-8,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>那能怪谁呢
<3-8,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Well, whose fault is that?!

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,120
<3-9,Howard>怎么了
<3-9,Howard>What's up?

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,810
<3-10,Raj>莱纳德在我的记忆海绵床垫上
<3-10,Raj>Leonard's putting disgusting memories in

88
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,240
<3-10,Raj>制造恶心的记忆

<3-10,Raj>我今晚能睡你这儿吗
<3-10,Raj>Can I stay here tonight?

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,020
<3-11,Howard>所以就你和我妈在家
<3-11,Howard>It'll just be you and my mother.

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,430
<3-12,Raj>我猜应该没事吧
<3-12,Raj>I guess that's okay.

93
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,060
<3-13,Howard>妈  拉杰能睡这儿吗
<3-13,Howard>Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!

<3-14,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>行啊  他可以和我玩扮医生的游戏[doctor也有医生的意思]
<3-14,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Of course, he and I can play doctor!

95
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,380
<3-15,Raj>她在开玩笑  对吧
<3-15,Raj>She's kidding, right?

96
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,030
<3-16,Howard>我不知道  自从接受荷尔蒙替换治疗之后
<3-16,Howard>I don't know, she's pretty feisty since

97
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,060
<3-16,Howard>她就变得精力充沛了
<3-16,Howard>they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.

98
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,930
<3-17,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>呼叫小可爱医生
<3-17,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!

99
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,890
<4-1,Sheldon>我不得不说  艾米  我对于
<4-1,Sheldon>I must say, Amy, I was very impressed

100
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,220
<4-1,Sheldon>伯纳黛特拿到博士学位感到非常惊讶
<4-1,Sheldon>to see that Bernadette got her PhD.

101
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,670
<4-2,Amy>确实令人钦佩
<4-2,Amy>It's indeed admirable.

102
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,190
<4-2,Amy>虽然  她是搞  微生物学的
<4-2,Amy>Although, it is... microbiology.

103
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,370
<4-3,Sheldon>你的博士学位是神经生物学的
<4-3,Sheldon>Your doctorate is in neurobiology.

104
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,060
<4-3,Sheldon>我看不出什么差别
<4-3,Sheldon>I fail to see the distinction.

105
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,630
<4-4,Amy>我就这么跟你说吧
<4-4,Amy>I'll make it simple for you.

106
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,950
<4-4,Amy>我研究的是大脑
<4-4,Amy>I study the brain,

107
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,510
<4-4,Amy>这是能让贝多芬写出《命运交响曲》的器官
<4-4,Amy>the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

108
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,920
<4-4,Amy>而伯纳黛特研究的是酵母菌
<4-4,Amy>Bernadette studies yeast,

109
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,730
<4-4,Amy>是用来制造Michelob Lite啤酒的有机体
<4-4,Amy>the organism responsible for Michelob Lite.

110
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,540
<4-4,Amy>你的脖子不舒服吗
<4-4,Amy>Is there something wrong with your neck?

111
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,510
<4-5,Sheldon>有点僵硬
<4-5,Sheldon>It's a little stiff.

112
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,570
<4-5,Sheldon>如此不堪一击的结构
<4-5,Sheldon>What a remarkably fragile structure

113
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,180
<4-5,Sheldon>却要支撑如此价值连城的设备
<4-5,Sheldon>to support such a valuable payload.

114
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,660
<4-5,Sheldon>这无异于用精灵粉末糖来支撑皇室珠宝彩蛋
<4-5,Sheldon>Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.

115
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,150
<4-6,Amy>你考虑过做个按摩吗
<4-6,Amy>Have you considered massage?

116
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,430
<4-7,Sheldon>我想用讽刺的口吻来回答你的问题
<4-7,Sheldon>I'd like to respond to that sarcastically:

117
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,500
<4-7,Sheldon>是的  让一个陌生人给我的身体涂油并按压
<4-7,Sheldon>Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body

118
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,540
<4-7,Sheldon>这个想法很不错
<4-7,Sheldon>with oil and rubbing it.

119
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,410
<4-8,Amy>我是建议你亲手对自己的肌肉进行按摩
<4-8,Amy>I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.

120
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,040
<4-9,Sheldon>那还是会涉及到很多不必要的触碰
<4-9,Sheldon>Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.

121
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,950
<4-10,Amy>相信我
<4-10,Amy>Trust me.

122
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,970
<4-10,Amy>伸出你的右手
<4-10,Amy>With your right hand,

123
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,650
<4-10,Amy>找到肩胛骨和肩峰的交界处
<4-10,Amy>locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.

124
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,210
<4-11,Sheldon>好了
<4-11,Sheldon>All right.

125
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,890
<4-12,Amy>然后用右手中指沿肩胛的突起进行按压
<4-12,Amy>Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade,

126
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,510
<4-12,Amy>同时小幅度揉动
<4-12,Amy>making a small rotation as you do so.

127
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,920
<4-13,Sheldon>揉着呢
<4-13,Sheldon>Rotating.

128
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,310
<4-14,Amy>你应该能感觉到有一个突起的结构
<4-14,Amy>You should feel a small node-like object

129
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,700
<4-14,Amy>在沿着骨头前后滚动
<4-14,Amy>rolling back and forth along the bone.

130
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,330
<4-15,Sheldon>你是指肌筋膜点吗
<4-15,Sheldon>You mean the myofascial point?

131
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,800
<4-16,Amy>不然呢
<4-16,Amy>Obviously.

132
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,690
<4-16,Amy>接着向其施力
<4-16,Amy>Now bear down on it

133
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,870
<4-16,Amy>就像我们熟悉的七年级生
<4-16,Amy>like the seventh grade noogies

134
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,580
<4-16,Amy>欺负人用的经典按头动作
<4-16,Amy>we all know too well.

135
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,940
<4-17,Sheldon>额滴神啊  爽  爽  爽
<4-17,Sheldon>Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes!

136
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,210
<4-17,Sheldon>艾米  以前从来没人这么摸过我
<4-17,Sheldon>Amy, I've never been touched like this before!

137
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,790
<4-17,Sheldon>我的手简直是神来之手啊
<4-17,Sheldon>Oh! My hands are magic!

138
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,180
<4-18,Amy>别自吹自擂了
<4-18,Amy>Don't flatter yourself.

139
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,530
<4-18,Amy>你的手不过是在本人神经系统知识指导下的
<4-18,Amy>Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge

140
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,210
<4-18,Amy>一个愚钝的工具而已
<4-18,Amy>of the nervous system.

141
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,800
<4-18,Amy>我刚也可以轻易地让你瘫痪
<4-18,Amy>I could just as easily have paralyzed you.

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,340
<4-19,Sheldon>有人在敲门
<4-19,Sheldon>There's someone at my door.

143
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,490
<4-20,Amy>我对此不感兴趣  拜拜
<4-20,Amy>That doesn't interest me. Good-bye.

144
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,960
<4-21,Raj (at door)>-我能在这里过夜吗  -凭什么
<4-21,Raj (at door)>- Can I sleep here tonight? - Why?

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,690
<4-23,Raj>莱纳德正和我妹妹进行星际迷航式的性交
<4-23,Raj>Leonard's having astronomically inaccurate

146
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,010
<4-23,Raj>那从天文学角度来说很不科学
<4-23,Raj>Star Trek sex with my sister.

147
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,530
<4-24,Sheldon>的确很令人心烦意乱  进来吧
<4-24,Sheldon>I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in.

148
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,500
<4-24,Sheldon>我去拿铺在沙发上的床单和毯子
<4-24,Sheldon>I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.

149
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,480
<4-25,Raj>不用了  我去莱纳德的房间睡就行
<4-25,Raj>Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.

150
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,250
<4-26,Sheldon>不行  我不能授权
<4-26,Sheldon>No, I can't authorize that.

151
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,310
<4-27,Raj>他能睡在我床上  我为啥不能睡在他床上
<4-27,Raj>Well, he's in my bed. Why can't I be in his?

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,080
<4-28,Sheldon>汉谟拉比法典上规定可以"以眼还眼"
<4-28,Sheldon>The Hammurabic Code is "an eye for an eye,"

153
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,670
<4-28,Sheldon>而并非"以床还床"
<4-28,Sheldon>not "a bed for a bed."

154
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,860
<4-29,Raj>行行好  哥们  我快累死了
<4-29,Raj>Come on, dude, I'm exhausted,

155
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,680
<4-29,Raj>提拉·班克斯说过
<4-29,Raj>and Tyra Banks says

157
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,350
<4-29,Raj>化妆包里最重要的一样东西
<4-29,Raj>the most important item in your makeup bag

158
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,840
<4-29,Raj>就是夜晚香甜的睡眠
<4-29,Raj>is a good night's sleep.

159
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,320
<4-29,Raj>好吧
<4-29,Raj>All right.

160
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,080
<4-30,Sheldon>要想使用"莱纳德的卧室"
<4-30,Sheldon>This is a form indemnifying me

161
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,180
<4-30,Sheldon>需要先签署这张我的免责表
<4-30,Sheldon>from your use of "Leonard's bedroom."

162
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,680
<4-30,Sheldon>在这里签字  说明我试图阻止过你
<4-30,Sheldon>Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you

163
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,710
<4-30,Sheldon>并摆出过严厉的面部表情
<4-30,Sheldon>and did so using a stern facial expression.

164
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,640
<4-31,Raj>-晚安  谢尔顿  -等等  还没完
<4-31,Raj>- Good night, Sheldon.  - Wait. Not yet.

165
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,300
<4-32,Sheldon>我们还要重温一下安全规程
<4-32,Sheldon>We still have to go over safety procedures.

166
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,500
<4-32,Sheldon>这间公寓里共有三个紧急出口  分别在
<4-32,Sheldon>Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located

167
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,310
<4-32,Sheldon>这里  这里和这里
<4-32,Sheldon>here, here, and here.

168
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,890
<4-32,Sheldon>万一遇到停电事故
<4-32,Sheldon>In the event of a power outage,

169
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,110
<4-32,Sheldon>夜光漆可指引你从最近的出口逃生
<4-32,Sheldon>luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.

170
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,860
<4-33,Raj>开玩笑吧你
<4-33,Raj>You're kidding.

171
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,860
<4-34,Sheldon>在安全问题上  我从不儿戏
<4-34,Sheldon>I never kid about safety.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,490
<5-1,Leonard>你在我房间里干什么
<5-1,Leonard>What are you doing here?

173
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,580
<5-2,Raj>睡觉啊
<5-2,Raj>I was sleeping.

174
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,560
<5-3,Leonard>在我床上
<5-3,Leonard>In my bed?

175
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,900
<5-4,Raj>我也想睡在自己的床上
<5-4,Raj>Well, I would've slept in my own bed,

176
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,580
<5-4,Raj>但它却用来给我的家庭带来耻辱
<5-4,Raj>but it was being used to bring shame to my family.

177
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,660
<5-4,Raj>还让我想起来了吉恩·罗登贝瑞
<5-4,Raj>And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.

179
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,970
<5-5,Leonard>你听见了吗
<5-5,Leonard>Oh, you heard?

180
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,920
<5-6,Raj>"史考特  我需要更多的能量"
<5-6,Raj>"Scotty, I need more power."

181
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,190
<5-7,Leonard>抱歉  谢尔顿知道你睡在这里吗
<5-7,Leonard>Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?

182
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,130
<5-8,Raj>怎么可能不知道  他逼我签了免责书
<5-8,Raj>Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver,

183
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,250
<5-8,Raj>参加了紧急消防演习
<5-8,Raj>participate in an emergency fire drill

184
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,030
<5-8,Raj>还复习了心脏复苏术的课程
<5-8,Raj>and take a refresher course in CPR.

185
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,490
<5-8,Raj>还好他有个人体模型
<5-8,Raj>Thank God he had a dummy.

186
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,360
<5-9,Leonard>是啊  嘴对嘴的莫娜
<5-9,Leonard>Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona.

187
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,860
<5-9,Leonard>知道吗  她和霍华德谈过恋爱
<5-9,Leonard>You know, she used to date Howard?

188
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,920
<5-10,Raj>天啊  她就是那个莫娜吗
<5-10,Raj>Oh, my God, she's that Mona?

189
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,630
<5-10,Raj>你和我妹妹为什么不能在这里共度春宵呢
<5-10,Raj>Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?

190
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,770
<5-11,Leonard>我们试过  但是她和谢尔顿合不来
<5-11,Leonard>We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.

191
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,220
<5-11,Leonard>谢尔顿跟他自己都合不来
<5-11,Leonard>Sheldon doesn't get along with Sheldon.

192
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,690
<5-12,Raj>但那也不足以说服我听你的话
<5-12,Raj>It's still no reason for me to have to listen to you

193
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,610
<5-12,Raj>每晚都要装备上光子鱼雷
<5-12,Raj>arm your photon torpedoes every night.

194
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,540
<5-13,Leonard>好吧  不如这样
<5-13,Leonard>Okay, well, how about this:

195
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,210
<5-13,Leonard>在普丽娅找到自己的住处之前
<5-13,Leonard>until Priya gets her own place,

196
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,790
<5-13,Leonard>你住在这里  而我住在你家
<5-13,Leonard>you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment.

197
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,630
<5-14,Raj>我能带女孩过来吗
<5-14,Raj>Can I bring girls here?

198
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,000
<5-14,Raj>就凭你
<5-14,Raj>You?

199
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,260
<5-15,Leonard>当然了  想带多少带多少
<5-15,Leonard>Sure. Bring as many as you want.

200
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,980
<5-16,Raj>好的  就这么定了
<5-16,Raj>Okay, deal.

201
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,690
<5-17,Leonard>别强迫她们就行了
<5-17,Leonard>Just not against their will.

202
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,640
<6-1,Leonard>你觉得吃那块蛋糕合适吗
<6-1,Leonard>You really think you should be eating that cake?

203
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,710
<6-2,Howard>怎么了
<6-2,Howard>Why?

204
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,600
<6-3,Leonard>鉴于你即将成为富婆的小白脸老公
<6-3,Leonard>If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife,

205
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,650
<6-3,Leonard>你可要注意自己的腰围啊
<6-3,Leonard>you might want to watch your waistline.

206
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,720
<6-3,Leonard>他说得对
<6-3,Leonard>He's right.

207
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,790
<6-4,Raj>嘴上一时享受  臀上一世肥肉
<6-4,Raj>A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.

208
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
<6-5,Howard>是啊  真幽默
<6-5,Howard>Yeah, ha-ha.

209
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,260
<6-5,Howard>首先  我未婚妻的成功并没对我造成威胁
<6-5,Howard>First of all, I'm not threatened by my fiance's success.

210
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,200
<6-5,Howard>我为她感到骄傲
<6-5,Howard>I'm proud of her.

211
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,950
<6-5,Howard>其次  我拥有自己的事业
<6-5,Howard>And secondly, I have my own career.

212
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,680
<6-6,Leonard>有了孩子可就不一样了
<6-6,Leonard>Until you have kids.

213
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,060
<6-7,Sheldon>好消息  拉杰
<6-7,Sheldon>Good news, Raj.

214
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,220
<6-7,Sheldon>我刚从实验室取回了你的血样报告
<6-7,Sheldon>I got the blood work back from the lab.

215
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,370
<6-7,Sheldon>你可以在我家待上一段时间了
<6-7,Sheldon>You're okay to stay for a while.

216
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,540
<6-8,Raj>你什么时候帮我抽的血
<6-8,Raj>When did you take my blood?

217
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,080
<6-9,Sheldon>这不重要
<6-9,Sheldon>Not important.

218
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,190
<6-9,Sheldon>你血糖有点偏高
<6-9,Sheldon>Your sugar was a little high.

219
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,580

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,920
<6-10,Raj>这又是什么东东
<6-10,Raj>What the hell is this?

223
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
<6-11,Sheldon>都是些陈辞滥调啦
<6-11,Sheldon>Boilerplate stuff.

232
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
<6-16,Raj>好吧  这样挺公平
<6-16,Raj>Well, that seems fair.

<10-28,Leonard>如果你回印度  我们肯定是要分手的
<10-28,Leonard>If you're moving back to India, we're obviously breaking up.

<10-29,Priya>那啥  我现在不想讨论这个问题
<10-29,Priya>You know what? I don't want to deal with this right now.
