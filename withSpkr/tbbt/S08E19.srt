00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,910
<1-1,Sheldon>莱纳德  我们在伯克利分校教课的开场笑话
<1-1,Sheldon>Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,490
<1-1,Sheldon>我费了不少功夫准备
<1-1,Sheldon>for our lecture at Berkeley.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,850
<1-2,Leonard>我是挺喜欢笑
<1-2,Leonard>Oh, I like to laugh.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,780
<1-2,Leonard>不过你想说就说吧
<1-2,Leonard>But say it anyway.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,380
<1-3,Sheldon>好吧
<1-3,Sheldon>Okay, um...

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,970
<1-3,Sheldon>你该跟伯克利分校的
<1-3,Sheldon>What do you say to a graduate

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,310
<1-3,Sheldon>物理系毕业生说什么呢
<1-3,Sheldon>of the UC Berkeley physics department?

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,650
<1-3,Sheldon>我点的餐要配薯条
<1-3,Sheldon>I'll have fries with that.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,570
<1-3,Sheldon>因为他们接受的教育不足以
<1-3,Sheldon>Because his education hasn't prepared him

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,850
<1-3,Sheldon>让他们在科学领域找到工作
<1-3,Sheldon>for a career in the sciences.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,890
<1-4,Penny>等学生们冲过来打你们时
<1-4,Penny>You know, when they chase you out of there,

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,300
<1-4,Penny>你只要跑得比谢尔顿快就没事了
<1-4,Penny>you only have to run faster than Sheldon.

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,120
<1-5,Amy>出发都做好准备了吗
<1-5,Amy>Are you all set for your trip?

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,330
<1-6,Sheldon>应该吧
<1-6,Sheldon>Yeah, I think so.

15
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,530
<1-6,Sheldon>我重新帮共所包补了货
<1-6,Sheldon>I just restocked the old PRK.

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,480
<1-6,Sheldon>什么"共所包"
<1-6,Sheldon>"P.R.K"?

<1-8,Leonard>in new and strange places.

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,030
<1-9,Sheldon>带着个背包放自己的厕纸和干洗手液
<1-9,Sheldon>I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack

21
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,060
<1-9,Sheldon>有什么值得奇怪的啊
<1-9,Sheldon>with your own toilet paper and Purell.

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,690
<1-10,Leonard>接着说
<1-10,Leonard>Keep going.

23

<1-11,Sheldon>Um, noise-cancelling headphones.

25
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,230
<1-11,Sheldon>防狼警笛
<1-11,Sheldon>Oh, danger whistle.

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,820
<1-11,Sheldon>防狼喷雾
<1-11,Sheldon>pepper spray.

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,000
<1-11,Sheldon>多语言版"已占用"的牌子
<1-11,Sheldon>Ooh, a multi-language "Occupied" sign.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,930
<1-11,Sheldon>我看看
<1-11,Sheldon>Uh, let's see.

29
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,380
<1-11,Sheldon>还有马桶坐垫纸  鞋套
<1-11,Sheldon>We have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes,

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,420
<1-11,Sheldon>不是什么变态之类的
<1-11,Sheldon>isn't some kind of weirdo.

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,580
<1-12,Penny>你还担心伯克利分校会有姑娘
<1-12,Penny>You still worried some Berkeley girl

35
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,260
<1-12,Penny>把他抢走吗
<1-12,Penny>is gonna steal him away?

36
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,440
<1-13,Amy>当然  不然你觉得他的防狼警笛是谁给的
<1-13,Amy>Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,620
<2-1,Sheldon>你要玩我发明的物理学车上游戏吗
<2-1,Sheldon>Would you like to play a physics car game I invented

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,860
<2-1,Sheldon>名字叫"我是没用间谍"
<2-1,Sheldon>called "I Can't Spy"?

45
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,030
<2-1,Sheldon>保留了"我是小间谍"紧张刺激的部分
<2-1,Sheldon>It's all the nail-biting tension of "I Spy"

46
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,370
<2-1,Sheldon>但是加入了有趣的亚原子粒子
<2-1,Sheldon>but the added fun of subatomic particles

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,280
<2-1,Sheldon>与儿童玩的车上游戏  出题者选定一件看到的事物
<2-1,Sheldon>说出指定对白  并提示该事物首字母给对方猜

48
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,280
<2-1,Sheldon>与可见光谱外的光波
<2-1,Sheldon>and waves outside the visible spectrum.

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,620
<2-2,Leonard>如果这游戏有
<2-2,Leonard>If it's half as much fun as

50
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,780
<2-2,Leonard>"1乘10的4次方瓶啤酒在墙上"那么好玩
<2-2,Leonard>"One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall,"

51
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,490
<2-2,Leonard>99瓶啤酒在墙上也是常见车上游戏
<2-2,Leonard>反复唱着歌词  每次往下减一  直到墙上没了

52
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,420
<2-2,Leonard>我就玩
<2-2,Leonard>I'm in.

53
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,360
<2-3,Sheldon>我先开始
<2-3,Sheldon>I'll begin.

54
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,280
<2-3,Sheldon>小间谍我的眼睛不能看到...
<2-3,Sheldon>Uh, I can't spy with my little eye...

55
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,490
<2-3,Sheldon>某个直接穿过我们的东西
<2-3,Sheldon>something passing right through us.

56
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,560
<2-4,Leonard>我刚才喝的大豆星冰乐
<2-4,Leonard>That soy Frappuccino I had.

57
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,220
<2-5,Sheldon>还能不能好好玩游戏了
<2-5,Sheldon>Will you please play the game?

58
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,700
<2-2,Leonard>小间谍我的眼睛不能看到...
<2-2,Leonard>I can't spy with my little eye

59
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,750
<2-3,Sheldon>某个直接穿过我们的东西
<2-3,Sheldon>something passing right through us.

60
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,910
<2-6,Leonard>我不知道啊
<2-6,Leonard>I don't know, um...

61
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,280
<2-6,Leonard>如果每秒有650亿太阳中微子
<2-6,Leonard>If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,770
<2-6,Leonard>通过每平方厘米的区域
<2-6,Leonard>through a square centimeter every second,

63
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,670
<2-6,Leonard>按照我们这车的表面积来算
<2-6,Leonard>given the surface area of this car is

64
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,600
<2-6,Leonard>也就大概6万平方厘米吧
<2-6,Leonard>about 60,000 square centimeters,

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,660
<2-6,Leonard>所以通过的太阳中微子大概有3900兆那么多吗
<2-6,Leonard>that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?

66
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,470
<2-7,Sheldon>我不想玩了
<2-7,Sheldon>I don't want to play anymore.

67
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,620
<2-8,Leonard>我们好久没有一起自驾游了
<2-8,Leonard>We haven't been on a road trip in a while.

68
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,470
<2-8,Leonard>还挺好玩的
<2-8,Leonard>This is fun.

69
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,690
<2-9,Sheldon>知道你赢了好吗
<2-9,Sheldon>We get it-- you won the game.

70
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,190
<2-9,Sheldon>不用这么臭显摆吧
<2-9,Sheldon>Stop bragging.

71
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,900
<2-10,Leonard>不是啦  我们一起写了篇论文
<2-10,Leonard>No, listen, we wrote a paper together.

72
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,730
<2-10,Leonard>现在还要一起去大学做论文的演讲
<2-10,Leonard>Now we get to go to a university and talk about it?

73
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,790
<2-10,Leonard>这蛮酷的不是吗
<2-10,Leonard>That's pretty cool.

74
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,970
<2-11,Sheldon>我想是吧
<2-11,Sheldon>I suppose it is.

75
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,430
<2-11,Sheldon>其实  如果你想要放点音乐来庆祝一下
<2-11,Sheldon>In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music,

76
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,290
<2-11,Sheldon>我不会介意哦
<2-11,Sheldon>I'd be okay with that.

77
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,980
<2-11,Sheldon>虾米
<2-11,Sheldon>What...?

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,770
<2-12,Leonard>这趟自驾游要疯狂啦
<2-12,Leonard>This road trip just got crazy.

79
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,120
<2-13,Sheldon>放那放克乐吧  白人男孩
<2-13,Sheldon>Play that funky music, white boy.

81
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,010
<2-14,Leonard>我真没想到你知道这个哏
<2-14,Leonard>I'm surprised you know that reference.

82
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,750
<2-15,Sheldon>什么哏
<2-15,Sheldon>What reference?

83
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,270
<3-1,Bernadette>我把所有要卖的东西上都贴了贴纸
<3-1,Bernadette>So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.

84
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,520
<3-1,Bernadette>大家帮忙搬出去到车道上就行了
<3-1,Bernadette>We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.

85
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,050
<3-2,Amy>能让我来负责价格吗
<3-2,Amy>Can I be in charge of pricing?

86
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,350
<3-2,Amy>我这辈子去过无数车库拍卖
<3-2,Amy>I've been going to garage sales my whole life.

87
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,140
<3-2,Amy>你们相信这条连裤袜我只花了5分钱就买到吗
<3-2,Amy>Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?

88
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,240
<3-3,Howard>行  艾米负责价钱
<3-3,Howard>All right, Amy's in charge of pricing

89
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,390
<3-3,Howard>以及当75岁老人
<3-3,Howard>and being 75.

90
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,080
<3-4,Raj>佩妮  能帮忙搭把手吗
<3-4,Raj>Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?

91
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,840
<3-4,Raj>行
<3-4,Raj>Sure.

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,450
<3-5,Penny>我小时候家里也有这个
<3-5,Penny>Aw, we had one of these growing up.

93
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,010
<3-5,Penny>我以前天天玩
<3-5,Penny>I used to play all the time.

94
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,220
<3-6,Raj>是吗  我也爱打乒乓球
<3-6,Raj>Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.

95
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,550
<3-7,Penny>我说的是啤酒乒乓[饮酒游戏]
<3-7,Penny>Oh, I meant beer pong.

96
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,070
<3-8,Amy>我家也有球桌
<3-8,Amy>I had a table, too,

97
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,620
<3-8,Amy>可是我以前没有朋友
<3-8,Amy>but I didn't have any friends,

98
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,980
<3-8,Amy>所以我只能一直发球
<3-8,Amy>so all I did was serve.

99
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,320
<3-9,Bernadette>你可以半边桌不要平放下来  跟桌面对打啊
<3-9,Bernadette>You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,060
<3-10,Amy>如果当年我有朋友  或许就会有人教我这事
<3-10,Amy>And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.

101
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,820
<3-10,Amy>抱歉
<3-10,Amy>Excuse me.

102
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,450
<3-11,Howard>为什么这上面会有要卖的标签
<3-11,Howard>Why is there a sticker on this?

103
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,710
<3-11,Howard>这是我的《神秘博士》塔迪斯
<3-11,Howard>It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who.

104
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,710
<3-11,Howard>《神秘博士》中的电话亭外观时光机
<3-11,Howard>内部空间比外面大许多

105
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,860
<3-11,Howard>我本来准备把它移进家里的
<3-11,Howard>I was planning on moving it in the house.

106
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,150
<3-12,Bernadette>你的话已经回答了你的问题
<3-12,Bernadette>I think you just answered your own question.

107
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,510
<3-13,Howard>干嘛这样  说不定某天它价格会翻倍
<3-13,Howard>Come on, one day, this may double in value

108
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,270
<3-13,Howard>能达到我当时买价的一半
<3-13,Howard>and be worth half what I paid for it.

109
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,840
<3-14,Bernadette>亲爱的  我们的事情还很多
<3-14,Bernadette>Sweetie, we have a lot to do.

110
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,010
<3-14,Bernadette>我们不需要现在就决定这个
<3-14,Bernadette>We don't need to decide this right now.

111
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,760
<3-15,Howard>只要你能有一颗包容的心  我没意见
<3-15,Howard>Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind.

112
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,840
<3-16,Bernadette>当然啦
<3-16,Bernadette>Of course.

113
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,600
<3-16,Bernadette>* 放那放克乐  白人男孩 *
<3-16,Bernadette>* Play that funky music, white boy *

114
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,050
<3-16,Bernadette>* 放对那放克乐 *
<3-16,Bernadette>* Play that funky music right *

115
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,610
<3-16,Bernadette>* 放那放克乐  白人男孩 *
<3-16,Bernadette>* Play that funky music, white boy *

116
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,520
<4-1,Sheldon>所以他们要求
<4-1,Sheldon>So... they're requesting

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,920
<4-1,Sheldon>那个白人男孩放那放克乐对吧
<4-1,Sheldon>that the white boy play the funky music, yes?

118
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,880
<4-2,Leonard>是啊
<4-2,Leonard>Yes.

119
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,100
<4-3,Sheldon>而我们现在在听的歌
<4-3,Sheldon>And this music we're listening to right now

120
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,960
<4-3,Sheldon>就是放克乐  对吧
<4-3,Sheldon>is funky as well?

121
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,880
<4-4,Leonard>是啊
<4-4,Leonard>Sure.

122
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,860
<4-5,Sheldon>我问你个问题
<4-5,Sheldon>Let me ask you this.

123
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,170
<4-5,Sheldon>你觉得这首歌
<4-5,Sheldon>Do you think

124
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,010
<4-5,Sheldon>是不是那个白人男孩去放的那首放克乐
<4-5,Sheldon>this song is the music the white boy ultimately play?

125
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,370
<4-6,Leonard>有可能啊
<4-6,Leonard>It could be.

126
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,170
<4-7,Sheldon>所以这就是像是音乐界的罗素悖论
<4-7,Sheldon>So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox,

127
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,840
<4-7,Sheldon>所有不包含自身的集合
<4-7,Sheldon>the question of whether the set of all sets

128
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,000
<4-7,Sheldon>本身是否属于该集合
<4-7,Sheldon>that don't contain themselves as members contains itself?

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,960
<4-8,Leonard>-没错  -这样的话
<4-8,Leonard>- Exactly. - Well...

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
<4-9,Sheldon>我讨厌这首歌
<4-9,Sheldon>then I hate it.

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,020
<4-9,Sheldon>音乐就应该是纯娱乐
<4-9,Sheldon>Music should just be fun.

132
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,060
<4-10,Leonard>基本没浪费时间
<4-10,Leonard>Making great time.

133
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,670
<4-10,Leonard>我们会很早到那里
<4-10,Leonard>Gonna be there pretty early.

134
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,850
<4-11,Sheldon>我们的酒店房间会准备好了吗
<4-11,Sheldon>Will our hotel room be ready?

135
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,370
<4-12,Leonard>难说
<4-12,Leonard>I doubt it.

136
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,800
<4-13,Sheldon>你不担心如果我们在大堂
<4-13,Sheldon>Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby

137
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,330
<4-13,Sheldon>坐得时间太久
<4-13,Sheldon>for a long period of time

138
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,040
<4-13,Sheldon>会引起酒店侦探的注意吗
<4-13,Sheldon>might attract the attention of the hotel detective?

139
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,700
<4-14,Leonard>如果真引起注意
<4-14,Leonard>If we do,

140
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,810
<4-14,Leonard>我们就叫他"好狗不挡路  滚"
<4-14,Leonard>we'll just tell him to "hit the bricks, see?"

141
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,740
<4-15,Sheldon>感觉有点太霸气了  不过行吧
<4-15,Sheldon>Seems a little confrontational, but all right.

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,030
<4-15,Sheldon>我们现在这里离天行者牧场不远
<4-15,Sheldon>You know, we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch.

143
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,700
<4-15,Sheldon>乔治·卢卡斯花费一亿美元买下的
<4-15,Sheldon>16平方公里地  用作电影拍摄与工作场所

144
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,110
<4-16,Leonard>这倒是
<4-16,Leonard>Oh, that's true.

145
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,020
<4-16,Leonard>我们又不能进去
<4-16,Leonard>It's not like we can get in there.

146
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,450
<4-17,Sheldon>为什么不能
<4-17,Sheldon>Why not?

147
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,810
<4-18,Leonard>乔治·卢卡斯把他的总部
<4-18,Leonard>I-I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters

148
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,840
<4-19,Sheldon>设在荒郊野外
<4-19,Sheldon>in the middle of nowhere

149
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,440
<4-18,Leonard>就是为了不想有人乱入
<4-18,Leonard>because he wanted people dropping in.

150
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,090
<4-19,Sheldon>星战里尤达大师的沼泽也是在荒郊野外啊
<4-19,Sheldon>Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere.

151
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,540
<4-19,Sheldon>星战里  天行者的故乡也是荒郊野外啊
<4-19,Sheldon>Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere.

152
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,540
<4-19,Sheldon>霍思星  也是偏僻到不行啊
<4-19,Sheldon>Hoth was in the middle of nowhere.

153
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,430
<4-19,Sheldon>这是暗号  莱纳德
<4-19,Sheldon>That's code, Leonard.

154
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,570
<4-19,Sheldon>他希望我们乱入
<4-19,Sheldon>He wants us to drop in.

155
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,410
<4-20,Leonard>我们是还有多余时间
<4-20,Leonard>We do have time.

156
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,430
<4-20,Leonard>我们可以开车经过看一下
<4-20,Leonard>I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.

157
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,930
<4-21,Sheldon>太好了
<4-21,Sheldon>Yes! Oh...

158
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,250
<4-21,Sheldon>我好兴奋
<4-21,Sheldon>I'm so excited.

159
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,490
<4-21,Sheldon>藏都藏不住
<4-21,Sheldon>And I just can't hide it.

160
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,470
<4-22,Leonard>"我就快要失控  而我喜欢这感觉"
<4-22,Leonard>"I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it."

161
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,300
<4-21,Sheldon>以上几句全是来自指针姐妹合唱团歌曲
<4-21,Sheldon>《I'm so excited》的歌词

162
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,300
<4-23,Sheldon>你在说什么啊
<4-23,Sheldon>What are you talking about?

163
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,650
<5-1,Penny>你们两个打算什么时候搬进来呢
<5-1,Penny>So when do you guys think you're gonna move in?

164
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,460
<5-2,Howard>我们还在考虑要装修哪里
<5-2,Howard>We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.

165
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,340
<5-3,Bernadette>要在"有品位现代化"
<5-3,Bernadette>It's tricky finding the right balance between

166
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,360
<5-3,Bernadette>与"犹太老妈俗气破烂"之间找平衡挺有难度
<5-3,Bernadette>"Tasteful modern" and "Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest."

167
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,700
<5-4,Amy>你们决定好怎么处置塔迪斯了吗
<5-4,Amy>Have you made a decision about the TARDIS?

168
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,130
<5-4,Amy>换个名字我应该能卖掉
<5-4,Amy>I think I can sell it if we call it,

169
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,660
<5-4,Amy>叫"大号英式移动公厕"
<5-4,Amy>"Big British Porta-Potty."

170
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,050
<5-5,Howard>我们不卖  这是我的东西
<5-5,Howard>We're not selling it-- it's mine.

171
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,540
<5-6,Bernadette>你不能随便做决定
<5-6,Bernadette>You can't just decide.

172
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,250
<5-6,Bernadette>不然我们比腕力定胜负吧
<5-6,Bernadette>How about I arm-wrestle you?

173
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,400
<5-6,Bernadette>这不公平啊
<5-6,Bernadette>That's not fair.

174
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,060
<5-7,Howard>这就跟我用性感裤子比赛虐你一样
<5-7,Howard>It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.

175
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,650
<5-8,Raj>你们可以打乒乓定输赢啊
<5-8,Raj>You could play Ping-Pong for it.

176
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,860
<5-9,Howard>这我可以接受
<5-9,Howard>I would do that.

177
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,710
<5-10,Bernadette>这怎么就公平了
<5-10,Bernadette>How is that fair?

178
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,910
<5-10,Bernadette>你从小家里就有球桌
<5-10,Bernadette>You grew up with a table.

179
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,430
<5-11,Howard>但我几乎都是用来当做
<5-11,Howard>Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield

180
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,340
<5-11,Howard>变形金刚与霹雳猫之间的战场  让他们争夺
<5-11,Howard>in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats

181
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,530
<5-11,Howard>我在树林捡来的胸罩的控制权
<5-11,Howard>for control of a bra I had found in the woods.

182
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,570
<5-12,Penny>伯纳黛特  看在莱纳德逼我
<5-12,Penny>Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who

183
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,950
<5-12,Penny>看过的所有《神秘博士》的仇
<5-12,Penny>Leonard has made me sit through,

184
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,270
<5-12,Penny>我愿意为你出战
<5-12,Penny>I will play on your behalf

185
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,340
<5-12,Penny>把塔迪斯送回加利弗雷去
<5-12,Penny>and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey,

186
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,850
<5-12,Penny>我真恨我还知道了它母星叫什么
<5-12,Penny>where I hate that I know it belongs.

187
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,330
<5-13,Bernadette>行  佩妮替我出赛
<5-13,Bernadette>Yes, Penny plays for me.

188
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,630
<5-14,Howard>这不公平啊  她有上半身肌肉
<5-14,Howard>That's not fair-- she has upper body muscles.

189
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,400
<5-15,Raj>兄弟  我可是三届
<5-15,Raj>Dude, three-time Sanskriti School

<5-17,Amy>Ooh, you just chose champions.

193
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,940
<5-17,Amy>感觉像是在重演旧时德国的
<5-17,Amy>It's like we're reenacting the ancient German practice

194
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,800
<5-17,Amy>-决斗裁判法  -是啊  就像是
<5-17,Amy>- of trial by combat. - Yeah, it's also like

195
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,310
<5-18,Penny>《权利的游戏》里魔山大战红毒蛇那样
<5-18,Penny>when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.

196
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,950
<5-19,Bernadette>也是莱纳德逼你看的吧

<5-20,Penny>里面有龙  还有人做爱
<5-20,Penny>It's got dragons and people doing it.

199
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,640
<5-21,Howard>就这么定了
<5-21,Howard>So it's settled.

200
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,090
<5-21,Howard>《神秘博士》的塔迪斯的去留
<5-21,Howard>The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided

201
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,590
<5-21,Howard>将由在霹雳猫大战变形金刚的旧战场上
<5-21,Howard>by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield

202
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,880
<5-21,Howard>由一场受《权利的游戏》启发的死斗来决定
<5-21,Howard>of ThunderCats versus Transformers.

203
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,090
<5-22,Amy>如果当年那个胸罩还在  我出5分钱跟你买
<5-22,Amy>If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it.

204

<6-1,Sheldon>到了
<6-1,Sheldon>There it is.

205
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,010
<6-1,Sheldon>只有个闸门
<6-1,Sheldon>It's just a gate.

206
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,710
<6-1,Sheldon>在路中间
<6-1,Sheldon>On a road.

207
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,850
<6-2,Leonard>而且一点也不难找
<6-2,Leonard>Wasn't even that hard to find.

208
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,530
<6-3,Sheldon>这也太赞了

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,690
<6-5,Sheldon>我想进去
<6-5,Sheldon>I want to go in.

213

<6-6,Leonard>我也想进去  不过他们肯定不让进
<6-6,Leonard>Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.

214
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,080
<6-7,Sheldon>你泡到佩妮靠的是这态度吗
<6-7,Sheldon>Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?

215
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,770
<6-8,Leonard>不是啊  可是我也没有三年时间
<6-8,Leonard>No, but I don't have three years

216
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,510
<6-8,Leonard>可以让那个闸门同情我啊
<6-8,Leonard>to make that gate feel sorry for me.

217
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,130
<6-9,Sheldon>那边有个对讲机
<6-9,Sheldon>Uh, there's a speaker box.

<6-10,Leonard>What do we have to lose?

222
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,330
<6-10,Leonard>我有点紧张
<6-10,Leonard>I'm a little nervous.

223
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,580
<6-11,Sheldon>克服它
<6-11,Sheldon>Well, get over it.

224
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,480
<6-11,Sheldon>这种情况最需要的就是自信
<6-11,Sheldon>Confidence is key in these situations.

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,400
<6-12,Leonard>是的

234
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,440
<6-15,Leonard>不过我们的确是有个背包
<6-15,Leonard>although we do have a backpack

235
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,920
<6-15,Leonard>里面装满了你不会想看的东西
<6-15,Leonard>that you really don't want to look in.

236
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,490
<6-16,Sheldon>你要搞砸了
<6-16,Sheldon>You're blowing it.

237

242
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,440
<7-1,Sheldon>好了  我们过了第一关
<7-1,Sheldon>All right, we've defeated the first challenge.

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,900
<7-1,Sheldon>我们现在得硬起来  对抗这个
<7-1,Sheldon>Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster

244
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,780
<7-1,Sheldon>镇守大门的怪兽
<7-1,Sheldon>who defends the gate.

245
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,110
<7-2,Leonard>我们是要避开一个保安
<7-2,Leonard>We're trying to get past a security guard,

246
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,300
<7-2,Leonard>又不是拯救塞尔达[游戏名]
<7-2,Leonard>not rescue Zelda.

247
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,060
<7-3,Sheldon>我看是你那吊儿郎当的念头才需要拯救吧
<7-3,Sheldon>I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy,

248
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,080
<7-3,Sheldon>不过现在先解决这件事
<7-3,Sheldon>but one quest at a time.

249
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,050
<7-3,Sheldon>所以你的计划是什么
<7-3,Sheldon>So what's the plan?

250
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,020
<7-4,Leonard>我决定对那个保安实话实说
<7-4,Leonard>Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.

251
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,310
<7-5,Sheldon>说实话我们永远进不去
<7-5,Sheldon>Honesty will never get us in.

252
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,980
<7-6,Leonard>那你的计划是什么
<7-6,Leonard>Well, what's your plan?

253
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,170
<7-7,Sheldon>我的计划是预估一下
<7-7,Sheldon>All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption

254
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,140
<7-7,Sheldon>里面有医疗室的可能性
<7-7,Sheldon>that they have a nurse's office

255
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,860
<7-7,Sheldon>以及你同意被小捅一刀的自愿度
<7-7,Sheldon>and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.

256
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,520
<7-8,Security Guard>你们要去拜访谁
<7-8,Security Guard>Who are you here to see?

257
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,290
<7-9,Leonard>我还是实话实说吧
<7-9,Leonard>Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth.

258
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,290
<7-10,Sheldon>真是要了亲命了
<7-10,Sheldon>Oh, you are killing me.

259
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,570
<7-11,Leonard>我们没有预约
<7-11,Leonard>We don't have an appointment.

260
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,710
<7-11,Leonard>我们是卢卡斯先生的忠实粉丝
<7-11,Leonard>We-we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work,

261
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,950
<7-11,Leonard>我们只想来碰碰运气
<7-11,Leonard>and we thought we'd take a shot

262
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,140
<7-11,Leonard>您能不能让我们进去看看
<7-11,Leonard>and see if we could get in and look around.

263
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,590
<7-12,Security Guard>抱歉各位  这种人我们见多了
<7-12,Security Guard>Sorry, guys, we get this a lot.

264
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,700
<7-12,Security Guard>我不能让你们进去
<7-12,Security Guard>Can't let you in.

265
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,600
<7-13,Sheldon>如果我告诉你我就是尤达的配音呢
<7-13,Sheldon>What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda?

266
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,620
<7-13,Sheldon>我必须进去参加一场配音会议
<7-13,Sheldon>A recording session I must attend.

267
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,550
<7-14,Leonard>对不起  别理他
<7-14,Leonard>I'm sorry, don't listen to him.

268
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,070
<7-14,Leonard>我们其实是物理学家
<7-14,Leonard>We're actually physicists.

269
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,880
<7-14,Leonard>我们一会儿要去伯克利分校上课
<7-14,Leonard>We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today.

270
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,210
<7-14,Leonard>我们只是想消磨一下时间
<7-14,Leonard>We just... we had some time to kill.

271
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,100
<7-15,Security Guard>我说  你们看上去也是体面的人
<7-15,Security Guard>Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys.

272
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,430
<7-15,Security Guard>我不能让你们进去
<7-15,Security Guard>I can't let you in,

273
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,630
<7-15,Security Guard>但我可以送你们一些帽子和纪念T恤
<7-15,Security Guard>but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.

274
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,530
<7-15,Security Guard>非常感谢你
<7-15,Security Guard>Thank you so much.

275
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,420
<7-16,Leonard>看到没
<7-16,Leonard>See?

276
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,870
<7-16,Leonard>诚实才是最宝贵的...
<7-16,Leonard>Maybe honesty is the best...

277
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,180
<7-16,Leonard>你在干什么呢
<7-16,Leonard>What are you doing?

278
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,610
<7-17,Sheldon>当然是挣脱那束缚我的枷锁
<7-17,Sheldon>Shedding the yoke of my oppressors,

279
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,150
<7-17,Sheldon>你这个无知  可悲的小矮子
<7-17,Sheldon>you blind, sad little man.

280
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,560
<7-18,Security Guard>不许动
<7-18,Security Guard>Don't move!

<7-18,Security Guard>代号AA23  AA23
<7-18,Security Guard>Code A-A-23, A-A-23.

<7-19,Voice>收到
<7-19,Voice>Copy.

284
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,400
<7-20,Sheldon>我看到牧场了  莱纳德
<7-20,Sheldon>I can see the ranch, Leonard!

285
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,900
<7-20,Sheldon>充满了乡村气息  真美啊
<7-20,Sheldon>Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely.

286
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,930
<7-20,Sheldon>我想拍个照片  可是好多人在追我
<7-20,Sheldon>I'd take a picture, but people are chasing me.

287
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,600
<7-20,Sheldon>我就要成功了
<7-20,Sheldon>I'm gonna make it...!

288
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,900
<7-20,Sheldon>我就要成功了
<7-20,Sheldon>I'm gonna make it!

289
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,550
<7-20,Sheldon>他们有脉冲电击枪  可他们肯定不敢...
<7-20,Sheldon>They have Tasers, but they wouldn't dare use...

290
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,740
<7-20,Sheldon>拉杰  加油
<7-20,Sheldon>Come on, Raj.

291
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,560
<8-1,Howard>你是乒乓届的金刚
<8-1,Howard>You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong.

292
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,910
<8-1,Howard>你是桌球届的霸王
<8-1,Howard>You are the menace of table tennis.

293
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,230
<8-1,Howard>赶紧灭了她  我想不出第三句了
<8-1,Howard>Put her away, 'cause I don't have a third one.

294
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,460
<8-1,Howard>太好了
<8-1,Howard>Yes!

295
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,260
<8-2,Amy>拉杰8分  佩妮4分
<8-2,Amy>Rajesh eight, Penny four.

296
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,030
<8-3,Penny>抱歉  他实在是太强了
<8-3,Penny>Sorry, he's really good.

297
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,410
<8-4,Bernadette>拉杰
<8-4,Bernadette>Hey, Raj.

298
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,900
<8-4,Bernadette>如果霍华德不能留着塔迪斯
<8-4,Bernadette>if Howard can't keep the TARDIS,

299
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,630
<8-4,Bernadette>把它放在你家会不会很酷啊
<8-4,Bernadette>how great would it look at your place?

300
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,290
<8-5,Raj>什么
<8-5,Raj>What?

301
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,470
<8-6,Howard>对啊  什么
<8-6,Howard>Yeah, what?

302
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,730
<8-7,Bernadette>我对《神秘博士》了解不多
<8-7,Bernadette>I don't know much about Doctor Who,

303
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,270
<8-7,Bernadette>但是如果你把它放在大门外面
<8-7,Bernadette>but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door

304
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,840
<8-7,Bernadette>再把后门跟你家大门打开
<8-7,Bernadette>and open up the back,

305
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,070
<8-7,Bernadette>你的整个公寓就仿佛
<8-7,Bernadette>it would be like your entire apartment was

306
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,430
<8-7,Bernadette>变成了塔迪斯的内部
<8-7,Bernadette>the inside of the TARDIS,

307
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,700
<8-7,Bernadette>很酷对不对
<8-7,Bernadette>which is pretty cool

308
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,510
<8-7,Bernadette>因为在电视剧里  时间机器的内部
<8-7,Bernadette>'cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS

309
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,610
<8-7,Bernadette>的确比外观大得多
<8-7,Bernadette>is bigger than the outside.

310
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,350
<8-7,Bernadette>但话说回来  我对《神秘博士》了解并不多
<8-7,Bernadette>But then again, I don't know much about Doctor Who.

311
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,140
<8-7,Bernadette>别听她的
<8-7,Bernadette>Don't listen to her.

312
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,120
<8-8,Howard>我俩交情似海深  兄弟如手足啊
<8-8,Howard>You and I go way back-- we're like brothers.

313
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,880
<8-9,Raj>没错  没错
<8-9,Raj>We are. We are.

314
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,070
<8-9,Raj>哎呀  人家发球太烂了
<8-9,Raj>Oh, no! What a terrible serve!

315
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,610
<8-9,Raj>抱歉了  手足
<8-9,Raj>Sorry, brother.

316
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,940
<8-10,Amy>-8比5  -这太无耻了
<8-10,Amy>- Eight-five. - This is ridiculous.

317
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,060
<8-11,Howard>我要换选手
<8-11,Howard>I want a new champion.

318
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,690
<8-11,Howard>艾米  你说你会发球是真的吗
<8-11,Howard>Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?

319
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,530
<8-12,Amy>那已经是很久以前的事了
<8-12,Amy>Uh, it-it's been a long time.

320
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,100
<8-12,Amy>我也没把握
<8-12,Amy>I don't know.

321
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,300
<8-12,Amy>我的技术可能都荒废了
<8-12,Amy>I'm probably pretty rusty.

322
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,890
<8-14,Howard>她才是我的新选手
<8-14,Howard>She's my champion!

323
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,060
<8-15,Bernadette>如果你可以换  我也可以
<8-15,Bernadette>Well, if you can switch champions, so can I.

324
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,550
<8-15,Bernadette>-我选拉杰  -喂
<8-15,Bernadette>- I want Raj. - Hey.

325
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,060
<8-17,Bernadette>拜托  好像你介意似的
<8-17,Bernadette>Oh, come on, like you even care.

326
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,480
<8-18,Penny>我是介意啊
<8-18,Penny>I care!

327
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,330
<8-18,Penny>等等  我才不介意呢  加油吧  拉杰
<8-18,Penny>Oh, wait, no, I don't. Good luck, Raj.

328
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,560
<8-19,Howard>我以为我们的友情对你来说更重要呢
<8-19,Howard>You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.

329
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,780
<8-20,Raj>我也这么以为
<8-20,Raj>So did I.

330
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,960
<9-1,Sheldon>你觉得他们会通报警察吗
<9-1,Sheldon>Do you think they're gonna call the police?

331
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,270
<9-1,Sheldon>我不知道
<9-1,Sheldon>I don't know.

332
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,520
<9-2,Leonard>也许他们会通报帝国警察
<9-2,Leonard>Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us

333
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,420
<9-2,Leonard>然后把我们关进死星里的小牢房吧
<9-2,Leonard>to a holding cell on the Death Star.

334
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,290
<9-3,Sheldon>帝国警察才不会屈尊来处理这种事呢
<9-3,Sheldon>Oh, I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer.

335
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,380
<9-3,Sheldon>暴风部队真正的职能是...
<9-3,Sheldon>Stormtroopers are really the ones who...

336
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,510
<9-4,Leonard>闭嘴吧你
<9-4,Leonard>Oh, shut up.

337
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,780
<9-4,Leonard>他说得对
<9-4,Leonard>He's right.

338
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,920
<9-5,Nerdy Guy>暴风部队其实兼负了
<9-5,Nerdy Guy>Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function

339
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,710
<9-5,Nerdy Guy>步兵和宪兵两种职能
<9-5,Nerdy Guy>of infantry and military police.

340
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,290
<9-6,Leonard>我这人一般挺和善的
<9-6,Leonard>Uh-huh, I'm normally very nice,

341
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,760
<9-6,Leonard>但你丫也给我闭嘴吧
<9-6,Leonard>but you shut up, too.

342
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,750
<9-6,Leonard>话说
<9-6,Leonard>So...

343
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,850
<9-7,Sheldon>你是为什么进来的
<9-7,Sheldon>what are you in for?

344
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,220
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>我只是想见见卢卡斯先生  向他致谢
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you.

345
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,600
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>这电影在我成长之路上意义重大
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life.

346
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,570
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>我这人在哪里都不合群
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>I never really fit in anywhere.

347
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,890
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>直到我发现了他创造的世界
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>Till I discovered the worlds he created

348
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,370
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>才终于找到了属于我的地方
<9-8,Nerdy Guy>and finally found a place where I belong.

349
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,290
<9-9,Sheldon>但你怎么会在这里呢
<9-9,Sheldon>But why are you here?

350
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,510
<9-10,Nerdy Guy>我...我翻过了栏杆
<9-10,Nerdy Guy>Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence,

351
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,700
<9-10,Nerdy Guy>结果他们抓到我在雕像馆
<9-10,Nerdy Guy>and they caught me in the sculpture gallery

352
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,710
<9-10,Nerdy Guy>和一个楚巴卡雕塑亲热
<9-10,Nerdy Guy>making out with a Chewbacca statue.

353
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,420
<9-11,Sheldon>失陪一下
<9-11,Sheldon>Excuse me.

354
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,510
<9-11,Sheldon>莱纳德
<9-11,Sheldon>Leonard,

355
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,310
<9-11,Sheldon>里面还有雕像馆呢
<9-11,Sheldon>they have a sculpture gallery.

356
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,860
<9-12,Security Guard>我跟我的上司汇报了
<9-12,Security Guard>All right, I talked to my supervisor,

357
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,840
<9-12,Security Guard>我们这次只给你们一个警告
<9-12,Security Guard>and we're gonna let you go with a warning.

358
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,030
<9-12,Security Guard>不过如果你们还敢来
<9-12,Security Guard>But if you ever come back,

359
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,800
<9-12,Security Guard>我们会报警并起诉你
<9-12,Security Guard>we will call the police and press charges.

360
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,770
<9-13,Leonard>我们明白
<9-13,Leonard>We understand.

361
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,050
<9-13,Leonard>非常感谢

<9-14,Nerdy Guy>Uh, what about me?

363
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,240
<9-15,Security Guard>你哪里也不能去  接吻狂魔
<9-15,Security Guard>No, you're not going anywhere, kissy face.

364

<9-15,Security Guard>来吧
<9-15,Security Guard>Let's go.

<9-15,Security Guard>我要给你们拍照贴在大门外
<9-15,Security Guard>I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.

366
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,530
<9-16,Sheldon>关于照片我有个问题
<9-16,Sheldon>Uh, one question about that picture.

367
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,970
<9-16,Sheldon>我能跟乔治·卢卡斯一起拍吗
<9-16,Sheldon>Can it be with George Lucas?

368
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,880
<9-16,Sheldon>好凶巴巴哦
<9-16,Sheldon>Ooh, grumpy you are.

369
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,470
<10-1,Howard>好了  现在是最终对决
<10-1,Howard>Okay, this is the match that decides it all.

370
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,680
<10-1,Howard>先得十一分的人赢
<10-1,Howard>First to 11 wins.

371
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,780
<10-1,Howard>每五分换发一次
<10-1,Howard>Serve switches every five points.

372
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,530
<10-1,Howard>跟你说一声  本来一开始
<10-1,Howard>And just so you know, when this started,

373
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,090
<10-1,Howard>我只是想把塔迪斯放在房子不碍事的角落
<10-1,Howard>I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house,

374
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,330
<10-1,Howard>可是我现在生气了
<10-1,Howard>but I've since turned mean,

375
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,150
<10-1,Howard>所以我会把它摆在客厅的最中间
<10-1,Howard>and now it's going right in the middle of the living room

376
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,250
<10-1,Howard>或者放在转台上  并挂着"咬我啊"
<10-1,Howard>on a rotating platform with a sign that says "Suck it".

377
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,670
<10-1,Howard>比赛开始
<10-1,Howard>Game on.

378
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,000

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,830
<10-2,Bernadette>拉杰会赢
<10-2,Bernadette>Raj is gonna win.

380
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,290
<10-2,Bernadette>是不是  拉杰
<10-2,Bernadette>Isn't that right, Raj?

381
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,700
<10-3,Raj>可是她发球发得不错
<10-3,Raj>Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.

382
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,260
<10-4,Bernadette>给点力啊  攻敌先攻心
<10-4,Bernadette>Come on, get in her head.

383
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,980
<10-4,Bernadette>气势上先压倒她
<10-4,Bernadette>Be intimidating.

384
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,020
<10-5,Raj>好吧
<10-5,Raj>Okay, uh...

385

<10-17,Amy>Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.

417
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,790
<10-18,Howard>的确是  不过现在回到你发球了
<10-18,Howard>It was, and now the serve is back to you,

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,710
<10-18,Howard>游戏要结束了
<10-18,Howard>and the game is over.

419
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,730
<10-19,Bernadette>你知道吗  艾米  我
<10-19,Bernadette>You know, Amy, I, uh...

420
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,370
<10-19,Bernadette>我一直在想要是塔迪斯在你家
<10-19,Bernadette>can't help but wonder how Sheldon would react

421
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,390
<10-19,Bernadette>谢尔顿会有什么反应
<10-19,Bernadette>if the TARDIS was at your place.

422
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,900
<10-20,Howard>别听她的  快发球
<10-20,Howard>Don't listen to her, just hit the ball.

423
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,530
<10-21,Amy>继续说
<10-21,Amy>Keep talking.

424
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,510
<11-1,Bernadette>如果连这个都不能拐他进你闺房
<11-1,Bernadette>If this doesn't get him into your bedroom,

425
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,610
<11-1,Bernadette>也没有别的可以了
<11-1,Bernadette>nothing will.

426
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,830
<11-1,Bernadette>你还在生我气吗
<11-1,Bernadette>Are you still mad at me?

427
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,130
<12-1,Sheldon>对  我们没赶上演讲  差点被拘捕
<12-1,Sheldon>Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested,

428
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,790
<12-2,Leonard>你还害我跟一个强行把舌头
<12-2,Leonard>and you got me locked in a room with a man

429
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,070
<12-2,Leonard>塞进伍基人玩偶喉咙里的男人关在一起
<12-2,Leonard>who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookie.

430
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,940
<12-3,Sheldon>杯子半空的悲观人儿啊
<12-3,Sheldon>Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.

431
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,940
<12-4,Leonard>杯子是全空的好吗  谢尔顿
<12-4,Leonard>The glass is empty, Sheldon.

432
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,080
<12-4,Leonard>完全是空的
<12-4,Leonard>It's completely empty.

433
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,150
<12-4,Leonard>如果你把那杯子给一个快要渴死的人
<12-4,Leonard>If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst,

434
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,110
<12-4,Leonard>他就死定了  你知道为什么吗
<12-4,Leonard>he would be dead, do you know why?

435
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,720
<12-5,Sheldon>我先问一下  他抽烟吗
<12-5,Sheldon>Before I answer, was he a smoker?

436
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,230
<12-5,Sheldon>我觉得你看待事情的角度不对
<12-5,Sheldon>I think you're looking at this all wrong.

437
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,760
<12-6,Leonard>好吧  那你告诉我我应该怎么看待这件事
<12-6,Leonard>Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.

438
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,270
<12-7,Sheldon>我们不仅到了天行者农场  还进到里面了
<12-7,Sheldon>Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in.

439
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,560
<12-7,Sheldon>我们认识的人里没人做到过
<12-7,Sheldon>And no one we know can say that.

440
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,740
<12-7,Sheldon>而且你不是一直觉得我很烦人吗
<12-7,Sheldon>And for all the times you find me irritating,

441
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,490
<12-7,Sheldon>今天你终于可以有人电击我了
<12-7,Sheldon>today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.

442
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,640
<12-8,Leonard>这部分是不错
<12-8,Leonard>That part was pretty good.

443
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,480
<12-9,Sheldon>是吧
<12-9,Sheldon>See?

444
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,610
<12-10,Leonard>你被电到满地抽抽啊
<12-10,Leonard>You did flop around a lot.

445
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,830
<12-11,Sheldon>这一点我承认
<12-11,Sheldon>I'll take your word for it.

446
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,590
<12-11,Sheldon>我当时正忙着不让自己尿出来
<12-11,Sheldon>I was too busy trying not to defecate.

447
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,410
<12-12,Leonard>话说他们带我们去拘留室的时候
<12-12,Leonard>You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room,

448
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,060
<12-12,Leonard>我看进一扇门
<12-12,Leonard>I looked through a door,

449
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,280
<12-12,Leonard>我很确定我看到了一个展示台
<12-12,Leonard>and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case

450
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,360
<12-12,Leonard>里面装着约柜[圣物]
<12-12,Leonard>with the Ark of the Covenant.

451
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,530
<12-14,Leonard>-太神奇了  -就是啊
<12-14,Leonard>- That's amazing. - I know.

452
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,590
<12-15,Sheldon>我还看到赫特人贾巴骑着摩托车经过呢
<12-15,Sheldon>And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle.

453
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,490
<12-15,Sheldon>不过那时我刚被电过
<12-15,Sheldon>Although that was right after the Tasing,

454
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,470
<12-15,Sheldon>所以我也不确定是真是假
<12-15,Sheldon>so who can say for sure?

455
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,380
<12-16,Leonard>我觉得我们这可以算是一场冒险
<12-16,Leonard>I-I guess this could count as an adventure.

456
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,840
<12-16,Leonard>确实是
<12-16,Leonard>It was.

457
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,590
<12-17,Sheldon>而且虽然他们禁止我们再去
<12-17,Sheldon>And even though we're not allowed back there,

458
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,350
<12-17,Sheldon>但却夺不走我们今天的经历
<12-17,Sheldon>they can never take today away from us.

459
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,540
<12-17,Sheldon>但不包括我的嗅觉
<12-17,Sheldon>Unlike my sense of smell,

460
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,190
<12-17,Sheldon>被电击完到现在还没恢复呢
<12-17,Sheldon>which hasn't returned since the Tasing.

461
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,230
<12-17,Sheldon>不  什么都闻不到
<12-17,Sheldon>No, I got nothing.

462
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,850
<13-1,Sheldon>艾米  戴立克正追着我跑呢
<13-1,Sheldon>Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail!

463
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,990
<13-1,Sheldon>快  我们得回去重设时间线
<13-1,Sheldon>Quick, we need to reset the time circuits.

464
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,740
<13-1,Sheldon>不  我忘拿我的音速起子了
<13-1,Sheldon>Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.

465
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,880
<13-2,Amy>我当时真应该好好考虑
<13-2,Amy>Really should have thought this through.
