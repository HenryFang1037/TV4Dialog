1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,760
<1-2,Leonard>今天是中午的班呀
<1-2,Leonard>You work the lunch shift?

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,590
<1-3,Penny>是啊  我还带了八磅快坏的鲑鱼回来
<1-3,Penny>Yeah. I've got eight pounds of salmon that's about to go bad.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,980
<1-3,Penny>你知道怎么煮吗
<1-3,Penny>Do you know how to cook it?

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,760
<1-4,Leonard>-不知道  -该死
<1-4,Leonard>- Not really.  - Damn it.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,100
<1-5,Penny>早知道就应该拿那些问题鸡肉
<1-5,Penny>Should have liberated the iffy chicken.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,310
<1-5,Penny>你和那个挑剔鬼今晚有啥节目
<1-5,Penny>What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,730
<1-6,Leonard>看蓝光版星球大战
<1-6,Leonard>Star Wars on Blu-ray.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,730
<1-7,Penny>你们不是已经看了N遍了吗
<1-7,Penny>Haven't you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,160
<1-8,Leonard>蓝光版的没有啊
<1-8,Leonard>Not on Blu-ray.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,090
<1-8,Leonard>蓝光的只看了两遍
<1-8,Leonard>Only twice on Blu-ray.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,290
<1-9,Penny>可悲啊  莱纳德
<1-9,Penny>Oh, Leonard.

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,220
<1-10,Leonard>我知道  都是高清惹的祸
<1-10,Leonard>I know, it's high-resolution sadness.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,520
<1-11,Penny>我今晚打算去看一场电影
<1-11,Penny>Well, I'm going to take myself out to a movie tonight.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,680
<1-11,Penny>你想去吗
<1-11,Penny>You want to go?

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,150
<1-12,Leonard>真的吗  我们能去吗
<1-12,Leonard>Really? Do we do that?

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,380
<1-13,Penny>你什么意思
<1-13,Penny>What do you mean?

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,620
<1-14,Leonard>你也知道  自从咱俩分手以后
<1-14,Leonard>You know, we haven't spent time alone together

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,120
<1-14,Leonard>就没单独出去玩过
<1-14,Leonard>since we broke up.

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,370
<1-15,Penny>莱纳德  这又不是约会
<1-15,Penny>Oh, it's not a date, Leonard.

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,120
<1-15,Penny>只是一个男人和一个女人出去玩
<1-15,Penny>It's just a man and a woman hanging out,

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,260
<1-15,Penny>晚上各回各家  各睡各床
<1-15,Penny>not having sex at the end of the night.

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,210
<1-16,Leonard>这是我大多数约会的真实写照
<1-16,Leonard>Sounds like most of my dates.

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,610
<1-17,Sheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach)>老天呐  离我远点  你个怪物
<1-17,Sheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach)>Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!

24
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,240
<1-18,Penny>这是怎么回事
<1-18,Penny>What is that about?

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,110
<1-19,Leonard>他够聪明也够疯狂
<1-19,Leonard>Well, he's smart and crazy enough,

26
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,510
<1-19,Leonard>没准真造了个怪物出来
<1-19,Leonard>he may have actually created a monster.

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,350
<1-20,Sheldon>去  去  快走
<1-20,Sheldon>Shoo, shoo! Be gone!

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,880
<1-21,Leonard>到底是怎么了
<1-21,Leonard>What the hell is going on?

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,290
<1-22,Sheldon>窗户外面有只鸟  死活不肯走
<1-22,Sheldon>There's a bird outside the window, and he won't go away.

31
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,230
<1-22,Sheldon>弄得我跟人间炼狱似的
<1-22,Sheldon>That is the hell that is going on.

32
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,160
<1-22,Sheldon>我们这儿既没虫子也没种子
<1-22,Sheldon>We have no worms or seeds here.

33
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,670
<1-22,Sheldon>去去  快走
<1-22,Sheldon>Shoo! Shoo!

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,360
<1-23,Penny>不是吧  这世界那么险恶  你怕的却是小鸟
<1-23,Penny>Really? On top of everything else, you're afraid of birds?

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,660
<1-24,Sheldon>这叫恐鸟症
<1-24,Sheldon>It's called ornithophobia.

36
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,190
<1-24,Sheldon>而且总有一天  恐鸟症会被视为一种残疾
<1-24,Sheldon>And someday it will be recognized as a true disability,

37
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,990
<1-24,Sheldon>房东必须按照法律规定
<1-24,Sheldon>and the landlord will be required by law

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,800
<1-24,Sheldon>给这栋楼加一张大网
<1-24,Sheldon>to put a giant net over the building.

39
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,200
<1-24,Sheldon>到时就悲剧了  因为我还怕网
<1-24,Sheldon>Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,750
<1-25,Penny>电影  你去不去
<1-25,Penny>So movies, yes or no?

41
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,390
<1-26,Leonard>去  一定去
<1-26,Leonard>Movies, yes.

42
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,870
<1-27,Penny>好  待会儿见
<1-27,Penny>Great. I'll see you later.

43
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,940
<1-27,Penny>记住啦  他其实比你还害怕呢
<1-27,Penny>And remember, he's more afraid of you than you are of him.

44
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,840
<1-28,Sheldon>说这话一点用都没有
<1-28,Sheldon>That doesn't help.

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,010
<1-29,Penny>谁跟你说了  我跟鸟说呢
<1-29,Penny>No, I was talking to the bird.

46
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,390
<1-30,Sheldon>小鸟快走  小鸟快走  小鸟快走
<1-30,Sheldon>Go away, bird. Go away, bird. Go away, bird.

47
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,180
<1-31,Leonard>谢尔顿  无视它不就行了
<1-31,Leonard>Sheldon, just ignore him.

48
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,670
<1-32,Sheldon>好主意  这鸟无非就是求关注
<1-32,Sheldon>Good idea. Attention is what birds want.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
<1-32,Sheldon>啊  好多了  好
<1-32,Sheldon>Oh, much better. All right.

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,500
<1-32,Sheldon>我现在可以安心了
<1-32,Sheldon>Now I'll just get along with my life.

51
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,370
<1-32,Sheldon>泡壶茶  莱纳德  今晚要跟它抗争到底了
<1-32,Sheldon>Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It's going to be a long night.

61
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,530
<2-1,Leonard>那鸟还没走呢
<2-1,Leonard>The bird's still there?

62
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,920
<2-2,Sheldon>快  老鹰是怎么叫的
<2-2,Sheldon>Quick, what does a hawk sound like?

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,650
<2-3,Leonard>我也不太清楚
<2-3,Leonard>I don't know--

64
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,030
<2-4,Sheldon>拜托  那是海鸥的声音
<2-4,Sheldon>Please, that's a seagull.

65
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,080
<2-4,Sheldon>你要是帮不上忙  就闭嘴
<2-4,Sheldon>If you're not going to help, don't help.

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,030
<2-5,Leonard>对不起  我穿得会不会太正式了
<2-5,Leonard>Sorry. Do you think I'm overdressed?

67
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,100
<2-6,Sheldon>这得看场合了
<2-6,Sheldon>It depends on the activity.

68
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,460
<2-6,Sheldon>如果去做前列腺检查  是有点正式
<2-6,Sheldon>For a prostate exam, yes.

70
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,670
<2-6,Sheldon>但如果是扮维加斯  我会加一些亮片
<2-6,Sheldon>If you're playing Vegas, I'd add sequins.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,640
<2-7,Leonard>我是要跟佩妮去看电影
<2-7,Leonard>I'm going to the movies with Penny.

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,810
<2-7,Leonard>我不想让她认为  我认为是约会
<2-7,Leonard>I don't want her to think that I think it's a date.

73
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,730
<2-8,Sheldon>你认为是约会吗
<2-8,Sheldon>Do you think it's a date?

74
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,710
<2-9,Leonard>不  但她会认为我是这么认为
<2-9,Leonard>No, but she might think I think it's a date

75
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,510
<2-9,Leonard>但其实我不是
<2-9,Leonard>even though I don't.

76
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,300
<2-10,Sheldon>说不定是你认为她认为你这么认为
<2-10,Sheldon>Or you might think she thinks you think it's a date

77
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,350
<2-10,Sheldon>其实她不是
<2-10,Sheldon>even though she doesn't.

78
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,380
<2-11,Leonard>-我们是不是想太多了  -绝对没有
<2-11,Leonard>- Are we overthinking this?  - Not at all.

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
<2-12,Sheldon>你说得对  算了  我就这么穿吧
<2-12,Sheldon>You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.

80
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,660
<2-12,Sheldon>不是吧  西装?  好吧
<2-12,Sheldon>Really? A blazer? All right.

81
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,330
<2-13,Leonard>喂  你好
<2-13,Leonard>Yes, hello.

82
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,260
<2-14,Sheldon>我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
<2-14,Sheldon>This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

83
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,190
<2-14,Sheldon>我住在罗夫莱斯北大街2311号
<2-14,Sheldon>I'm at 2311 North Robles Avenue.

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,900
<2-14,Sheldon>我这里有一只危险的野生动物
<2-14,Sheldon>I'd like to report a dangerous wild animal.

85
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,260
<2-14,Sheldon>一只蓝冠鸦
<2-14,Sheldon>A blue jay.

86
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,110
<2-14,Sheldon>不好意思  我找的就是动物管理部门
<2-14,Sheldon>I'm sorry, this is Animal Control.

87
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,070
<2-14,Sheldon>我不明白你笑什么
<2-14,Sheldon>I don't understand the laughter.

88
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,660
<2-14,Sheldon>不  那只鸟不在我家里
<2-14,Sheldon>No, the bird is not in my home.

89
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,040
<2-14,Sheldon>它要是在我家里  我早就打911报警了
<2-14,Sheldon>If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911.

90
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,890
<2-14,Sheldon>先生  我相信你也有害怕的东西
<2-14,Sheldon>Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you're frightened of.

91
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,130
<2-14,Sheldon>比如从事没前途的公共服务工作
<2-14,Sheldon>Being stuck in a dead-end public service job.

92
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,040
<2-14,Sheldon>或者你老婆背叛你
<2-14,Sheldon>Or your wife stepping out on you

93
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,600
<2-14,Sheldon>因为你从事的是没前途的公共服务工作
<2-14,Sheldon>because you're stuck in a dead-end public service job.

94
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,400
<2-14,Sheldon>又或者你怕蜘蛛
<2-14,Sheldon>Or spiders.

95
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,280
<2-14,Sheldon>学猫叫有用的话  打电话给你干嘛
<2-14,Sheldon>Don't you think I tried making cat noises?

96
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,880
<2-15,Leonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap)>会不会太休闲了
<2-15,Leonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap)>Too casual?

97
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,720
<2-16,Sheldon>去觐见女王的话  是太休闲了
<2-16,Sheldon>For an audience with the queen, yes.

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,640
<2-16,Sheldon>不过晚上去着火的垃圾箱旁边
<2-16,Sheldon>For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine

99
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,240
<2-16,Sheldon>扔一瓶烈酒  你的着装正合适
<2-16,Sheldon>around a flaming trash can, you look great.

100
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,230
<2-16,Sheldon>我想啥呢  居然没画胡子
<2-16,Sheldon>What am I thinking? Whiskers.

101
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,690
<3-1,Penny>现在买票的话  能赶上珍妮弗·安妮斯顿的新电影
<3-1,Penny>Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.

102
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,230
<3-1,Penny>对  没错
<3-1,Penny>Oh, yeah, sure.

103
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,460
<3-2,Leonard>不过还有一场精彩的纪录片
<3-2,Leonard>There's also an amazing documentary

104
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,300
<3-2,Leonard>讲述在南美洲的一条河上建一座水坝
<3-2,Leonard>about building a dam on a river in South America.

105
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,560
<3-3,Penny>可珍妮弗·安妮斯顿的电影里有珍妮弗·安妮斯顿
<3-3,Penny>Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston,

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,490
<3-3,Penny>而且她不会建什么水坝
<3-3,Penny>and she's not building a dam.

107
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,210
<3-4,Leonard>这倒是真的
<3-4,Leonard>Can't argue with that.

108
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,310
<3-4,Leonard>-我去买票  -好
<3-4,Leonard>- I'll get the tickets.  - Okay.

109
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,380
<3-6,Leonard>等等  其实呢
<3-6,Leonard>Actually, you know what?

110
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,400
<3-6,Leonard>我觉得现在该我挑电影了
<3-6,Leonard>I think it's about time I picked a movie we see.

111
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,760
<3-7,Penny>你都挑过好多次了
<3-7,Penny>You pick plenty of movies.

112
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,830
<3-8,Leonard>不  都是你挑的
<3-8,Leonard>No. You always picked,

113
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
<3-8,Leonard>而且每次都一样
<3-8,Leonard>and it was always the same.

114
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,700
<3-8,Leonard>前面90分钟都在说雨中的海滨别墅
<3-8,Leonard>An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain

115
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,310
<3-8,Leonard>最后女主角顿时醒悟
<3-8,Leonard>until the woman turns around

116
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,280
<3-8,Leonard>发现原来爱一直在身边
<3-8,Leonard>and realizes love was here all along.

117
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,070
<3-9,Penny>拜托  那电影很棒  而且还有10分钟就开演了
<3-9,Penny>Come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.

118
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,900
<3-10,Leonard>我讨厌这种电影
<3-10,Leonard>I hate those movies.

119
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,800
<3-11,Penny>-你不讨厌  -我真的讨厌
<3-11,Penny>- No, you don't.  - Yes, I do.

120
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,010
<3-12,Leonard>我之所以以前和你一起看  是因为你想看
<3-12,Leonard>The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them,

121
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,790
<3-12,Leonard>而我想和你滚床单
<3-12,Leonard>and I wanted to have sex.

122
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,500
<3-12,Leonard>而今天  我既然不能兴奋和性奋
<3-12,Leonard>To this day, I can't see a Sandra Bullock movie poster

123
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,340
<3-12,Leonard>还看什么桑德拉·布洛克的电影啊
<3-12,Leonard>without getting both bored and aroused.

124
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,550
<3-13,Penny>好吧  这么说我们约会的时候
<3-13,Penny>Okay, so while we were going out,

125
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,000
<3-13,Penny>你有多少次是假装听我的
<3-13,Penny>how often would you pretend

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,150
<3-13,Penny>其实只是为了和我滚床单

<3-15,Penny>不是吧
<3-15,Penny>You're kidding.

129
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,820
<3-16,Leonard>那你觉得这些话耳熟不
<3-16,Leonard>Does this sound familiar?

<3-16,Leonard>乐意之极
<3-16,Leonard>Who wouldn't?

135
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,520
<3-17,Penny>好吧  我们每次约会
<3-17,Penny>Okay, we were going out.

136
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,020
<3-17,Penny>-那次没有滚床单的  -是吗
<3-17,Penny>- You were going to get sex anyway. - Really?

137
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,890
<3-18,Leonard>你要是看了三小时水坝的纪录片  你还有性致吗
<3-18,Leonard>You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?

138
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,950
<3-19,Penny>没有  没女人会有
<3-19,Penny>No. No woman would.

139
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,330
<3-20,Leonard>瞧  这就是最棒的地方
<3-20,Leonard>See? Now, that's the great thing.

140
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,130
<3-20,Leonard>我们现在是朋友  不是在约会
<3-20,Leonard>We're out as friends. This is not a date.

141
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,670
<3-20,Leonard>滚床单没戏
<3-20,Leonard>Sex is off the table.

142
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,240
<3-20,Leonard>所以  我们就去看看水力发电
<3-20,Leonard>So, let's go learn how hydroelectric power

143
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,470
<3-20,Leonard>也许不是你想的那么环保
<3-20,Leonard>might not be the environmental bargain you think it is.

144
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,790
<3-20,Leonard>抱歉  剧透了
<3-20,Leonard>Sorry. Spoiler alert.

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,310
<3-22,Leonard>电影票十一块
<3-22,Leonard>Tickets are 11 bucks.

148
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,140
<3-22,Leonard>不是约会嘛
<3-22,Leonard>Not a date.

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,110
<4-1,Raj>快点  谢尔顿  来看《星球大战》
<4-1,Raj>Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.

150

<4-2,Howard>我要按播放键啦  我说真的
<4-2,Howard>I'm pushing play. I mean it.

151
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,940
<4-4,Howard>要是我们再不快点看
<4-4,Howard>If we don't start soon,

152
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,170
<4-4,Howard>乔治·卢卡斯又要出新版本了
<4-4,Howard>George Lucas is going to change it again.

153
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,220
<4-5,Sheldon>要是你那职业学校的学历有点用
<4-5,Sheldon>This would go a lot faster

154
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,890
<4-5,Sheldon>就过来帮我倒腾一下这台高音频发生器
<4-5,Sheldon>if you put your trade school diploma to work

155
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,750
<4-5,Sheldon>那我们的问题就解决了
<4-5,Sheldon>and helped me set up this high-frequency tone generator.

156
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,060
<4-6,Howard>我可是麻省理工的硕士生
<4-6,Howard>I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.

157
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,660
<4-7,Sheldon>好吧  你好歹有乐观苦干的态度
<4-7,Sheldon>Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude

158
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,130
<4-7,Sheldon>这才是重点
<4-7,Sheldon>and that's what's important.

159
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,010
<4-8,Raj>我真不懂你和鸟有什么仇
<4-8,Raj>I really don't get your problem with birds.

160
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,820
<4-9,Sheldon>你该这么问  鸟对我有什么仇
<4-9,Sheldon>The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me?

161
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,910
<4-9,Sheldon>我刚开始记事起  一只蜂鸟俯冲进我的婴儿车
<4-9,Sheldon>My first memory: A hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller

162
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,330
<4-9,Sheldon>偷吃了我吸管杯里的苹果汁
<4-9,Sheldon>to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.

163
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,960
<4-10,Raj>蜂鸟很美的
<4-10,Raj>Hummingbirds are pretty.

164
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,520
<4-11,Sheldon>蜂鸟是鲜花界的吸血鬼
<4-11,Sheldon>Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.

165
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,070
<4-12,Raj>还是我在脚踝纹身图案的首选
<4-12,Raj>Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo.

166
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,350
<4-12,Raj>或是海豚  我在这两者间犹豫不决
<4-12,Raj>Or a dolphin-- I go back and forth.

167
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,990
<4-13,Sheldon>我7岁时  一只丧心病狂的鸡追着我爬到树上
<4-13,Sheldon>Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree.

168
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,330
<4-13,Sheldon>12岁时  一只喜鹊想从我嘴里抢走牙套
<4-13,Sheldon>Age 12, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth.

169
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,570
<4-13,Sheldon>16岁时  宠物店的一只鹦鹉骂我胖仔
<4-13,Sheldon>Age 16, a parrot in a pet store calls me fat ass.

170
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,340
<4-13,Sheldon>我还要继续说吗
<4-13,Sheldon>Need I go on?

171
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,570
<4-14,Raj>当然  这可比电影有趣多了
<4-14,Raj>Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.

172
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,120
<4-15,Howard>好吧  谢尔顿
<4-15,Howard>All right, Sheldon,

173
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,210
<4-15,Howard>你的"杀鸟死光"准备好了
<4-15,Howard>your bird death ray is ready.

174
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,780
<4-16,Sheldon>这不是"死光"
<4-16,Sheldon>It's not a death ray.

175
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,890
<4-16,Sheldon>只是弄点超声波好吓跑他
<4-16,Sheldon>It's just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off.

176
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,890
<4-16,Sheldon>相信我  如果我有"死光"
<4-16,Sheldon>Trust me, if I had a death ray,

177
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,770
<4-16,Sheldon>我就不会住这儿了
<4-16,Sheldon>I wouldn't be living here.

178
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,200
<4-16,Sheldon>我会坐在用不完的钱堆上
<4-16,Sheldon>I'd be in my lair enjoying the money

179
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,310
<4-16,Sheldon>都是人们送来贿赂我求我别用"死光"
<4-16,Sheldon>the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray.

180
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,350
<4-16,Sheldon>好吧  三
<4-16,Sheldon>All right, and in three,

<5-1,Leonard>村庄要被淹没  所有人要搬家时
<5-1,Leonard>I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded,

185
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,490
<5-1,Leonard>我看你都哭了
<5-1,Leonard>and everyone had to relocate.

186
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,930
<5-2,Penny>不  我是想为什么他们能走而我不行
<5-2,Penny>No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can't.

187
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,760
<5-3,Leonard>我去买点薯条
<5-3,Leonard>I'm going to get some fries.

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,920
<5-5,Leonard>你每次都说不要  却把我的吃掉一半
<5-5,Leonard>You always say no, and then you eat half my fries.

191
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,320
<5-6,Penny>我只是吃那些酥脆的  反正你不喜欢
<5-6,Penny>I just eat the little crispy ones you don't like.

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,060
<5-7,Leonard>不  我超喜欢  我只是留到最后吃
<5-7,Leonard>No, I love them. I save them for the end,

193
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,130
<5-7,Leonard>结果却被你吃光光
<5-7,Leonard>but they're gone because you ate them.

194
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,740
<5-7,Leonard>我为什么让你吃呢
<5-7,Leonard>And why did I let you eat them?

195
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,570
<5-8,Penny>-你想滚床单  -没错
<5-8,Penny>- To get sex.  - Exactly.

196
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,740
<5-9,Leonard>但这不是约会

<9-21,Leonard>You didn't see me telling Kevin that

312
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,100
<9-21,Leonard>你认为冷战只在冬天开战
<9-21,Leonard>you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.

313
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,340
<9-22,Penny>好吧  那我就还你人情  不告诉...
<9-22,Penny>Okay. Then I'll return the favor, and I won't tell...

314
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,740

316
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,220
<9-25,Leonard>你向凯文讲述你的演艺生涯时
<9-25,Leonard>When you were telling Kevin about your acting career,

317
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,180
<9-25,Leonard>有提到你在本土商家芝士工厂内
<9-25,Leonard>did you mention your long-running role as "Waitress"

318
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,510
<9-25,Leonard>长期"扮演"女服务生的角色吗

<9-26,Penny>那你告诉了她  你有哮喘了吗
<9-26,Penny>Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?

<9-27,Leonard>是吗  那你说说"哮喘"怎么写
<9-27,Leonard>Oh, yeah? Spell "asthma."

323
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,030
<9-29,Leonard>我还没跟她聊够呢
<9-29,Leonard>Maybe I'm not done hanging out with...

324
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,360
<9-29,Leonard>你说得对  太晚了
<9-29,Leonard>You're right, it's getting late.

325
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,870
<10-1,Sheldon>真是奇了怪了
<10-1,Sheldon>It's remarkable.

326
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,240
<10-1,Sheldon>我居然怕了这么长时间
<10-1,Sheldon>All that time spent in fear.

327
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,140
<10-1,Sheldon>何必呢
<10-1,Sheldon>And for what?

328
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,850
<10-1,Sheldon>他真是太美了
<10-1,Sheldon>He's magnificent.

329
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,210
<10-1,Sheldon>天啊
<10-1,Sheldon>Oh, dear.

330
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,600
<10-1,Sheldon>我刚想起  我还没给你上饮料
<10-1,Sheldon>I just realized I haven't offered you a beverage.

331
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,390
<10-2,Bernadette>就像我祖母跟她的鹦鹉一样
<10-2,Bernadette>Oh, it's just like my grandma with her parrot.

332
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,900
<10-2,Bernadette>尤其在遥控器不好使后  这么喂还能顺便换台
<10-2,Bernadette>And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.

333
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,970
<10-3,Sheldon>我电话在那边桌上
<10-3,Sheldon>My phone's on the desk over there.

334
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,050
<10-3,Sheldon>给我们俩拍张照片
<10-3,Sheldon>Take a picture of us together.

335
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,210
<10-3,Sheldon>拍好点  我要贴上马克杯  鼠标垫和日历
<10-3,Sheldon>Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar.

336
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,420
<10-3,Sheldon>你要是鸽子  我就叫你爱鸽
<10-3,Sheldon>If you were a dove, I'd call you Lovey-Dovey.

337
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,110
<10-3,Sheldon>开什么玩笑
<10-3,Sheldon>Oh. Who am I kidding?

338
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,350
<10-3,Sheldon>现在就不该拘泥于字面意思
<10-3,Sheldon>This isn't a moment for strict adherence to the literal.

339
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,220
<10-3,Sheldon>你就是我的爱鸽  不是吗
<10-3,Sheldon>You're just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren't you?

341
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,450
<10-4,Amy>估计你的骨头也是中空的
<10-4,Amy>Guess you gotta have hollow bones

342
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,090
<10-4,Amy>才能承载这么多甜言蜜语
<10-4,Amy>to get some sugar around here.

343
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,530
<10-5,Bernadette>我还是觉得他是别人家的宠物
<10-5,Bernadette>I still think he looks like someone's pet.

344
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,600
<10-5,Bernadette>或许我们该去贴失物招领
<10-5,Bernadette>Maybe we should put up posters.

345
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,970
<10-6,Sheldon>对  要附上他的一张大照片
<10-6,Sheldon>Yes. It should have a big picture of him,

346
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,300
<10-6,Sheldon>还要写上"这是你的鸟吗  现在成我的了"
<10-6,Sheldon>and the words, "Is this your bird? Not anymore."

347
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,370
<10-6,Sheldon>我们在一起肯定会很开心
<10-6,Sheldon>We're going to have so much fun together.

348
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,330
<10-6,Sheldon>你可以帮我捎口信给我所有的敌人
<10-6,Sheldon>You can carry messages to all my enemies.

349
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,030
<10-6,Sheldon>还可以在你腿上系上绳  像放风筝拽着玩
<10-6,Sheldon>I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.

350
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,110
<10-7,Amy>你要想收留他  我可以借你个笼子
<10-7,Amy>If you're keeping him, I've got a cage you can borrow.

351
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,000
<10-7,Amy>那笼子以前关的实验猴  踩到香蕉皮
<10-7,Amy>One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,480
<10-7,Amy>把脖子摔断了
<10-7,Amy>and broke his neck.

353
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,150
<10-7,Amy>悲剧和喜剧同时上演
<10-7,Amy>It was both tragic and hysterical.

354
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,780
<10-8,Sheldon>荒谬
<10-8,Sheldon>Nonsense.

355
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,920
<10-8,Sheldon>不行  爱鸽才不睡笼子里
<10-8,Sheldon>No. Lovey-Dovey doesn't sleep in a cage.

356
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,260
<10-8,Sheldon>爱鸽要睡在他自己的巢里
<10-8,Sheldon>No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest,

357
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,730
<10-8,Sheldon>我要把窗台的巢拿下来  放我房间里
<10-8,Sheldon>which I'm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room.

<10-8,Sheldon>This is your home now!

363

<10-8,Sheldon>我已经从亚马逊订了20磅鸟食
<10-8,Sheldon>I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon!

364
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,020
<10-8,Sheldon>他不见了
<10-8,Sheldon>He's gone.

365
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,290
<10-9,Amy>节哀顺变  谢尔顿
<10-9,Amy>I'm sorry, Sheldon.

366
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,740
<10-10,Sheldon>他怎么能这么对我呢
<10-10,Sheldon>How could he do this to me?

367
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,950
<10-10,Sheldon>回来  笨鸟  不然我的爱给谁去
<10-10,Sheldon>Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!

370
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,920
<11-1,Leonard>好了  我们一起出去了
<11-1,Leonard>Okay. So... we went out,

371
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,490
<11-1,Leonard>看了电影  认识了不错的人
<11-1,Leonard>saw a movie, met some nice people,

372
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,820
<11-1,Leonard>公开说了一些彼此的坏话
<11-1,Leonard>said horrible things about each other in public...

373
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,160
<11-1,Leonard>总而言之  真是个神奇的夜晚
<11-1,Leonard>all in all, a pretty magical night.

374
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,330
<11-2,Penny>好吧  这事我也有错
<11-2,Penny>Okay, I'm not innocent in all this,

375
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,330
<11-2,Penny>但你居然说我笨  你个患哮喘的蠢蛋
<11-2,Penny>but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.

376
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,440
<11-3,Leonard>我知道  我是过分了
<11-3,Leonard>I know, I-I-I crossed a line.

377
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,170
<11-3,Leonard>我很抱歉
<11-3,Leonard>And I'm sorry.

378
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,400
<11-3,Leonard>别走  等等  我是真的很抱歉
<11-3,Leonard>No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it.

379
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,130
<11-3,Leonard>这并不是像我们以前交往那样
<11-3,Leonard>And it's not like when we were going out,

380
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,960
<11-3,Leonard>我不是为了跟你滚床单才道歉的
<11-3,Leonard>I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed.

381
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,800
<11-5,Leonard>这句"我很抱歉"是纯发自内心  与滚床单无关
<11-5,Leonard>This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table "I'm sorry."

382
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,040
<11-4,Penny>好吧  谢谢你
<11-4,Penny>All right. Thank you.

383
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,270
<11-4,Penny>我也很抱歉
<11-4,Penny>I'm sorry, too.

384
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,500
<11-5,Leonard>我再确认下  滚床单没戏  对吧
<11-5,Leonard>Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?

385
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,150
<11-6,Penny>绝对没戏
<11-6,Penny>Way off.

386
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,960
<11-7,Leonard>也许我们还没准备好像朋友一样出去玩
<11-7,Leonard>Maybe we're not ready to hang out as friends.

387
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,350
<11-8,Penny>我也不知道  其实在事情搞砸之前
<11-8,Penny>I don't know. Up until the last part,

388
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,440
<11-8,Penny>我还是很喜欢管着莱纳德
<11-8,Penny>I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard

389
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,120
<11-8,Penny>当他的主心骨
<11-8,Penny>with a little backbone.

390
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,970
<11-8,Penny>我来选电影  我知道他想要什么
<11-8,Penny>Picking the movie, knowing what he wants,

391
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,510
<11-8,Penny>还有点自大
<11-8,Penny>a little cocky.

392
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,610
<11-10,Penny>-真的吗  -真的
<11-10,Penny>- Really?  - Yeah.

393
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,230
<11-11,Leonard>好吧  那就是说滚床单有戏咯
<11-11,Leonard>Well, then, I'm putting sex back on the table.

394
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,220
<11-11,Leonard>你觉得怎么样
<11-11,Leonard>What do you think about that?

395
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,320
<11-12,Penny>-或许我会喜欢  -是吗
<11-12,Penny>- Ooh. Maybe I like it. - You do?

396
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,230
<11-13,Leonard>真的  要是你喜欢  我可以恢复原样
<11-13,Leonard>Because if that's what you like, I can be that guy.

397
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,990
<11-13,Leonard>我发誓  你让我往东我绝不往西
<11-13,Leonard>I swear, I'll be anything you want me to be.

398
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,660
<11-14,Penny>晚安  莱纳德
<11-14,Penny>Good night, Leonard.

399
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,240
<11-15,Leonard>我还真是个患哮喘的蠢蛋
<11-15,Leonard>I am such an asthmatic dumbass.

400
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,640
<11-15,Leonard>我今晚过得很怪怪的
<11-15,Leonard>I had a weird night.

401
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,080
<11-16,Sheldon>我过得很好
<11-16,Sheldon>Mine was great.
