26
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,570
<1-1,Penny>我有点迷糊了
<1-1,Penny>Okay, I'm confused.

27
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,380
<1-1,Penny>《黑客军团》的黑客先生是哪位
<1-1,Penny>Which one is Mr. Robot?

28
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,890
<1-2,Leonard>我给你个提示
<1-2,Leonard>I'll give you a hint.

29
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,370
<1-2,Leonard>我们在看的是《夜魔侠》
<1-2,Leonard>We're watching Daredevil.

30
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,980
<1-3,Sheldon>麻烦你俩告诉艾米
<1-3,Sheldon>Will you two please inform Amy

31
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,930
<1-3,Sheldon>你们有多享受遵守严格的如厕时间表吗
<1-3,Sheldon>how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?

32
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,780
<1-3,Sheldon>-不行  -不想
<1-3,Sheldon>- Can't. - Won't.

33
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,500
<1-3,Sheldon>-没有过  -也不会
<1-3,Sheldon>- Didn't. - Don't.

34
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,690
<1-5,Leonard>我跟你说了
<1-5,Leonard>I told you,

35
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,990
<1-7,Leonard>你不能规定我们生活大小事都按表操课
<1-7,Leonard>you can't regulate every aspect of our lives.

36
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,090
<1-9,Sheldon>你要是乖乖配合接受统治  我就能啦
<1-9,Sheldon>I can if you'd just roll over and accept your fate.

37
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,590
<1-10,Amy>抱歉把家丑闹到你们面前
<1-10,Amy>I'm sorry for bringing this over here.

38
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,360
<1-11,Penny>相信我  我们特理解你现在面临的问题
<1-11,Penny>Believe me, we know what you're going through.

39
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,070
<1-12,Leonard>我们能给你的最实用建议就是
<1-12,Leonard>And I-I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is

40
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,230
<1-12,Leonard>绝不退缩
<1-12,Leonard>no backsies.

41
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,400
<1-13,Penny>谢尔顿  我明白
<1-13,Penny>Sheldon, I understand

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,700
<1-14,Amy>你喜欢事情按你方式来
<1-14,Amy>that you like things a certain way

43
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,380
<1-14,Amy>我也愿意做出一些让步
<1-14,Amy>and I'm willing to make some concessions,

44
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,780
<1-14,Amy>但你同样也得愿意做出妥协啊
<1-14,Amy>but you have to be open to compromise.

45
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,290
<1-15,Penny>她说得对  这话在理
<1-15,Penny>She's right. That's reasonable.

46
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,320
<1-16,Sheldon>瞧瞧支持做出妥协的人是谁
<1-16,Sheldon>Oh, look who's in favor of compromise,

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,160
<1-16,Sheldon>不正是嫁给莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德的女人吗
<1-16,Sheldon>the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.

48
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,780
<1-17,Leonard>她才不是妥协好吗
<1-17,Leonard>Hey, she didn't compromise.

49
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,130
<1-17,Leonard>她只是放弃抵抗了  有区别好吗
<1-17,Leonard>She settled. There's a difference.

50
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,310
<1-18,Penny>没错  宝贝你说得真对
<1-18,Penny>Yeah. You tell him, babe.

60
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,480
<2-1,Raj>你跟伯纳黛特几点出发
<2-1,Raj>What time do you and Bernadette head out?

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,280
<2-2,Howard>我一到家就出发
<2-2,Howard>As soon as I get home.

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,930
<2-2,Howard>我们希望能在天黑前就到那里
<2-2,Howard>We're hoping to make it before dark.

63
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,460
<2-3,Raj>我从来没去过棕榈泉市
<2-3,Raj>I've never been to Palm Springs.

64
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,300
<2-4,Stuart>你应该去看看
<2-4,Stuart>Oh, you should go.

65
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,160
<2-4,Stuart>那里超棒  像我个人就在
<2-4,Stuart>It's terrific. I-I really thrive anywhere

66
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,160
<2-4,Stuart>女人年纪与华氏度超过90的地方特别吃得开
<2-4,Stuart>the women and the temperature are over 90.

67
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,630
<2-4,Stuart>这个嘛...
<2-4,Stuart>I don't know.

68
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,130
<2-5,Raj>如果我想看老人汗流浃背
<2-5,Raj>If I want to watch old people sweat,

69
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,270
<2-5,Raj>我就跟我印度家人视频聊天就行啦
<2-5,Raj>I can just FaceTime my family in India.

70
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,270
<2-6,Stuart>我觉得你跟伯纳黛特能出去玩玩挺好
<2-6,Stuart>It's nice you and Bernadette are getting away.

71
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,020
<2-7,Howard>她想在孩子出生前
<2-7,Howard>Well, she wants us to spend more time together

72
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,310
<2-7,Howard>多跟我享受点二人世界
<2-7,Howard>before the baby comes.

73
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,760
<2-8,Stuart>那你为啥还来买漫画
<2-8,Stuart>So then what are you doing here buying comic books?

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,160
<2-9,Howard>他也想在孩子出生前
<2-9,Howard>Well, he wants us to spend more time together

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,250
<2-9,Howard>多跟我享受点二人世界
<2-9,Howard>before the baby comes.

76
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,870
<3-1,Leonard>跟别人同住  肯定会有争执
<3-1,Leonard>When you live with someone, there's gonna be conflict.

77
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,290
<3-1,Leonard>重点是要不断沟通交流
<3-1,Leonard>You just have to keep communicating.

78
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,270
<3-2,Sheldon>我愿意啊
<3-2,Sheldon>I'm open to that.

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,240
<3-3,Amy>好  那首先我想说
<3-3,Amy>Okay. Well, for starters,

80
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
<3-3,Amy>把我们俩的牙刷放在同个牙刷桶上
<3-3,Amy>there's nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes

81
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,470
<3-3,Amy>没什么问题啊
<3-3,Amy>in the same holder.

82
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,290
<3-4,Penny>谢尔顿  你觉得呢
<3-4,Penny>Sheldon, what do you say to that?

83
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,370
<3-5,Sheldon>我们还是另觅新欢吧
<3-5,Sheldon>I think we should see other people.

84
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,150
<3-6,Amy>什么
<3-6,Amy>What?!

85
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,300
<3-7,Sheldon>我身为雄性生物  体内有让我想
<3-7,Sheldon>Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive

86
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,990
<3-7,Sheldon>将我基因传承下去的冲动
<3-7,Sheldon>to perpetuate my DNA.

87
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,150
<3-7,Sheldon>限制自己只有一个伴侣违反了我的天性
<3-7,Sheldon>Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.

88
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,940
<3-8,Amy>我们一年才"睡"一次
<3-8,Amy>We sleep together once a year!

89
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,520
<3-8,Amy>你还想有其他伴侣吗
<3-8,Amy>You want other partners?

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,510
<3-9,Sheldon>别怪我  要怪就怪你亲爱的生物学
<3-9,Sheldon>Don't blame me. Blame your pal, biology.

91
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,080
<3-9,Sheldon>他才是在背后控制这一切的变态
<3-9,Sheldon>He's the pervert pulling the strings here.

92
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,680
<3-10,Amy>你想找新欢是吗  那你就去啊
<3-10,Amy>You wanna see other people? Go see other people.

93
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,080
<3-11,Penny>最好找到一根香蕉  他俩就是在耍猴戏
<3-11,Penny>I hope one of those people is a monkey, 'cause this is bananas.

94
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,120
<3-12,Leonard>随便你开玩笑  但争吵持续升温
<3-12,Leonard>You can make jokes, but if this keeps up,

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,740
<3-12,Leonard>-最后他又得搬回来了  -好吧
<3-12,Leonard>- he's gonna move back in here. - All right.

96
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,050
<3-13,Penny>那就先把他俩分开
<3-13,Penny>Well, let's just get them apart for a while

97
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,110
<3-13,Penny>-让他们冷静冷静  -好
<3-13,Penny>- so they can cool down. - Good.

98
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,870
<3-14,Leonard>在我们重新让他们见面之前
<3-14,Leonard>Then before we reintroduce them,

99
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,990
<3-14,Leonard>我们可以给他一件她的外套
<3-14,Leonard>we'll give him one of her sweaters

100
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,600
<3-14,Leonard>让他重新熟悉一下她的气味[养宠物]
<3-14,Leonard>so he can get used to her scent again.

101
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,930
<3-15,Penny>所以你开玩笑就可以吗
<3-15,Penny>So it's okay for you to joke around?

102
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,900
<3-16,Leonard>不是啊  霍华德从太空回来时
<3-16,Leonard>No, that's actually what we did with him

103
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,080
<3-16,Leonard>我们就是这么让他重新接受霍华德
<3-16,Leonard>when Howard came back from space.

104
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,700
<4-1,Howard>亲爱的  你还好吗
<4-1,Howard>Honey, how ya feeling?

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,650
<4-1,Howard>书上说怀孕到了这个阶段
<4-1,Howard>The book says at this stage of the pregnancy

106
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,140
<4-1,Howard>晨吐的症状应该会没了
<4-1,Howard>morning sickness should be going away.

107
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,620
<4-1,Howard>这算好消息吧
<4-1,Howard>So that's good news, right?

108
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,880
<4-2,Bernadette (pff)>现在唯一比你还让我讨厌的事物  就是那本书
<4-2,Bernadette (pff)>The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book!

109
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,670
<4-3,Howard>她总算出来了
<4-3,Howard>There she is!

110
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,910
<4-3,Howard>谁准备好要开启
<4-3,Howard>Who's ready for a hot,

111
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,640
<4-3,Howard>三小时的炎热沙漠车程了呢
<4-3,Howard>three-hour car ride to the desert?

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,580
<4-4,Bernadette>下一次就吐在你大腿上
<4-4,Bernadette>Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.

113
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,460
<4-4,Bernadette>对不起啦
<4-4,Bernadette>I'm sorry.

114
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,560
<4-5,Howard>我们也可以不去啊
<4-5,Howard>We don't have to go.

115
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,450
<4-6,Bernadette>这是我们最后一次
<4-6,Bernadette>But it's our last chance to take a vacation

116
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,040
<4-6,Bernadette>二人旅行的机会了
<4-6,Bernadette>that's just the two of us.

117
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,920
<4-7,Howard>我们就待家里怎么样
<4-7,Howard>How 'bout we stay here?

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,470
<4-7,Howard>不用告诉其他人啊
<4-7,Howard>We don't even have to tell anyone.

119
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,930
<4-7,Howard>就像个秘密家中度假
<4-7,Howard>It'll be like a secret vacation at home.

120
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,660
<4-8,Bernadette>对我们朋友有秘密
<4-8,Bernadette>Keeping secrets from our friends--

121
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,100
<4-8,Bernadette>听起来的确挺有意思
<4-8,Bernadette>that does sound kinda fun.

122
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,870
<4-9,Howard>听起来...
<4-9,Howard>Does it sound...

123
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,560
<4-9,Howard>性感咩
<4-9,Howard>sexy?

124
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,740
<4-10,Bernadette>我大吐特吐的全过程你都听见了
<4-10,Bernadette>You just heard me throwing up.

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,050
<4-11,Howard>当然啦
<4-11,Howard>You bet I did.

126
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,030
<4-12,Bernadette>你的点好怪啊
<4-12,Bernadette>You're so weird.

127
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,170
<4-13,Howard>你知道怪的是什么吗
<4-13,Howard>You know what's weird?

128
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,900
<4-13,Howard>是你现在有多"性"奋
<4-13,Howard>How turned on you are right now.

129
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,170
<5-1,Sheldon>别人总是第一反应就指责我
<5-1,Sheldon>You know, people are quick to accuse me

130
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,470
<5-1,Sheldon>说我是难搞的室友
<5-1,Sheldon>of being difficult to live with,

131
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,850
<5-1,Sheldon>但事实上  艾米也一样龟毛
<5-1,Sheldon>but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.

132
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,570
<5-2,Penny>一样龟毛
<5-2,Penny>Just as challenging.

133
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,740
<5-3,Sheldon>没错
<5-3,Sheldon>Yes.

134
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,730
<5-4,Penny>跟你一样
<5-4,Penny>As you.

135
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,190
<5-3,Sheldon>对的
<5-3,Sheldon>Yes.

136
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,170
<5-6,Penny>跟你一样龟毛吗
<5-6,Penny>Just as challenging as you.

137
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,210
<5-7,Sheldon>当我们一起睡时
<5-7,Sheldon>When we're sleeping,

138
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,120
<5-7,Sheldon>她会冲着我呼吸
<5-7,Sheldon>she breathes on me.

139
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,130
<5-7,Sheldon>有一晚  她鼻息大到我差点抓起托托
<5-7,Sheldon>One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto

140
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,640
<5-7,Sheldon>冲进防龙卷风地窖里避难了[《绿野仙踪》]
<5-7,Sheldon>and headed for the storm cellar.

141
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,480
<5-8,Penny>莱纳德也会冲着我呼吸
<5-8,Penny>Leonard breathes on me, too.

142
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,570
<5-8,Penny>这没什么
<5-8,Penny>It's not a big deal.

143
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,050
<5-9,Sheldon>她总是抱怨同事不好
<5-9,Sheldon>She's always complaining about people at work.

144
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,230
<5-10,Penny>莱纳德也是这样
<5-10,Penny>Well, so does Leonard.

145
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,370
<5-10,Penny>虽然很烦人  但也不像世界末日那样严重啊
<5-10,Penny>It's kind of annoying, but it's not the end of the world.

146
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,990
<5-11,Sheldon>你知道吗  我洗完澡出来
<5-11,Sheldon>Do you know that when I get out of the shower,

147
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,260
<5-11,Sheldon>她对我上下打量  好像人家只是一坨小鲜肉
<5-11,Sheldon>she eyes me up and down like I'm a piece of meat?

148
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,130
<5-12,Penny>莱纳德也这样
<5-12,Penny>You know, so does Leonard.

149
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,460
<5-12,Penny>就不能有一天我早上洗漱时
<5-12,Penny>Can't I just get ready in the morning

150
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,570
<5-12,Penny>他不举起他的傻逼拇指吗
<5-12,Penny>without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up?

151
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,280
<5-13,Sheldon>我懂
<5-13,Sheldon>I know.

152
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,410
<5-13,Sheldon>有时候我真希望她欣赏的是我的头脑
<5-13,Sheldon>Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.

153
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,070
<5-14,Penny>同意  握爪
<5-14,Penny>Agreed! Thank you!

154
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,840
<6-1,Bernadette>好舒服
<6-1,Bernadette>That feels great.

155
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,590
<6-2,Howard>是吧  从你耳朵变出一个硬币来
<6-2,Howard>Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear

156
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,440
<6-2,Howard>并不是这双手唯一会的魔法
<6-2,Howard>isn't the only magic these hands can do.

157
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,060
<6-2,Howard>话说你脚趾间的是什么呀
<6-2,Howard>In fact, wh-what's this between your toes?!

158
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,000
<6-3,Bernadette>你能消停两分钟
<6-3,Bernadette>Can you please stop

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,450
<6-3,Bernadette>别再从我身上变钱出来吗
<6-3,Bernadette>making money come out of me for two minutes?

160
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,540
<6-3,Bernadette>是前门吗
<6-3,Bernadette>Was that the front door?

161
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,420
<6-4,Howard>听起来是的
<6-4,Howard>It sounded like it.

162
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,080
<6-4,Howard>我的天  有人进屋了
<6-4,Howard>Oh, my God. Someone's in the house.

163
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,830
<6-5,Bernadette>锁门  锁门
<6-5,Bernadette>Lock the door, lock the door!

164
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,590
<6-6,Howard>我们应该报警
<6-6,Howard>We should call the police. Uh...

165
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,020
<6-7,Bernadette>我的手机在楼下
<6-7,Bernadette>I left my phone downstairs.

166
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,590
<6-8,Howard>见鬼  我也一样
<6-8,Howard>Damn, so did I.

167
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,390
<6-9,Bernadette>等等  我的iPad在这里  我们怎么办
<6-9,Bernadette>Wait, I have my iPad! What are we gonna do?

168
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,260
<6-10,Howard>给警察发邮件吗
<6-10,Howard>E-mail 911?

169
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,520
<6-11,Bernadette>说这种话没用
<6-11,Bernadette>That's not helpful!

170
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,900
<6-12,Howard>你知道我在压力下都靠幽默缓解
<6-12,Howard>You know I rely on humor in times of stress.

171
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,920
<6-13,Bernadette>等你要开始幽默了再告诉我  因为刚才不好笑
<6-13,Bernadette>Let me know when you start, because that wasn't funny!

172
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,810
<6-14,Howard>是热水浴缸的声音吗
<6-14,Howard>Is that the hot tub?

173
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,090
<6-15,Bernadette>谁会用咱家的热水浴缸
<6-15,Bernadette>Who would use our hot tub?

174
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,430
<6-16,Howard>比起你想的答案  既令人安心
<6-16,Howard>Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing

175
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,970
<6-16,Howard>也让人更恶心
<6-16,Howard>than you think.

176
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,110
<6-17,Bernadette>是谁
<6-17,Bernadette>Who is it?

177
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,850
<6-18,Howard>斯图尔特
<6-18,Howard>Stuart.

178
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,310
<6-18,Howard>他听到我提及咱们要出门
<6-18,Howard>He heard me talking about us going away.

179
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,790
<6-18,Howard>看来他决定不请自来了
<6-18,Howard>I guess he decided to invite himself over?

180
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,700
<6-19,Bernadette>我们要跟他说点什么吗
<6-19,Bernadette>Should we say something to him?

181
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
<6-20,Howard>也许  说这个如何
<6-20,Howard>Maybe. How 'bout,

182
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,390
<6-20,Howard>"你看起来像块煮熟的鸡胸肉"
<6-20,Howard>"Hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast"?

183
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,990
<6-21,Bernadette>我是说问他  "你在这里做什么"
<6-21,Bernadette>I meant like, "What are you doing here?"

184
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,290
<6-22,Howard>不要  那样伤不到他的心
<6-22,Howard>Nah, that's not gonna hurt his feelings.

185
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,030
<7-1,Amy>为什么他这么难相处
<7-1,Amy>Why is nothing easy with him?

186
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,850
<7-2,Leonard>关于谢尔顿有一点你要知道
<7-2,Leonard>Look, here's the thing you need to understand about Sheldon:

187
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,070
<7-2,Leonard>他烂透了
<7-2,Leonard>he's the worst.

188
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,450
<7-3,Amy>我宁愿想成是难以相处
<7-3,Amy>I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.

189
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,290
<7-4,Leonard>我宁愿想自己身高有1米78
<7-4,Leonard>I prefer to think of myself as five-ten,

190
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,690
<7-4,Leonard>但我所有的裤子依然得裁短
<7-4,Leonard>but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.

191
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,550
<7-5,Amy>我想我早该知道会有如此下场
<7-5,Amy>I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.

192
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,300
<7-6,Leonard>别难为自己
<7-6,Leonard>Don't beat yourself up.

193
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,110
<7-6,Leonard>你以前没和任何人同居过
<7-6,Leonard>You've never lived with anyone before.

194
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,720
<7-8,Leonard>-没错  -你的第一个同居对象
<7-8,Leonard>- That's true. - And you're starting out

195
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,660
<7-8,Leonard>就是谢尔顿·库珀
<7-8,Leonard>with Sheldon Cooper.

196
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,670
<7-8,Leonard>这就像第一次养宠物就养的是...
<7-8,Leonard>That's like getting your first pet and having it be--

197
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,060
<7-8,Leonard>我不知道
<7-8,Leonard>I don't know...

198
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,760
<7-8,Leonard>什么宠物能毁掉你的人生
<7-8,Leonard>What's a kind of pet that ruins your life?

199
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,840
<7-9,Amy>你这话没有安慰作用
<7-9,Amy>You're not making me feel better.

200
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,320
<7-10,Leonard>佩妮和我刚开始同居时
<7-10,Leonard>Look, even when Penny and I started living together,

201
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,460
<7-10,Leonard>也是有学习过程的
<7-10,Leonard>there was a-a learning curve.

202
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,830
<7-10,Leonard>但我向你保证  会越来越好的
<7-10,Leonard>But I promise you, it does get easier.

203
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,500
<7-11,Amy>他在浴室里放了个标牌  上面写着
<7-11,Amy>He put a sign up in the bathroom that says,

204
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,800
<7-11,Amy>"肥皂上没有艾米头发的天数"
<7-11,Amy>"Number of days without Amy's hair on the soap."

205
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,090
<7-11,Amy>对
<7-11,Amy>Yeah.

206
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,140
<7-12,Leonard>我的记录是六天
<7-12,Leonard>My record was six.

207
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,210
<8-1,Bernadette>你是不是也觉得  看着他
<8-1,Bernadette>Is it me, or is there something fun

208
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,440
<8-1,Bernadette>漂在那里  挺有意思的
<8-1,Bernadette>about watching him just float there?

209
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,460
<8-2,Howard>也许这就是人们养鱼的原因
<8-2,Howard>Maybe this is why people get fish tanks.

210
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,960
<8-2,Howard>谁打开了门廊的灯
<8-2,Howard>Who just turned the porch lights on?

211
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,080
<8-3,Bernadette>还有其他人吗
<8-3,Bernadette>Is someone else here?

212
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,920
<8-4,Raj>他们肯定忘了关热水浴缸
<8-4,Raj>They must have left the tub on.

213
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,100
<8-4,Raj>幸好我来了
<8-4,Raj>Good thing I stopped by.

214
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,440
<8-5,Stuart>你在这里做什么
<8-5,Stuart>What are you doing here?!

215
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,940
<8-5,Stuart>你又在这里做什么
<8-5,Stuart>What are you doing here?!

216
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,330
<8-6,Raj>也许霍华德和伯纳黛特说了我可以来
<8-6,Raj>Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here!

217
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,830
<8-7,Stuart>他们说了吗
<8-7,Stuart>Did they?

218
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,090
<8-8,Raj>回答问题  你在这里做什么
<8-8,Raj>Answer the question! What are you doing here?!

219
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,940
<8-9,Stuart>我今晚没事做
<8-9,Stuart>I had nothing else to do tonight.

220
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,500
<8-9,Stuart>过去几个月
<8-9,Stuart>The last couple of months,

221
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,550
<8-9,Stuart>我知道他们不在家时便会来这里
<8-9,Stuart>I come here when I know they're not home.

222
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,490
<8-10,Bernadette>什么
<8-10,Bernadette>What?!

223
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,980
<8-11,Stuart>有次我在灌木丛被他们听到
<8-11,Stuart>They heard me in the bushes once,

224
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,140
<8-11,Stuart>但他们以为是浣熊
<8-11,Stuart>but they thought it was a raccoon.

225
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,660
<8-12,Bernadette>我就跟你说浣熊不会说"噢哦"
<8-12,Bernadette>I told you raccoons don't say "Uh-oh."

226
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,480
<9-1,Penny>有一晚  莱纳德的鼻息声太大
<9-1,Penny>You know, one night, Leonard's nose whistled so loud,

227
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,310
<9-1,Penny>我发誓就像睡在火车轨上一样
<9-1,Penny>I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,570
<9-2,Sheldon>-你有注意到一直是降A调吗  -是吗
<9-2,Sheldon>- Have you noticed it's always an A-flat? - Is it?

229
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,530
<9-3,Penny>就像他的鼻窦炎就在车里一样
<9-3,Penny>It's like his sinuses are right here in the car.

230
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,730
<9-4,Sheldon>如果我们只是漫无目的地瞎晃悠
<9-4,Sheldon>If we're just going to drive around aimlessly,

231
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,700
<9-4,Sheldon>至少你可以送我去吃冰淇淋吧
<9-4,Sheldon>the least you could do is take me for ice cream.

232
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,310
<9-5,Penny>好  我带你去吃冰淇淋
<9-5,Penny>Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.

233
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,330
<9-6,Sheldon>瞧  为什么艾米不能这么听话呢
<9-6,Sheldon>Well, see, why can't Amy be that subservient?

234
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,820
<9-6,Sheldon>才交媾了一次  心态就变得像女权主义者了
<9-6,Sheldon>She has coitus one time, suddenly she's Gloria Steinem.

235
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,100
<9-6,Sheldon>总之  我想冰淇淋店应该是
<9-6,Sheldon>Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlor

236
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,830
<9-6,Sheldon>结交其他女生的好地方
<9-6,Sheldon>will be a good place to meet other women.

237
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,480
<9-7,Penny>拜托  你极不情愿地
<9-7,Penny>Oh, please, you're barely interested

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,550
<9-7,Penny>和一个女人发生肉体关系
<9-7,Penny>in a physical relationship with one person.

239
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,690
<9-7,Penny>你为什么还要给其他女人带去困惑和失望呢
<9-7,Penny>Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?

240
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,220
<9-8,Sheldon>和艾米的关系  唤醒了我内在的性野兽
<9-8,Sheldon>Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within.

241
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,310
<9-8,Sheldon>现在我看到街上的漂亮姑娘  我就会
<9-8,Sheldon>When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think,

242
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,120
<9-8,Sheldon>像其他男人一样想着"哎哟美女"
<9-8,Sheldon>"Hubba hubba" like any other guy.

243
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,350
<9-9,Penny>你用说这话的嘴亲你的妈妈吗
<9-9,Penny>You kiss your mother with that mouth?

244
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,920
<9-9,Penny>完全没问题
<9-9,Penny>'Cause it's fine.

245
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,410
<10-1,Raj>给你
<10-1,Raj>Here you go.

246
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,000
<10-2,Stuart>谢谢
<10-2,Stuart>Thank you.

247
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,860
<10-3,Raj>我们要干杯吗
<10-3,Raj>Shall we toast?

248
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,470
<10-4,Stuart>敬霍华德和伯纳黛特
<10-4,Stuart>To Howard and Bernadette,

249
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,750
<10-4,Stuart>还有他们从未要我交还的钥匙
<10-4,Stuart>and the house key they never asked me to return.

250
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,120
<10-5,Bernadette>你说你拿回来了
<10-5,Bernadette>You said you got it back.

251
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,230
<10-6,Howard>很明显我说谎了
<10-6,Howard>Well, clearly, I lied.

252
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,210
<10-7,Raj>你的公寓怎么样
<10-7,Raj>So how's your apartment?

253
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,600
<10-8,Stuart>不怎么样  没电了
<10-8,Stuart>Not great. The electricity's out.

254
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,820
<10-9,Raj>你为什么不找人修呢
<10-9,Raj>So why don't you get it fixed?

255
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,890
<10-10,Stuart>我打了电话  他们说  "先交电费"
<10-10,Stuart>I called, and they're like, "Pay your bill!"

256
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,560
<10-11,Raj>如果你需要地方住  可以随时去我家
<10-11,Raj>Of you ever need somewhere to crash, there's always my place.

257
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,320
<10-12,Stuart>不  我不想打扰你
<10-12,Stuart>Oh, no. I don't want to be an inconvenience.

258
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,570
<10-12,Stuart>你有那些女性朋友
<10-12,Stuart>You've got all your lady friends, and...

259
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,400
<10-13,Raj>事实上  我现在单身了
<10-13,Raj>Actually, I'm single now.

260
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,190
<10-13,Raj>什么
<10-13,Raj>What?!

261
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,280
<10-14,Stuart>这是什么时候的事
<10-14,Stuart>When did that happen?

262
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,080
<10-15,Raj>没事  这是选择的结果
<10-15,Raj>It's okay. It's by choice.

263
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,660
<10-15,Raj>她们的选择  所以不好
<10-15,Raj>Well, their choice, and it's not okay.

264
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,510
<10-16,Stuart>抱歉  我不知道
<10-16,Stuart>Oh. Sorry. I didn't know.

265
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,370
<10-17,Raj>没人知道  我觉得太丢人  所以谁都没说
<10-17,Raj>Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn't say anything.

266
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,220
<10-18,Bernadette>他为什么没告诉我们
<10-18,Bernadette>Why wouldn't he tell us?

267
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,750
<10-18,Bernadette>我们是差劲的朋友吗
<10-18,Bernadette>Are we bad friends?

268
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,530
<10-19,Howard>他泡着咱家的热水浴缸喝着咱家的酒
<10-19,Howard>He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.

269
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,700
<10-20,Bernadette>他活该当单身狗
<10-20,Bernadette>Yeah, he deserves to be alone.

270
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,170
<10-21,Stuart>所以你现在重回泡妞阵营了
<10-21,Stuart>So you're back out on the dating scene now?

271
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,810
<10-22,Raj>对  差不多吧
<10-22,Raj>Yeah, yeah, a little.

272
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,910
<10-23,Stuart>肯定有意思  顺利吗
<10-23,Stuart>Oh, that must be fun. How's that going?

273
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,700
<10-24,Raj>我沦落到跟你共浴  糟透了
<10-24,Raj>I'm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.

274
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,360
<11-1,Amy>或许我该向他的如厕时间表低头
<11-1,Amy>Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.

275
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,050
<11-2,Leonard>不  别这样
<11-2,Leonard>No, don't do that.

276
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,850
<11-3,Amy>-你不是低头了吗  -正是
<11-3,Amy>- But you did! - Exactly!

277
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,770
<11-4,Leonard>我不想你重蹈覆辙
<11-4,Leonard>Learn from my mistakes!

278
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,420
<11-4,Leonard>早晨7:18  无论我身在何处
<11-4,Leonard>No matter where I am at 7:18 A.M.,

279
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,920
<11-4,Leonard>都急需找个厕所
<11-4,Leonard>there better be a toilet nearby.

280
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,430
<11-5,Amy>按他的规章制度来  日子就简单很多
<11-5,Amy>It's just so much easier to give him what he wants.

281
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,100
<11-6,Leonard>的确  可想想你的成就
<11-6,Leonard>Oh, true, but think of how much you've accomplished.

282
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,070
<11-6,Leonard>是谁让他不再给零钱消毒的
<11-6,Leonard>Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?

283
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,840
<11-7,Amy>我
<11-7,Amy>Me.

284
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,600
<11-8,Leonard>是谁让他可以往前座置物[手套]柜里
<11-8,Leonard>And who got him to put things other than gloves

285
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,310
<11-8,Leonard>放进除了手套之外的东西
<11-8,Leonard>in the glove compartment?

286
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,740
<11-7,Amy>我
<11-7,Amy>Me.

287
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,400
<11-9,Amy>放的是棒球手套
<11-9,Amy>It was mittens.

288
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,500
<11-10,Leonard>是谁让他尝了火鸡肉热狗
<11-10,Leonard>And who got him to try a turkey dog?

289
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,820
<11-11,Amy>那应该是库萨帕里
<11-11,Amy>That was actually Koothrappali,

290
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,460
<11-11,Amy>但是我让他吐我手上了
<11-11,Amy>but I did let him spit it out in my hand.

291
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,350
<11-12,Leonard>就是  那你怎么能现在放弃呢
<11-12,Leonard>Look, how can you stop now?

292
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,210
<11-12,Leonard>简直就像好不容易等到匹诺曹
<11-12,Leonard>That's like walking out of Pinocchio

293
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,870
<11-12,Leonard>要变成小男孩时离开了他
<11-12,Leonard>right before he becomes a real boy.

294
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,820
<11-12,Leonard>你说得对
<11-12,Leonard>You know, you're right.

295
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,090
<11-13,Amy>我也是这段感情中的当事人
<11-13,Amy>I'm in this relationship, too.

296
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,630
<11-13,Amy>我应该为自己出头
<11-13,Amy>I need to stand up for myself.

297
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,570
<11-14,Leonard>当然了
<11-14,Leonard>Of course you do.

298
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,070
<11-15,Amy>他要是不喜欢  让他自己搬回来
<11-15,Amy>And if he doesn't like it, he can move back here.

299
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,350
<11-16,Leonard>想搬回来也行  就是得先找到好开锁匠
<11-16,Leonard>Oh. He can try. He'd just need a good locksmith.

300
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,220
<12-1,Penny>你准备搭讪哪个
<12-1,Penny>Well, who you gonna hit on?

301
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,960
<12-1,Penny>排我们前面的那个姑娘买了草莓味
<12-1,Penny>The girl in front of us got strawberry.

302
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
<12-1,Penny>你的最爱
<12-1,Penny>That's your favorite.

303
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,910
<12-2,Sheldon>不行  如果我们都喜欢草莓味
<12-2,Sheldon>No. No, if we both like it,

304
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,600
<12-2,Sheldon>那我下半辈子就会每每打开冰箱
<12-2,Sheldon>I'll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going,

305
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,840
<12-2,Sheldon>哀嚎着"草莓味没了"
<12-2,Sheldon>"Aw, no strawberry."

306
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,140
<12-3,Penny>那店员小姐呢
<12-3,Penny>What about the girl behind the counter?

307
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,580
<12-4,Sheldon>她一整天都在挖挖挖
<12-4,Sheldon>Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping.

308
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,090
<12-4,Sheldon>一边胳膊可能会比另一边粗
<12-4,Sheldon>One arm's probably bigger than the other.

309
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,760
<12-5,Penny>有没有这个可能  你压根就不想另觅新欢
<12-5,Penny>Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?

310
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,460
<12-6,Sheldon>你真是明智
<12-6,Sheldon>You are truly wise.

311
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,170
<12-7,Penny>谢谢
<12-7,Penny>Thank you.

312
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,580
<12-8,Sheldon>我本来想说你有着长者的智慧
<12-8,Sheldon>I'd say wise beyond your years,

313
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,930
<12-8,Sheldon>-可你年纪也慢慢接近了  -够了
<12-8,Sheldon>- but you're getting up there. - All right.

314
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,030
<12-9,Penny>说吧  你到底是怎么回事
<12-9,Penny>Come on. What is really going on with you?

315
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,030
<12-10,Sheldon>佩妮  我要给你讲一个
<12-10,Sheldon>Penny, I am going to tell you a story

316
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,590
<12-10,Sheldon>我从来没跟任何人说过的故事
<12-10,Sheldon>that I've never told anyone.

317
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,870
<12-11,Penny>好吧
<12-11,Penny>All right.

318
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,610
<12-12,Sheldon>当时我十三岁
<12-12,Sheldon>I was 13 years old,

319
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,810
<12-12,Sheldon>正值大学休春假
<12-12,Sheldon>and on spring break from college.

320
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,880
<12-13,Penny>没共鸣  继续说
<12-13,Penny>Not relating. Go on.

321
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,340
<12-14,Sheldon>我提早回家
<12-14,Sheldon>I came home early

322
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,690
<12-14,Sheldon>因为他们已经没有能教我的数学了
<12-14,Sheldon>because they ran out of math to teach me.

323
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,660
<12-15,Penny>我懂  他们也没有能教我的数学
<12-15,Penny>Oh, now I'm with ya. Okay.

324
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,790
<12-16,Sheldon>我妈妈当时去参加圣经研读班了
<12-16,Sheldon>My mother was at bible study.

325
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,200
<12-16,Sheldon>我走进房子  本以为没人在家
<12-16,Sheldon>I walked in the house expecting to find it empty,

326
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,150
<12-16,Sheldon>却听到我父母的卧室里有声音传出来
<12-16,Sheldon>and I heard a sound coming from my parents' bedroom.

327
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,700
<12-16,Sheldon>当我打开卧室门
<12-16,Sheldon>When I opened the door,

328
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,240
<12-16,Sheldon>看到了我父亲和另一个女人在"结合"
<12-16,Sheldon>I saw my father having relations with another woman.

329
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,820
<12-17,Penny>-太糟糕了  -我知道
<12-17,Penny>- Oh, that's awful! - I know.

330
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,270
<12-18,Sheldon>所以从此以后我开任何门
<12-18,Sheldon>It's also why I never open a door

331
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,520
<12-18,Sheldon>都需要先敲三次
<12-18,Sheldon>without knocking three times.

332
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,720
<12-18,Sheldon>第一下是按传统礼貌
<12-18,Sheldon>I mean, the first one's traditional,

333
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,710
<12-18,Sheldon>二和三都是给里面的人穿裤子的时间
<12-18,Sheldon>but two and three are for people to get their pants on.

334
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,240
<12-19,Penny>后来你跟你爸怎么样了
<12-19,Penny>Well, what happened with your dad?

335
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,780
<12-20,Sheldon>我们对视了一下  我跑回我的房间
<12-20,Sheldon>We locked eyes, I ran to my room,

336
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,130
<12-20,Sheldon>以后再也没有说过这件事
<12-20,Sheldon>and we never, ever spoke of it.

337
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,610
<12-21,Penny>可怜的小家伙
<12-21,Penny>You poor thing.

338
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,050
<12-22,Sheldon>自从我和艾米住同居后
<12-22,Sheldon>Since Amy and I have been living together,

339
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,130
<12-22,Sheldon>就一直像我父母以前那样争吵
<12-22,Sheldon>we've been bickering like my parents used to.

340
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,920
<12-23,Penny>你是怕会做出跟你爸爸一样的事
<12-23,Penny>And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?

341
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,950
<12-24,Sheldon>对  我需要现在就给她打预防针
<12-24,Sheldon>Yes. I need to prepare her now

342
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,350
<12-24,Sheldon>-省得她日后痛苦  -日后
<12-24,Sheldon>- to save her from pain down the road. - Down the road?

343
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,630
<12-25,Penny>谢尔顿  她只是想跟你用一个牙刷桶
<12-25,Penny>Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you,

344
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,030
<12-25,Penny>而你却跑到冰淇淋店里想把妹
<12-25,Penny>and now you're at an ice cream parlor trying to pick up women!

345
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,970
<12-26,Sheldon>什么事被你这种口气一说  都显得很蠢
<12-26,Sheldon>Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.

346
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,980
<12-27,Penny>宝贝  与其担心未来有可能给她造成的痛苦
<12-27,Penny>Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future,

347
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,160
<12-27,Penny>何不现在去弥补你当下给她的伤害呢
<12-27,Penny>how about trying to fix the pain you're causing her right now?

348
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,450
<12-28,Sheldon>你说得很对
<12-28,Sheldon>I'm sure you're right.

349
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,990
<12-28,Sheldon>我也应该跟你道歉
<12-28,Sheldon>I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.

350
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,310
<12-29,Penny>怎么说
<12-29,Penny>Okay.

351
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,060
<12-30,Sheldon>我这样直接把你剔除在外  去找其他姑娘
<12-30,Sheldon>That must have hurt watching me look for other women

352
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,960
<12-30,Sheldon>你肯定心痛不已吧
<12-30,Sheldon>without ever even considering you.

353
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,370
<12-30,Sheldon>请你一定要理解  我一直把你
<12-30,Sheldon>Please understand that I think of you

354
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,360
<12-30,Sheldon>当我保姆看
<12-30,Sheldon>as more of a nanny.

355
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,930
<12-31,Penny>赶紧把冰淇淋吃完  我送你回家睡觉
<12-31,Penny>Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.

356
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,860
<13-1,Raj>不知道伯纳黛特的宝宝
<13-1,Raj>I wonder if this is what it feels like

357
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,610
<13-1,Raj>现在是不是这种感觉
<13-1,Raj>to be Bernadette's baby.

358
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,740
<13-2,Stuart>不知道  伯纳黛特的宝宝可还没有一个
<13-2,Stuart>I don't know. Bernadette's baby doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet

359
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,690
<13-2,Stuart>可以正中爽点的按摩浴缸
<13-2,Stuart>hitting just the right spot.

360
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,980
<13-3,Howard>我的秘密爽点专用喷头  不是给他的
<13-3,Howard>Those jets are for my secret spot, not his!

361
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,600
<13-4,Bernadette>你在里头都干了些什么
<13-4,Bernadette>What do you do in there?!

362
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,190
<13-5,Howard>干的事叫放松
<13-5,Howard>It's called relaxing,

363
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,520
<13-5,Howard>你只需要知道这些就可以了
<13-5,Howard>and that's all you need to know.

364
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,170
<13-6,Raj>已经很晚了
<13-6,Raj>Well, it's getting late.

365
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,350
<13-6,Raj>我们该回家了吧
<13-6,Raj>Maybe we should head home.

366
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,750
<13-7,Stuart>你说得对
<13-7,Stuart>Yeah, you're probably right.

367
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,960
<13-8,Raj>你不走吗
<13-8,Raj>You coming?

368
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,970
<13-9,Stuart>走  但等我一小会儿
<13-9,Stuart>Yeah, just give me a minute.

369
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,890
<13-10,Raj>为什么
<13-10,Raj>Why?

370
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,590
<13-11,Stuart>就是你穿着泳裤来泡  对吧
<13-11,Stuart>Well, you know how you're wearing a bathing suit?

371
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,730
<13-12,Raj>对啊
<13-12,Raj>Yeah?

372
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,810
<13-13,Stuart>而我跟你恰好相反
<13-13,Stuart>I kind of went the other way.

373
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,330
<13-14,Howard>你们两个混球  自己买浴缸去
<13-14,Howard>You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!

374
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,130
<14-1,Leonard>你觉得如何
<14-1,Leonard>What do you think?

375
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,860
<14-2,Amy>这个位置还不错
<14-2,Amy>It's a nice enough spot.

376
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,570
<14-2,Amy>如果我要为我自己出头
<14-2,Amy>You know, if I'm going to start standing up for myself,

377
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,970
<14-2,Amy>这种事刚好是...
<14-2,Amy>this is exactly the kind of thing...

378
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,150
<14-4,Amy>-我们回来了  -欢迎  欢迎
<14-4,Amy>- We're back! - Oh, hi! Hi!

379
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,070
<14-5,Sheldon>你们好
<14-5,Sheldon>Hello.

380
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,020
<14-6,Leonard>你们怎么样
<14-6,Leonard>How you guys doing?

381
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,740
<14-7,Penny>挺好的
<14-7,Penny>We're doing good.

382
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,170
<14-7,Penny>我想谢尔顿有话要对艾米讲
<14-7,Penny>I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
