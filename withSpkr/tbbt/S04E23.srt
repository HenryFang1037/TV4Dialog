<2-5,Bernadette>悬崖上办婚礼

<2-6,Howard>没什么能比担心摔下去溺死
<2-6,Howard>Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters

56
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,360
<2-6,Howard>更能缓解婚礼前的紧张了
<2-6,Howard>like the thought of falling and drowning.

57
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,100
<2-7,Leonard>你跟你妈妈说
<2-7,Leonard>What did your mother say

61
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,340
<2-9,Howard>其实我想把这事儿编进悼词里
<2-9,Howard>I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.

62
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,950
<2-10,Priya>霍华德  你必须告诉你妈妈
<2-10,Priya>Howard, you've got to tell your mother.

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,810
<2-13,Howard>是啊是啊  而犹太母亲
<2-13,Howard>Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers

70
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,610
<2-13,Howard>一般都任自己的儿子自生自灭的
<2-13,Howard>take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

71
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,420

<3-15,Howard>my mother will swallow her whole

98
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,900
<3-15,Howard>然后像猫头鹰一样把骨头吐出来

<4-7,Howard>Did you talk?

122
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,820
<4-8,Mrs Wolowitz>当然了  你知道吗
<4-8,Mrs Wolowitz>Oh, sure! Did you know she's going to school

123
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,350
<4-8,Mrs Wolowitz>她正在读微生物学呢
<4-8,Mrs Wolowitz>to become a microbiologist?!

124
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,080
<4-9,Howard>不知道  她还真没提过
<4-9,Howard>No, she never mentioned it.

125
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,280
<4-10,Mrs Wolowitz>她肯定提过  是你没注意听
<4-10,Mrs Wolowitz>I bet she did and you didn't listen!

126
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,190
<4-11,Howard>没准吧  那你觉得她怎么样
<4-11,Howard>Yeah, that's probably it. So, what do you think?

127
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,390
<4-11,Howard>你喜欢她吗  她是个好女孩对吧
<4-11,Howard>Do you like her? She's great, huh?

128
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,110
<4-12,Mrs Wolowitz>她是个挺可爱的
<4-12,Mrs Wolowitz>She's a lovely girl!

129
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,760
<4-12,Mrs Wolowitz>超级可爱
<4-12,Mrs Wolowitz>Cute as a button!

130
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,980
<4-13,Howard>听你这么说我就放心了  因为我有事要跟你说
<4-13,Howard>That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.

131
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,620
<4-14,Mrs Wolowitz>最好是好事
<4-14,Mrs Wolowitz>I hope it's good news,

132
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,870
<4-14,Mrs Wolowitz>因为我在厕所里进展可不怎么样  都快郁闷死了
<4-14,Mrs Wolowitz>because I've got nothing but disappointment in here!

133
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,240
<4-15,Howard>我要跟伯纳黛特结婚了
<4-15,Howard>Bernadette and I are getting married.

134
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,880
<4-15,Howard>妈
<4-15,Howard>Ma?

135
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,540
<4-15,Howard>你正忙着使劲呢吗
<4-15,Howard>You too busy bearing down?

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
<4-15,Howard>妈
<4-15,Howard>Ma?

137
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,390
<4-15,Howard>天啊  妈  妈  妈
<4-15,Howard>Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma?

138
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,190
<4-15,Howard>退后点  我要撞门了
<4-15,Howard>Stand back, I'm gonna break the door down!

139
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,060
<4-15,Howard>该死的  妈  救我
<4-15,Howard>Son of a bitch! Ma, help!

140
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,970
<5-2,Sheldon>你好
<5-2,Sheldon>Hello.

141
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,120
<5-3,Penny>好久不见了
<5-3,Penny>Haven't seen you in a while.

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,230
<5-3,Penny>你最近咋样啊
<5-3,Penny>How's it going?

143
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,400
<5-4,Sheldon>除了等着那些致命的有机物
<5-4,Sheldon>Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period

144
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,210
<5-4,Sheldon>沿着我的绒毛组织
<5-4,Sheldon>of the virulent organisms

145
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,970
<5-4,Sheldon>侵入我的血液循环系统外
<5-4,Sheldon>trooping through my microvilli

146
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,970
<5-4,Sheldon>就没啥特别的了
<5-4,Sheldon>into my circulatory system -- hunky-dory.

147
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,520
<5-4,Sheldon>很好笑吗
<5-4,Sheldon>Did I say something amusing?

148
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,020
<5-5,Penny>不知道  也许吧  我完全没听懂你在说什么
<5-5,Penny>I don't know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.

149
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,060
<5-6,Sheldon>这么说你刚才的欢笑声只是为了释放你的紧张情绪
<5-6,Sheldon>So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy

150
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,930
<5-6,Sheldon>没有任何实际意义咯
<5-6,Sheldon>with no semantic content at all?

151
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,480
<5-7,Penny>我的欢笑声  还真是谢尔顿的经典语录啊
<5-7,Penny>My mirth. Classic.

152
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,960
<5-8,Sheldon>我啥时候才能理解
<5-8,Sheldon>Is there a station coming up

153
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,790
<5-8,Sheldon>你这些奇怪的笑声呀
<5-8,Sheldon>where I can board your giggling train of thought?

154
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,460
<5-9,Penny>这没啥大不了的  谢尔顿
<5-9,Penny>It's not a big deal, Sheldon.

155
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,190
<5-9,Penny>只是  自从莱纳德跟拉杰的妹妹在一起之后
<5-9,Penny>It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister,

156
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,090
<5-9,Penny>我就得跟你们保持距离了
<5-9,Penny>I've had to keep my distance.

157
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,450
<5-9,Penny>我就没机会听你的这些胡言乱语了
<5-9,Penny>I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.

158
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,920
<5-10,Sheldon>胡言乱语
<5-10,Sheldon>Jibber-jabber?!

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,380
<5-10,Sheldon>我才不会胡言乱语呢
<5-10,Sheldon>I don't jibber-jabber.

160
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,070
<5-11,Penny>你这段时间上班都忙什么呢
<5-11,Penny>What are you doing at work these days?

161
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,680
<5-12,Sheldon>我在研究弦理论的
<5-12,Sheldon>Oh, I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds

162
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,830
<5-12,Sheldon>时间依赖性
<5-12,Sheldon>in string theory,

163
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,820
<5-12,Sheldon>尤其是量子场论
<5-12,Sheldon>specifically quantum field theory

164
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,930
<5-12,Sheldon>在德西特时空d维空间中的应用
<5-12,Sheldon>in "d-dimensional" de Sitter space.

165
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,950
<5-13,Penny>拜托  这下你总得承认那是胡言乱语了吧
<5-13,Penny>Okay, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.

166
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,710
<5-14,Sheldon>有意思  你知不知道
<5-14,Sheldon>Interesting, do you know

167
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,630
<5-14,Sheldon>胡言乱语这个词是怎么来的
<5-14,Sheldon>where the phrase "jibber-jabber" comes from?

168
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,510
<5-15,Penny>天啊  你就要说一堆关于胡言乱语的
<5-15,Penny>Oh, my God, you're about to jibber-jabber

169
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,390
<5-15,Penny>胡言乱语了
<5-15,Penny>about jibber-jabber.

170
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,520
<5-16,Leonard>霍华德和他妈进医院了
<5-16,Leonard>Howard and his mother are at the hospital.

171
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,220
<5-17,Penny>-快点  咱们走  -天啊  出什么事了
<5-17,Penny>- Come on, we gotta go.  - Oh, my God! What happened?

172
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,860
<5-18,Leonard>不知道  我只是收到短信而已  快点  快走
<5-18,Leonard>I don't know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.

173
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,230
<5-19,Penny>好吧
<5-19,Penny>Okay.

174
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,890
<5-20,Leonard>谢尔顿  走啦
<5-20,Leonard>Sheldon, let's go!

175
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,820
<5-21,Sheldon>去医院吗
<5-21,Sheldon>To a hospital?!

176
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,750
<5-21,Sheldon>那个满是病人的地方
<5-21,Sheldon>Full of sick people?!

177
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,250
<5-21,Sheldon>我才不去呢
<5-21,Sheldon>Oh, I don't think so.

178
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,350
<5-22,Penny>你朋友和他母亲都进医院了
<5-22,Penny>Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there,

179
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,190
<5-23,Sheldon>你非去不可
<5-23,Sheldon>we're going.

180
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,790
<5-23,Sheldon>我不要
<5-23,Sheldon>I can't.

181
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,900
<5-24,Penny>别跟我说你怕细菌啊
<5-24,Penny>Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.

182
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,910
<5-25,Sheldon>不是所有的细菌
<5-25,Sheldon>Not all germs.

183
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,750
<5-25,Sheldon>我只怕那些会让我病死的细菌
<5-25,Sheldon>Just the ones that will kill me.

184
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,920
<5-25,Sheldon>就像是我并不是害怕所有的餐刀
<5-25,Sheldon>It's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives --

185
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,440
<5-25,Sheldon>我只怕那些会捅死我的餐刀
<5-25,Sheldon>just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.

186
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,240
<5-26,Leonard>好吧  那我就跟霍华德说
<5-26,Leonard>Fine, I'll tell Howard you didn't come

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,140
<5-26,Leonard>你没去医院是因为比起他的健康
<5-26,Leonard>because you're more concerned

188
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,000
<5-26,Leonard>你更担心你自己的身体
<5-26,Leonard>about your own well-being than his.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,660
<5-27,Sheldon>我想他是很清楚这一点的
<5-27,Sheldon>I would think he would know that.

190
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,320
<5-28,Penny>好吧  算了吧  你简直不可理喻
<5-28,Penny>Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable.

191
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,270
<5-28,Penny>你买了那么多超级英雄的恤衫
<5-28,Penny>You buy all these superhero T-shirts,

192
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,030
<5-28,Penny>可是到了你该挺身而出
<5-28,Penny>but when it's time for you

193
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,460
<5-28,Penny>做点正确的事的时候
<5-28,Penny>to step up and do the right thing,

194
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,840
<5-28,Penny>你就只会躲在洗衣房里
<5-28,Penny>you just hide in the laundry room.

195
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,830
<5-28,Penny>好吧  我去就是了
<5-28,Penny>Fine, I'll go.

196
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,570
<5-29,Sheldon>不过事先声明
<5-29,Sheldon>Just for the record,

197
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,040
<5-29,Sheldon>我的舅妈露丝就是死在医院里的
<5-29,Sheldon>my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.

198
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,110
<5-29,Sheldon>她去医院探望我舅舅罗杰
<5-29,Sheldon>She went in to visit my Uncle Roger,

199
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,560
<5-29,Sheldon>结果却染上了病  结果一周后就挂了
<5-29,Sheldon>caught something and bit the dust a week later.

200
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,070
<5-29,Sheldon>他俩现在都被装在我妈壁炉架上的
<5-29,Sheldon>The two of them now share a coffee can

201
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,840
<5-29,Sheldon>同一个咖啡罐里
<5-29,Sheldon>on my mother's mantel.

202
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,210
<6-1,Howard>于是我撞开了洗手间的门
<6-1,Howard>So I knocked down the bathroom door,

203
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,580
<6-1,Howard>抬起我那不省人事的母亲
<6-1,Howard>picked up my poor unconscious mother,

204
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,400
<6-1,Howard>把她抱上车
<6-1,Howard>carried her to the car,

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,210
<6-1,Howard>然后像个疯子一样开来了急诊室
<6-1,Howard>and drove like a madman to the emergency room.

206
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,360
<6-2,Bernadette>你真是个英雄  霍华德
<6-2,Bernadette>You're a real hero, Howard.

207
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,860
<6-3,Howard>不  我只是尽了一个儿子应尽的义务而已
<6-3,Howard>No, I did what any son would do.

208
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,580
<6-4,Penny>等一下  你抱起了你母亲
<6-4,Penny>Hang on a second -- you picked up your mother?

209
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,080
<6-4,Penny>她的体重连她自己的双腿都支撑不住
<6-4,Penny>Her own legs are barely able to do that.

210
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,480
<6-5,Howard>都是肾上腺素的作用
<6-5,Howard>I was filled with adrenaline.

211
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,100
<6-5,Howard>就像是母亲为了救出车下的婴儿  可以把车抬起来一样
<6-5,Howard>It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.

212
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,670
<6-6,Penny>我就是这个意思  抬车都比抬你妈容易
<6-6,Penny>Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.

213
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,540
<6-7,Howard>怎么说呢  在我鼓足了勇气
<6-7,Howard>What can I tell you? After I found the courage

214
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,600
<6-7,Howard>提上她的裤子之后  人类就阻挡不了我了
<6-7,Howard>to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.

215
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,960
<6-8,Leonard>你妈妈现在怎样
<6-8,Leonard>So, how is she?

216
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,970
<6-9,Howard>还在作检查  我不知道
<6-9,Howard>They're running tests-- I don't know.

217
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,740
<6-9,Howard>可能是心脏病发作或类似心脏病发作
<6-9,Howard>It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.

218
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,710
<6-10,Penny>有何区别
<6-10,Penny>What's the difference?

219
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,480
<6-11,Sheldon>类似心脏病发作
<6-11,Sheldon>A heart-attack-like event

220
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,450
<6-11,Sheldon>就是指类似发作心脏病的症状
<6-11,Sheldon>is an event that's like a heart attack.

221
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,190
<6-12,Penny>谢谢说明
<6-12,Penny>Thanks for clearing that up.

222
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,230
<6-13,Sheldon>当然  冠状心脏疾患是可治的
<6-13,Sheldon>Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable.

223
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,380
<6-13,Sheldon>真正害死霍华德妈妈的
<6-13,Sheldon>What's more likely going to kill Howard's mother

224
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,840
<6-13,Sheldon>是在这医院每条沟沟壑壑里
<6-13,Sheldon>are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs

225
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,870
<6-13,Sheldon>溃烂着的耐抗生素的超级臭虫们
<6-13,Sheldon>festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.

226
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,490
<6-14,Penny>拜托  你别添乱了
<6-14,Penny>Okay, you're not helping.

227
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,130
<6-15,Sheldon>我不同意
<6-15,Sheldon>Disagree.

228
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,400
<6-16,Leonard>去  那边坐着去
<6-16,Leonard>Go sit over there.

229
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,630
<6-17,Sheldon>我要坐那里   看着更干净
<6-17,Sheldon>I'll sit over there-- it looks cleaner.

230
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,830
<6-18,Leonard>你们家族有心脏病史吗
<6-18,Leonard>Is there a history of heart disease in your family?

231
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,100
<6-19,Howard>我的家族史  整个就是一心脏病史
<6-19,Howard>My family is the history of heart disease.

232
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,040
<6-19,Howard>法国有处洞穴壁画
<6-19,Howard>There's a cave painting in France

233
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,300
<6-19,Howard>画的就是我一老祖宗在这样
<6-19,Howard>of one of my ancestors doing this:

234
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,190
<6-20,Bernadette>那这可能是遗传的咯
<6-20,Bernadette>So it's probably genetic.

235
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,550
<6-21,Howard>可能吧
<6-21,Howard>Well, maybe.

236
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,530
<6-21,Howard>妈妈还听到了些可能让她心烦的消息
<6-21,Howard>Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.

237
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,810
<6-22,Bernadette>什么
<6-22,Bernadette>What?

238
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,370
<6-23,Howard>这不重要
<6-23,Howard>It's not important.

239
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,840
<6-24,Bernadette>说吧  霍华德  我将是你妻子
<6-24,Bernadette>Come on, Howard, I'm going to be your wife.

240
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,370
<6-24,Bernadette>你可以跟我分享任何事
<6-24,Bernadette>You can share anything with me.

241
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,590
<6-25,Howard>你这么想  但并不是的
<6-25,Howard>You'd think that. But no.

242
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,360
<6-26,Bernadette>你告诉她我们要结婚
<6-26,Bernadette>You told her we were going to get married

243
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,160
<6-26,Bernadette>然后她就心脏病发作了吗
<6-26,Bernadette>and she had a heart attack?

244
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,930
<6-27,Howard>你千万别多想
<6-27,Howard>You can't take that personally.

245
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,880
<6-28,Penny>那让她还能怎么想
<6-28,Penny>How else is she supposed to take it?

246
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,430
<6-29,Howard>你只要记住的是
<6-29,Howard>What you've got to keep in mind is that

247
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,290
<6-29,Howard>我爸去世后
<6-29,Howard>ever since my dad left,

248
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,850
<6-29,Howard>我就是我妈妈的整个世界
<6-29,Howard>I've been the whole world to my mother.

249
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,700
<6-29,Howard>她会觉得其他能做到她所不能的
<6-29,Howard>I mean, she'd be threatened by any woman

250
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,450
<6-29,Howard>任何女人  都是威胁
<6-29,Howard>who can give me what she can't.

251
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,420
<6-30,Bernadette>你是指性爱
<6-30,Bernadette>You mean sexual intercourse?

252
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,190
<6-31,Howard>你这么一说  就显得怪怪的
<6-31,Howard>Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.

253
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,190
<6-32,Priya (arriving)>怎么了
<6-32,Priya (arriving)>What happened?

254
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,750
<6-33,Bernadette>霍华德妈妈心脏病发作
<6-33,Bernadette>Howard's mother had a heart attack

255
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,970
<6-33,Bernadette>是因为我跟他上床  而她自己不能
<6-33,Bernadette>because I have sex with him and she can't.

256
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,230
<6-34,Howard>妮妮  等等
<6-34,Howard>Bernie, wait!

257
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,030
<6-35,Sheldon (to Raj)>你载我回家  我就给你一千块
<6-35,Sheldon (to Raj)>I'll give you $1,000 if you'll drive me home.

258
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
<7-1,Priya>你能来医院看霍华德真好
<7-1,Priya>Nice of you to come for Howard.

259
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,040
<7-2,Penny>他是我朋友嘛  应该的
<7-2,Penny>Well, he's my friend. It's what you do.

260
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,200
<7-3,Priya>抱歉  怎么了
<7-3,Priya>I'm sorry, did I miss something?

261
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,470
<7-4,Penny>只是觉得怪怪的
<7-4,Penny>It's just so weird.

262
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,830
<7-4,Penny>霍华德·沃罗威茨是我朋友
<7-4,Penny>Howard Wolowitz is my friend.

263
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,330
<7-4,Penny>有次他想深吻我
<7-4,Penny>You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat

264
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,420
<7-4,Penny>被我打破了鼻子
<7-4,Penny>and I broke his nose.

265
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,790
<7-5,Priya>这比他是你朋友更容易相信点
<7-5,Priya>That's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.

266
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,450
<7-6,Penny>是啊  谁说不是呢
<7-6,Penny>Yeah, tell me about it.

267
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,100
<7-7,Priya>我哥在印度有一大群像他一样的朋友
<7-7,Priya>You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India.

268
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,940
<7-7,Priya>都穿紧身连衣裤戴护目镜
<7-7,Priya>They dressed up in leotards and goggles

269
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,870
<7-7,Priya>并自称"新德里恐龙战队"
<7-7,Priya>and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.

270
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,800
<7-8,Penny>你是指他小时候吗
<7-8,Penny>You mean when he was little.

271
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,570
<7-9,Priya>没你想的那么小
<7-9,Priya>Not as little as you'd want him to be.

272
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,330
<7-10,Penny>这咖啡太难喝了
<7-10,Penny>You know, this stuff is horrible.

273
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,670
<7-10,Penny>想去找看看有没餐厅
<7-10,Penny>You want to see if we can find the cafeteria

274
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,840
<7-10,Penny>-买杯好咖啡吗  -当然
<7-10,Penny>- and get real coffee? - Sure.

275
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,640
<7-11,Priya>我们要去餐厅买咖啡
<7-11,Priya>We're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee.

276
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,720
<7-11,Priya>有人要吗
<7-11,Priya>You want anything?

277
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,140
<7-12,Leonard>我不用了
<7-12,Leonard>I'm fine.

278
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,710
<7-12,Leonard>她们能合得来真好
<7-12,Leonard>That's nice that they're getting along.

279
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,400
<7-13,Raj>你现任和前任女友一起玩
<7-13,Raj>Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together?

280
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,250
<7-13,Raj>没错  对你来说只可能是好事
<7-13,Raj>Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.

281
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,360
<7-14,Leonard>你什么意思啊
<7-14,Leonard>What are you talking about?

282
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,380
<7-15,Raj>其中一位跟你分手了
<7-15,Raj>One of them broke up with you.

283
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,400
<7-15,Raj>你真想她告诉另一位为什么吗
<7-15,Raj>Do you really want her telling the other one why?

284
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,620
<7-16,Leonard>无所谓
<7-16,Leonard>I don't care.

285
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,130
<7-16,Leonard>我又没什么藏着掖着
<7-16,Leonard>I don't have anything to hide.

286
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,120
<7-16,Leonard>很好  很好
<7-16,Leonard>Good, good.

287
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,950
<7-17,Raj>那你就没什么好担心的了
<7-17,Raj>Then you have nothing to worry about.

288
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,440
<7-18,Leonard>对  我一点不担心
<7-18,Leonard>No, I do not.

289
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,630
<7-18,Leonard>你这个卑鄙小人
<7-18,Leonard>You are a mean little man.

290
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,400
<7-19,Raj>你这么以为是因为我父母并不爱我
<7-19,Raj>You'd think it'd be because my parents didn't love me,

291
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,150
<7-19,Raj>但事实上他们非常爱我
<7-19,Raj>but actually they loved me a great deal.

292
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,780
<7-20,Howard>妮妮  绝不是因为你
<7-20,Howard>Bernie, it's not you.

293
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,810
<7-20,Howard>那只是她自以为是
<7-20,Howard>She's just set in her ways.

294
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,460
<7-21,Bernadette>那我们还怎么能在一起  如果
<7-21,Bernadette>How can we be together if the thought of us

295
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,120
<7-21,Bernadette>我们结婚可能会害死你妈啊
<7-21,Bernadette>getting married might kill your mother?

296
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,870
<7-22,Howard>这就是生命的轮回啊  亲爱的
<7-22,Howard>It's the circle of life, sweetie.

297
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,220
<7-22,Howard>未来有天我们儿子结婚  会害死你
<7-22,Howard>One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.

298
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,570
<7-23,Sheldon>霍华德  我得上洗手间
<7-23,Sheldon>Howard, I have to go to the bathroom

299
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,100
<7-23,Sheldon>但没人肯载我回家
<7-23,Sheldon>and no one will take me home.

300
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,920
<7-24,Howard>这里的洗手间怎么了
<7-24,Howard>What's wrong with the bathroom here?

301
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,920
<7-25,Sheldon>这里有肺炎球菌  链球菌  葡萄球菌
<7-25,Sheldon>Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus

302
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,000
<7-25,Sheldon>和其他各种球菌
<7-25,Sheldon>and other assorted coccuses.

303
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,860
<7-26,Howard>谢尔顿  我妈生命垂危
<7-26,Howard>Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed

304
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,570
<7-26,Howard>而我未婚妻正极度悲伤于害她入院
<7-26,Howard>and my fiance is grief-stricken over putting her there.

305
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,670
<7-26,Howard>我才不要载你回家
<7-26,Howard>I'm not taking you home.

306
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,360
<7-27,Sheldon>那你至少能陪我去厕所吗
<7-27,Sheldon>Will you at least go with me to the restroom here,

307
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,250
<7-27,Sheldon>好帮我开个门  冲个尿池
<7-27,Sheldon>so you can open the door and flush the urinal?

308
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,580
<7-28,Howard>不去
<7-28,Howard>No!

309
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,030
<7-29,Sheldon>现在或许是指出真理的最佳时期  霍华德
<7-29,Sheldon>This might be a good time to point out, Howard,

310
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,700
<7-29,Sheldon>友情在一定程度上是需要相互忍让的
<7-29,Sheldon>that friendship requires a certain give and take.

311
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,140
<7-29,Sheldon>先别关门
<7-29,Sheldon>Hold the door.

312
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,200
<7-30,Doctor>沃罗威茨先生
<7-30,Doctor>Mr. Wolowitz?

313
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,660
<7-31,Howard>-她还好吗  -您母亲不是心脏病突发
<7-31,Howard>- Is she okay? - It wasn't a heart attack.

314
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,270
<7-32,Doctor>她现在醒了  在安稳地休息呢
<7-32,Doctor>She's awake, she's resting comfortably--

315
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,750
<7-32,Doctor>我们还在为她做身体检查
<7-32,Doctor>we're still running tests.

316
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,820
<7-33,Howard>我可以进去看她吗
<7-33,Howard>Can I see her?

317
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,080
<7-34,Doctor>其实她有吩咐  原话是这样的
<7-34,Doctor>Actually, she said, and I quote,

318
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,520
<7-34,Doctor>她想"先见那个天主教的小妞"
<7-34,Doctor>she'd "like to see the little Catholic girl first."

319
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,290
<7-35,Bernadette>我  为什么是我
<7-35,Bernadette>Me? Why me?

320
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,160
<7-36,Howard>这个问题犹太人扪心自问了好几个世纪了
<7-36,Howard>Jews have been asking that for centuries.

321
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,300
<7-36,Howard>至今没什么好答案
<7-36,Howard>There's no real good answer.

322
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,450
<7-37,Bernadette>好吧  祝我好运
<7-37,Bernadette>Okay, well, wish me luck.

323
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,960
<7-38,Howard>别担心  没事的
<7-38,Howard>Don't worry, you'll be fine.

324
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,560
<7-38,Howard>先把十字架藏起来
<7-38,Howard>Let's just hide Mr. Cross.

325
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,380
<7-38,Howard>如果那玩意儿碰到她  会烧伤的
<7-38,Howard>If it touches her, it burns.

326
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,210
<7-39,Doctor>-你带一个天主教的女孩回家见你妈  -是的
<7-39,Doctor>- You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother? - Yeah.

328
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,210
<7-41,Doctor>那我给你开点镇静剂吧
<7-41,Doctor>Why don't I write you a prescription for Xanax.

329
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,730
<8-1,Sheldon (exiting while the door is open)>总是完事了
<8-1,Sheldon (exiting while the door is open)>Finally.

331
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,880
<8-1,Sheldon (exiting while the door is open)>隔离室
<8-1,Sheldon (exiting while the door is open)>采用传染性疾病护理程序

332
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,120
<8-1,Sheldon (exiting while the door is open)>这又是哪门子新玩意儿
<8-1,Sheldon (exiting while the door is open)>Oh, what fresh hell is this?

333
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,310
<8-2,Doctor>等等  你不能离开这儿  你已经被感染了
<8-2,Doctor>Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.

334
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,510
<8-3,Sheldon>不  我没有
<8-3,Sheldon>No, I haven't.

335
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,510
<8-3,Sheldon>防护措施做得很好
<8-3,Sheldon>It's all good.

336
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,300
<8-3,Sheldon>你想聊极品老妈这个话题吗
<8-3,Sheldon>You want to talk about crazy mothers,

337
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,890
<9-1,Penny>莱纳德的妈妈对他没表示过半点的认可
<9-1,Penny>Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.

338
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,520
<9-2,Priya>可怜的小家伙
<9-2,Priya>Oh, the poor thing.

339
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,540
<9-3,Penny>所以他才会这么渴望取悦女人
<9-3,Penny>It makes him desperate to please women.

340
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,820
<9-3,Penny>也正是他的小前戏耍不停的原因
<9-3,Penny>That's why the foreplay goes on and on.

341
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,010
<9-4,Priya>的确  对吧
<9-4,Priya>It does, doesn't it?

342
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,420
<9-5,Penny>他好像为了要获得奖励一样
<9-5,Penny>It's like he's trying to win a prize.

343
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,380
<9-5,Penny>佩妮贴心小建议  千万不要打瞌睡
<9-5,Penny>A word of advice-- don't doze off.

344
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,390
<9-5,Penny>不然你都听不见何时结束
<9-5,Penny>You will never hear the end of it.

345
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,500
<9-6,Sheldon (through glass door pane)>救我
<9-6,Sheldon (through glass door pane)>Help me!

346
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,230
<9-6,Sheldon (through glass door pane)>回来
<9-6,Sheldon (through glass door pane)>Come back!

347
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,880
<9-6,Sheldon (through glass door pane)>佩妮
<9-6,Sheldon (through glass door pane)>Penny!

348
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,100
<10-1,Leonard>我跟佩妮一起做过一些事
<10-1,Leonard>There are a couple of things I did with Penny

349
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,960
<10-1,Leonard>听上去可能有点傻  但是
<10-1,Leonard>that might be a little silly, but...

350
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,140
<10-2,Raj>比如
<10-2,Raj>Like what?

351
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,160
<10-3,Leonard>偶尔  在我们上床前
<10-3,Leonard>Every once in a while, before we'd go to bed,

352
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,650
<10-3,Leonard>我会为她表演点小节目
<10-3,Leonard>I'd put on a little show for her.

353
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,460
<10-4,Raj>你的"小节目"是指什么
<10-4,Raj>What do you mean "a show"?

354
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,270
<10-5,Leonard>这个嘛  就是我脱衣服的方式
<10-5,Leonard>Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.

355
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,300
<10-6,Raj>比如伴着音乐
<10-6,Raj>Like, to music?

356
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,950
<10-7,Leonard>如果没音乐  那我看起来不很傻啊
<10-7,Leonard>I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.

357
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,560
<10-8,Raj>那你跳的是脱衣舞咯
<10-8,Raj>So you'd do a striptease?

358
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,290
<10-9,Leonard>我又不是抱着根钢管搔首弄姿
<10-9,Leonard>I wasn't swinging around a pole.

359
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,330
<10-10,Raj>不错  不错
<10-10,Raj>Good, good.

360
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,630
<10-11,Leonard>不过有次我往身上擦了闪粉
<10-11,Leonard>There was one time I put body glitter on.

361
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,740
<10-12,Raj>我觉得你不必为了佩妮会不会
<10-12,Raj>Well, I don't think you have to worry

362
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,480
<10-12,Raj>把这事告诉我妹妹而担心

<10-14,Raj>你的问题在我会不会告诉她
<10-14,Raj>Your big problem is me telling her.

365
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,420
<10-15,Leonard>你还真是个卑鄙小人
<10-15,Leonard>You really are a mean little man.

<10-21,Penny>交换下意见而已
<10-21,Penny>about how you are in the sack.

386
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,830
<10-31,Bernadette>你让我误信她心脏病发是因为我
