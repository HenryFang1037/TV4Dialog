1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,350
<1-2,Leonard>真是太棒了
<1-2,Leonard>That is unbelievable.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,420
<1-2,Leonard>恭喜伯特
<1-2,Leonard>Good for Bert.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,880
<1-3,Howard>靠  麦克阿瑟奖啊
<1-3,Howard>Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,580
<1-3,Howard>俗称天才奖  为纪念约翰·D·麦克阿瑟而命名
<1-3,Howard>50万奖金颁发给在各领域内具有非凡创造性的杰出人士

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,580
<1-4,Raj>没人比他更值得获得这个奖了
<1-4,Raj>Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,340
<1-5,Sheldon>一切都蠢爆了  人家要回家了
<1-5,Sheldon>Everything is stupid and I want to go home.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,990
<1-6,Leonard>这是谢尔顿版本的
<1-6,Leonard>That's Sheldon's way of saying

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,030
<1-6,Leonard>他也为伯特感到骄傲
<1-6,Leonard>he's proud of Bert, too.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,200
<1-7,Howard>而且这奖都不叫做"天才奖"
<1-7,Howard>Hey, it's not even called the "Genius Grant,"

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,870
<1-7,Howard>正确名称叫"麦克阿瑟奖学金"
<1-7,Howard>it's the MacArthur Fellowship.

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,030
<1-8,Sheldon>就像不是《弗兰肯斯坦》
<1-8,Sheldon>Just like it's not Frankenstein,

12
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,320
<1-8,Sheldon>又称《科学怪人》  弗兰肯斯坦常被人误会
<1-8,Sheldon>以为是那怪人的名字  其实那个科学家的名字

13
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,840
<1-8,Sheldon>而是《弗兰肯斯坦的怪物》一样
<1-8,Sheldon>it's "Frankenstein's Monster."

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,760
<1-8,Sheldon>这又让我们联想到后面这位庞大巨怪
<1-8,Sheldon>Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there.

15
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,190
<1-8,Sheldon>要说谁是天才
<1-8,Sheldon>And if anyone's a genius,

16
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,910
<1-8,Sheldon>那也是能联想出刚才那一串的我
<1-8,Sheldon>it's me for the way I brought that full circle.

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,800
<1-9,Leonard>他赢了多少奖金呢
<1-9,Leonard>How much money did he win?

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,240
<1-10,Raj>超过50万美元
<1-10,Raj>Over half a million dollars.

19
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,130
<1-11,Leonard>而且这个奖金没规定得用在研究上
<1-11,Leonard>And he doesn't have to use it for research,

20
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,650
<1-12,Howard>他可以任意支配
<1-12,Howard>he can do whatever he wants with it.

21
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,010
<1-13,Sheldon>他家住天桥底  现在可以盖一座更好的桥住了
<1-13,Sheldon>Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,960
<1-14,Howard>-他过来啦  -是啊
<1-14,Howard>- Here he comes. - Right.

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,850
<1-15,Leonard>保持礼貌
<1-15,Leonard>Be polite.

24
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,960
<1-16,Sheldon>我知道怎么表现好吗
<1-16,Sheldon>I know how to behave.

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,660
<1-17,Howard>是吗
<1-17,Howard>Do you?

26
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,380
<1-18,Raj>恭喜你啊  伯特
<1-18,Raj>Hey, congratulations Bert!

27
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,880
<1-19,Leonard>-恭喜你  -太厉害了
<1-19,Leonard>- Yeah, good for you. - That's amazing.

28
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,570
<1-20,Howard>谢谢
<1-20,Howard>Thanks.

29
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,520
<1-21,Bert>我也跟所有人一样惊讶啊
<1-21,Bert>I was as surprised as anybody.

30
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,970
<1-21,Bert>他们打来通知我得奖了
<1-21,Bert>When they called and told me I won,

31
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,980
<1-21,Bert>我都不相信是真的
<1-21,Bert>I didn't believe them.

32
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,350
<1-21,Bert>然后他们说"你真的赢了"
<1-21,Bert>And then they said, "No, you really won."

33
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,360
<1-21,Bert>我就说"酷啊"
<1-21,Bert>And then I said, "Cool."

34
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,690
<1-22,Sheldon>谁快打给《冰与火之歌》的拖搞作者
<1-22,Sheldon>Someone call George R. R. Martin,

35
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,610
<1-22,Sheldon>这家伙可知道怎么给故事收尾了
<1-22,Sheldon>this guy knows how to finish a story.

36
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,030
<1-23,Bert>我已经越来越会说这故事了
<1-23,Bert>I've gotten pretty good at telling it.

37
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,470
<1-23,Bert>好啦  再见
<1-23,Bert>Well, see ya.

38
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,170
<1-24,Sheldon>还天才呢
<1-24,Sheldon>Some genius.

39
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,590
<1-24,Sheldon>我讽刺了他一番  他都没听出来
<1-24,Sheldon>I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn't even notice.

40
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,570
<1-24,Sheldon>对啊
<1-24,Sheldon>I know,

41
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,000
<1-25,Leonard>你讽刺他的金句可是我这辈子听过最毒的呢
<1-25,Leonard>and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I've ever heard.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,570
<1-26,Sheldon>你这小嘴抹了蜜了
<1-26,Sheldon>Well, aren't you a peach.

52
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,840
<2-1,Sheldon>谁会把自行车随便放在走廊啊
<2-1,Sheldon>Who leaves their bike in the hallway?

53
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,070
<2-1,Sheldon>我要是会骑自行车
<2-1,Sheldon>You know, if I knew how to ride one,

54
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,910
<2-1,Sheldon>我肯定就偷了
<2-1,Sheldon>I'd steal it.

55
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,820
<2-2,Leonard>别理他
<2-2,Leonard>Ignore him,

56
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,210
<2-2,Leonard>他耍脾气是因为地质学的伯特
<2-2,Leonard>he's just cranky because Bert from the geology lab

57
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,400
<2-2,Leonard>赢了笔大奖学金
<2-2,Leonard>won a big grant.

58
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,330
<2-3,Penny>我有在广播上听到他的采访
<2-3,Penny>Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio!

59
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,600
<2-3,Penny>就是颁奖单位通知他获奖时
<2-3,Penny>You know, when they told him he won,

60
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,690
<2-3,Penny>他本来不相信  然后他又相信了
<2-3,Penny>he didn't believe it, but then he did believe it.

61
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,780
<2-3,Penny>真是笑死我了
<2-3,Penny>It was so funny.

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,960
<2-4,Sheldon>这年头谁还听广播啊
<2-4,Sheldon>Who listens to the radio anymore?

63
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,960
<2-5,Amy>伯特在研究岩石中的微生物
<2-5,Amy>Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks

64
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,030
<2-5,Amy>在极端环境下是如何生存的
<2-5,Amy>can survive in extreme environmental conditions.

65
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,510
<2-6,Leonard>有人认为这可能成为
<2-6,Leonard>They say it could be a potential indicator

66
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,940
<2-6,Leonard>其他星球上有无生命的指标
<2-6,Leonard>of life on other planets.

67
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,100
<2-7,Penny>我见过伯特这人
<2-7,Penny>You know what, I've met Bert.

68
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,800
<2-7,Penny>他的存在不就指出了其他星球上有生物吗
<2-7,Penny>Isn't he an indicator of life on other planets?

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,000
<2-8,Sheldon>你以前开这种玩笑都是吐槽我的
<2-8,Sheldon>You used to make those jokes about me.

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,590
<2-8,Sheldon>现在什么事都是伯特这个  伯特那个
<2-8,Sheldon>Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert!

71
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,880
<2-9,Amy>谢尔顿  或许如果你花时间
<2-9,Amy>You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time

72
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,330
<2-9,Amy>真去读读人家的研究成果
<2-9,Amy>to actually read Bert's research,

73
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,210
<2-9,Amy>或许你就不会对人家赢奖这么郁闷
<2-9,Amy>you'd be less bitter about him winning.

74
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,650
<2-10,Sheldon>你是要我去读地质学论文啊
<2-10,Sheldon>You want me to read a geology paper?

75
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,160
<2-11,Amy>说实话  我是想你闭嘴
<2-11,Amy>Honestly, I just want you to be quiet

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,500
<2-11,Amy>可是我身上没糖果了
<2-11,Amy>but I'm all out of taffy.

77
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,750
<3-1,Howard>你在忙吗
<3-1,Howard>You busy?

78
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,220
<3-1,Howard>这边有个人想进来见见你
<3-1,Howard>There's somebody out here who wants to meet you.

<3-3,Howard>remote control Stephen Hawking!

82
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,450
<3-4,Bernadette>你从哪搞来的啊
<3-4,Bernadette>Where did you get that?

83
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,860
<3-5,Howard>在一个旧物箱里发现的
<3-5,Howard>I found him in an old box.

84
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,040
<3-6,Bernadette>你为啥要买这玩意
<3-6,Bernadette>Why would you buy it?

85

<3-7,Howard>我没买
<3-7,Howard>I didn't buy it.

86

<3-13,Howard>His eyes also light up in the dark.

96
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,640
<4-1,Leonard>看他读别人的研究成果总是很好玩
<4-1,Leonard>It's always fun watching him read someone else's work.

97
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,090
<4-2,Penny>感觉就像在翻阅我手机上的表情包
<4-2,Penny>It's like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.

98
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,480
<4-3,Sheldon>为  为啥
<4-3,Sheldon>Ye-- why?

99

100
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,900
<4-3,Sheldon>原来如此
<4-3,Sheldon>Oh, that's why.

101
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,360
<4-4,Amy>听起来像我们交媾的那晚
<4-4,Amy>Sounds like the night we had coitus.

102

<4-5,Sheldon>让我读这东西的人  你们这下高兴了吧
<4-5,Sheldon>I hope you're happy making me read this.

103
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,760
<4-5,Sheldon>伯特的成果非凡
<4-5,Sheldon>Bert's work is remarkable.

104
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,370
<4-5,Sheldon>我现在更不高兴了
<4-5,Sheldon>And I'm more upset than ever.

105
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,830
<4-5,Sheldon>承认这点比有一次我得承认
<4-5,Sheldon>This is worse than when I had to admit that

106
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,880
<4-5,Sheldon>搞笑艺人塞德里克真的很搞笑还不爽
<4-5,Sheldon>Cedric the Entertainer's actually entertaining.

108
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,370
<4-6,Amy>谢尔顿  因为伯特的成果很棒而生气太傻了
<4-6,Amy>Sheldon, it's foolish to be angry that Bert's work has merit.

109
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,370
<4-7,Sheldon>我是生气
<4-7,Sheldon>Yeah, well I-I am angry!

110
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,810
<4-7,Sheldon>而你叫我别生气
<4-7,Sheldon>And you telling me not to be angry

111
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,060
<4-7,Sheldon>让我更生气
<4-7,Sheldon>makes me angry!

112
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,110
<4-7,Sheldon>你知道一遍又一遍
<4-7,Sheldon>And do you know how hearing myself

113
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,160
<4-7,Sheldon>听自己说"生气"这个词让我作何感想吗
<4-7,Sheldon>say the word angry over and over makes me feel?

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,480
<4-9,Leonard>-生气吗  -干嘛多嘴
<4-9,Leonard>- Ooh, a-angry? - What are you doing?

115
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,140
<4-10,Penny>人家知道答案  得意忘形了嘛
<4-10,Penny>I-I-I knew the answer. I got excited.

116
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,260
<4-11,Leonard>伙计  要不我们出去散散步
<4-11,Leonard>Hey, buddy, why don't we go for a walk,

117
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,050
<4-11,Leonard>好让你冷静一下
<4-11,Leonard>so you can calm down.

118
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,880
<4-12,Sheldon>这个主意好
<4-12,Sheldon>That's a good idea.

119
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,710
<4-12,Sheldon>看来现在所有人都能有好主意了
<4-12,Sheldon>I guess everyone's having them now.

120
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,820
<4-13,Leonard>我是想帮你好吗
<4-13,Leonard>Hey, I'm trying to help you.

121
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,740
<4-13,Leonard>好吧
<4-13,Leonard>Fine.

122
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,850
<4-14,Sheldon>你可以走在我前面  帮我吓走鸽子
<4-14,Sheldon>You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.

123
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,180
<4-15,Leonard>就挥挥你的稻草人手  鸽子自然会飞走
<4-15,Leonard>Just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it's not...

124
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,870
<5-1,Howard>拉杰
<5-1,Howard>Okay, Raj,

125
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,920
<5-1,Howard>我要给你看样东西
<5-1,Howard>I'm gonna show you something.

126
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,170
<5-1,Howard>我们俩有一人觉得这玩意冒犯人
<5-1,Howard>Now, one of us thinks it's offensive.

127
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,330
<5-1,Howard>另一人觉得这玩意很好笑
<5-1,Howard>The other thinks it's hilarious

128
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,440
<5-1,Howard>而且创意十足
<5-1,Howard>and a great idea.

129
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,540
<5-1,Howard>但是我不会告诉你
<5-1,Howard>But, I'm not going to tell you

130
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,440
<5-1,Howard>我们俩谁喜欢它
<5-1,Howard>who likes it.

131
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,390
<5-2,Raj>这问题太难了
<5-2,Raj>This is tough.

132
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,880
<5-2,Raj>但我要说
<5-2,Raj>But I'm going to say

133
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,870
<5-2,Raj>喜欢它的人肯定是给我看网上
<5-2,Raj>it's the guy who shows me YouTube videos

134
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,950
<5-2,Raj>人们蛋蛋被各种打到视频的那家伙
<5-2,Raj>of people getting hit in the nuts.

135
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,580
<5-3,Howard>你净瞎说
<5-3,Howard>You're crazy.

136
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,660
<5-3,Howard>我跟霍金共事过
<5-3,Howard>I've worked with Hawking.

137
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,280
<5-3,Howard>他非常有幽默感
<5-3,Howard>He's got a great sense of humor.

138
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,500
<5-3,Howard>我觉得他会喜欢这玩意
<5-3,Howard>And I think he'd like it.

139
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,530
<5-4,Bernadette>好啊  那打给他视频给他看
<5-4,Bernadette>Okay, call him and show him.

140
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,920
<5-4,Bernadette>我谅你不敢
<5-4,Bernadette>I dare you.

141
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,040
<5-5,Howard>打给他当然没问题啊
<5-5,Howard>I have no problem calling him.

142
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,180
<5-6,Bernadette>好啊  那就打吧
<5-6,Bernadette>Fine, then do it.

143
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,140
<5-7,Howard>行  我打
<5-7,Howard>Fine, I will.

144
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,020
<5-8,Bernadette>当你在烦世界上最有名的科学家时
<5-8,Bernadette>While you're bothering the world's most famous scientist,

145
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,510
<5-8,Bernadette>记得一定要给他看看他被卡在
<5-8,Bernadette>be sure to show him how funny he looks

146
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,710
<5-8,Bernadette>我们洗碗机下的样子有多可笑
<5-8,Bernadette>getting stuck under our dishwasher.

147
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,310
<5-9,Raj>这个按钮是做什么的
<5-9,Raj>What's this button do?

148
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,590
<5-10,Remote-control Hawking>先生们  启动轮椅
<5-10,Remote-control Hawking>Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.

149
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,660
<5-10,Remote-control Hawking>经典赛车开场白  原句为
<5-10,Remote-control Hawking>"Gentlemen. Start Your Engines!"

150
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,070
<5-11,Howard>你也在别人蛋蛋被打到时嘲笑人家啊
<5-11,Howard>You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.

151
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,790
<5-12,Raj>我笑是因为那个被打到的人是莱纳德
<5-12,Raj>I laughed because the guy was Leonard.

152
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,950
<6-1,Sheldon>我很佩服你  莱纳德
<6-1,Sheldon>I admire you, Leonard.

153
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,980
<6-2,Leonard>是吗  为什么
<6-2,Leonard>Really, why?

154
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,380
<6-3,Sheldon>你对自己的状态感到满意
<6-3,Sheldon>You're happy with who you are.

155
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,910
<6-3,Sheldon>你不会去羡慕嫉妒其他人
<6-3,Sheldon>You don't get jealous of other people.

156
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,820
<6-3,Sheldon>你没有雄心壮志  也不会被其拖累
<6-3,Sheldon>Instead of being weighed down by ambition,

157
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,310
<6-3,Sheldon>你只是一具飘浮在河上的死尸  随波逐流
<6-3,Sheldon>you just float along like a dead body in a river.

158
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,420
<6-4,Leonard>我为啥就不能接受夸赞就好
<6-4,Leonard>I couldn't just take the compliment.

159
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,370
<6-4,Leonard>还得嘴贱问原因
<6-4,Leonard>I had to ask why.

160
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,860
<6-4,Leonard>我真的理解你现在的感受
<6-4,Leonard>You know, I do understand what you're feeling.

161
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,410
<6-4,Leonard>我哥哥和姐姐的成就
<6-4,Leonard>My brother and sister's accomplishments

162
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,290
<6-4,Leonard>一直让我抬不起头
<6-4,Leonard>have always been held over my head.

163
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,130
<6-5,Sheldon>那你是怎么处理的
<6-5,Sheldon>How did you deal with it?

164
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,750
<6-6,Leonard>我直到上大学才不尿床
<6-6,Leonard>I wet the bed until college,

165
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,860
<6-6,Leonard>但我觉得这不算是个好的解决方法
<6-6,Leonard>but I don't think that's a quality fix.

166
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,250
<6-7,Sheldon>我无法相信自己被一个地质学家超越了
<6-7,Sheldon>I can't believe I was surpassed by a geologist.

167
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,330
<6-7,Sheldon>我是说
<6-7,Sheldon>I mean...

168
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,650
<6-7,Sheldon>石头啊
<6-7,Sheldon>rocks!

169
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,970
<6-7,Sheldon>他研究的是石头
<6-7,Sheldon>He studies rocks!

170
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,650
<6-7,Sheldon>石头要真有这么棒  为啥剪刀石头布会输给布
<6-7,Sheldon>If rock is so great, how come paper beats it?

171
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,260
<6-7,Sheldon>莱纳德  我有一股冲动想把这石头扔出去
<6-7,Sheldon>Leonard, I'm having a primal urge to throw this rock.

172
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,430
<6-7,Sheldon>扔吧
<6-7,Sheldon>Do it.

173
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,150
<6-8,Leonard>把它想象成你的气愤
<6-8,Leonard>Visualize it as your anger

174
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,740
<6-8,Leonard>然后用力将它扔出你的人生
<6-8,Leonard>a-and-and toss it out of your life.

175
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,340
<6-9,Sheldon>或许我真会扔
<6-9,Sheldon>Perhaps I will.

176
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,390
<6-9,Sheldon>这块石头
<6-9,Sheldon>This rock

177
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,100
<6-9,Sheldon>封装了我所有的负面情绪
<6-9,Sheldon>encapsulates all my negative emotions.

178
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,280
<6-9,Sheldon>我会将你抛得远远的
<6-9,Sheldon>I will cast you far away.

179
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,040
<6-9,Sheldon>你被抛出天际时  可以顺便砸死只鸽子
<6-9,Sheldon>Feel free to take out a pigeon while you're at it.

180
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
<6-10,Leonard>让它飞出天际吧
<6-10,Leonard>Let it fly.

181
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,290
<7-2,Amy>怎么回事
<7-2,Amy>What happened?

182
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,970
<7-3,Sheldon>我试图释放我的气愤
<7-3,Sheldon>I tried to let go of anger

183
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,870
<7-3,Sheldon>结果扔石头砸到我的脚了
<7-3,Sheldon>and threw a rock into my foot!

184
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,670
<7-4,Leonard>然后他更生气  用另一只脚
<7-4,Leonard>Then he got more angry and kicked the rock

185
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,370
<7-4,Leonard>-去踹那块石头  -搞毛啊
<7-4,Leonard>- with his other foot. - Wha--?

186
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,840
<7-5,Penny>你又是怎么回事
<7-5,Penny>And what happened to you?

187
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
<7-6,Leonard>我狂笑不止
<7-6,Leonard>Oh, I laughed so hard,

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,520
<7-6,Leonard>鼻子的血管都笑破了一根  没事啦
<7-6,Leonard>I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It's fine.

189
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,940
<7-7,Amy>嫉妒别人就算了
<7-7,Amy>You know, it's one thing to be envious,

190
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,790
<7-7,Amy>可你现在还自残
<7-7,Amy>but now you're injuring yourself.

191
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,050
<7-7,Amy>这事必须得打住
<7-7,Amy>It has to stop.

192
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,590
<7-8,Leonard>不过如果你要再自残
<7-8,Leonard>Although if you are gonna do it again,

193
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,290
<7-8,Leonard>麻烦一定要告诉我  我好拍下来
<7-8,Leonard>please let me know, so I can get it on video.

194
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
<7-8,Leonard>谢尔顿
<7-8,Leonard>You know, Sheldon,

195
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,020
<7-9,Amy>别老关注伯特拥有什么
<7-9,Amy>instead of fixating on what Bert has,

196
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,870
<7-9,Amy>你应该感恩自己人生拥有的美好事物
<7-9,Amy>you should appreciate all of the good things in your life.

197
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,410
<7-9,Amy>你拥有爱

<7-9,Amy>you're in good health,

199
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,590
<7-9,Amy>你还拥有一个栖身之所
<7-9,Amy>you've got a roof over your head.

200
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,180
<7-10,Sheldon>是啊  但这些你也有
<7-10,Sheldon>Yeah, but you've got all those things,

201
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,540
<7-10,Sheldon>也没人争着排队想成为你啊
<7-10,Sheldon>and no one's lining up to be you.

202
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,920
<7-11,Amy>谁想来试试
<7-11,Amy>Anybody else want to try?

203
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,830
<7-11,Amy>我再去泡点茶
<7-11,Amy>I'm gonna go make some more tea

204
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,170
<7-11,Amy>顺便质疑下我的人生选择
<7-11,Amy>and question my life choices.

205
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,160
<7-12,Leonard>你去吧
<7-12,Leonard>You're up.

206
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,230
<7-13,Penny>谢小妹妹  老娘快没耐心了  别再唧唧歪歪
<7-13,Penny>This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off!

207
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,890
<7-14,Sheldon>你真的觉得这么乱叫我有用吗
<7-14,Sheldon>Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?

208
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,350
<7-15,Penny>有啊
<7-15,Penny>I do!

209
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,130
<7-15,Penny>你的人生很好了  你个老屁孩
<7-15,Penny>Your life is fine, you big baby!

210
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,180
<7-16,Sheldon>或许你说得对
<7-16,Sheldon>Maybe you're right.

211
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,770
<7-17,Amy>不是吧
<7-17,Amy>Really?!

212
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,880
<7-18,Leonard>不知能否安慰到你
<7-18,Leonard>If it helps,

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,950
<7-18,Leonard>但我也在质疑你的人生选择了
<7-18,Leonard>I'm questioning your life choices, too.

214
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,940
<7-19,Sheldon>谢谢  佩妮
<7-19,Sheldon>Thank you, Penny.

215
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,580
<7-19,Sheldon>我就是需要提醒我自己
<7-19,Sheldon>You know, I just need to keep reminding myself

216
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,280
<7-19,Sheldon>伯特的成功并不代表我的失败
<7-19,Sheldon>that Bert's success is not my failure.

217
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,210
<7-20,Penny>这就对啦
<7-20,Penny>There you go.

218
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,890
<7-21,Sheldon>而且像他这样巨型的身材
<7-21,Sheldon>And that men of his large stature

219
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,770
<7-21,Sheldon>也更容易感染上各种各样的致命病症
<7-21,Sheldon>are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.

220
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,930
<7-20,Penny>这就...对啦...
<7-20,Penny>There you go...

221
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,050
<8-1,Amy>什么事
<8-1,Amy>What's up?

222
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,850
<8-2,Howard>我在做一个快速调查
<8-2,Howard>I'm conducting a quick survey.

223
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,260
<8-2,Howard>你觉得这个向伟人致敬的
<8-2,Howard>Do you think this respectful

224
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,480
<8-2,Howard>集可敬与可爱为一体的小玩意
<8-2,Howard>and loving tribute to a great man

225
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,440
<9-1,Howard>是低级趣味吗
<9-1,Howard>is in poor taste?

226
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,510
<8-3,Amy>没错
<8-3,Amy>Yep.

227
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,080
<9-1,Howard>你觉得这个算低级趣味吗
<9-1,Howard>Do you think this is in poor taste?

228
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,810
<9-2,Leonard>这玩意可以打转或耍把戏吗
<9-2,Leonard>Does it spin around and do tricks?

229
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,560
<9-3,Howard>都可以
<9-3,Howard>Yeah!

230
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,860
<9-4,Leonard>那就是低级趣味
<9-4,Leonard>Then yeah.

231
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,210
<9-4,Leonard>你怎么看
<9-4,Leonard>What do you think?

232
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,940
<10-1,Howard>太好玩了
<10-1,Howard>That is hilarious!

233
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,630
<10-2,Barry>把遥控器给我
<10-2,Barry>Give me the remote control.

234
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,270
<10-2,Barry>我要把他开到女厕所去
<10-2,Barry>I want to drive him into the girls' restroom.

235
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,010
<10-3,Howard>结论已出  这不是个好玩意
<10-3,Howard>All right, we're done. It's offensive.

236
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,550
<11-1,Sheldon>下午好  各位
<11-1,Sheldon>Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.

237
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,650
<11-2,Howard>你心情不错啊
<11-2,Howard>You're in a good mood.

238
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,300
<11-3,Sheldon>新的一天已降临  我有了新的世界观
<11-3,Sheldon>Well, it's a new day. I have a new outlook.

239
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,380
<11-3,Sheldon>我发现
<11-3,Sheldon>You know, I realized

240
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,670
<11-3,Sheldon>我不用关心别人的事
<11-3,Sheldon>I don't need to worry about other people.

241
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,160
<11-3,Sheldon>我只需要多把心思花在自己身上
<11-3,Sheldon>I just need to think more about myself.

242
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,670
<11-4,Leonard>天  我们要如何习惯全新的你
<11-4,Leonard>Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?

243
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,860
<11-5,Raj>我很高兴你能放下  并向未来前进
<11-5,Raj>Well, I'm glad to see you moving forward.

244
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,820
<11-6,Sheldon>伯特的研究做得不错
<11-6,Sheldon>Bert did quality research.

245
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,390
<11-6,Sheldon>他受到表彰也是理所当然的
<11-6,Sheldon>And he deserves whatever accolades he receives.

246
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,700
<11-7,Howard>怎么回事
<11-7,Howard>What is going on?

247
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,390
<11-7,Howard>你昨晚升级了他这机器人的软件吗
<11-7,Howard>Did you upgrade his software last night?

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,420
<11-8,Leonard>他这是开启了自主学习模式
<11-8,Leonard>I think he might be learning on his own.

249
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,750
<11-9,Raj>看来机器人大叛乱指日可待
<11-9,Raj>Then the robot uprising has begun.

259
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,910
<11-13,Bert>最近我听了好多类似的话
<11-13,Bert>I've been hearing that a lot.

260
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,100
<11-13,Bert>自从我得奖  大家都夸我棒棒哒
<11-13,Bert>Ever since I won, people think I'm great.

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,570
<11-14,Sheldon>好吧  仅此一次
<11-14,Sheldon>Well, just this once,

262
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,200
<11-14,Sheldon>你可以把我和大家混为一谈
<11-14,Sheldon>you can count me as people, too.

263
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,490
<11-15,Bert>作为麦克阿瑟奖学金获得者
<11-15,Bert>You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner,

264
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,850
<11-15,Bert>我可以提名下一届的候选人
<11-15,Bert>I'm allowed to nominate someone for next year.

265
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,500
<11-15,Bert>真的吗
<11-15,Bert>Really?

266
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,950
<11-16,Sheldon>我还不知道这件事呢
<11-16,Sheldon>I didn't know that.

267
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,410
<11-17,Bert>我想了一下
<11-17,Bert>So I was thinking, you know,

268
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,550
<11-17,Bert>工程师好像一直不受重视
<11-17,Bert>engineers don't get a lot of respect.

269
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,030
<11-17,Bert>你朋友霍华德有在研究什么有趣的东西吗
<11-17,Bert>Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?

270
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,800
<11-18,Sheldon>我  我不确定
<11-18,Sheldon>You know, I-I'm not sure.

271
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,980
<11-18,Sheldon>你应该去问他
<11-18,Sheldon>You know, you'd have to ask him.

272
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,890
<11-19,Leonard>失陪一下
<11-19,Leonard>Excuse me.

273
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,570
<11-18,Sheldon>莱纳德  我又伤了自己
<11-18,Sheldon>Leonard! I hurt myself again.

274
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,050
<11-19,Leonard>不好意思  我得去拍点照片了
<11-19,Leonard>Excuse me, I-I have to go take some pictures.

275
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,140
<12-1,Amy>真不敢相信你居然用头去撞饮水器
<12-1,Amy>I can't believe you head-butted a water fountain.

276
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,900
<12-2,Sheldon>不  我本打算一拳砸在饮水器上
<12-2,Sheldon>No, I went to punch the water fountain,

277
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,230
<12-2,Sheldon>结果踩到饮水器前一滩水滑倒
<12-2,Sheldon>slipped in water in front of the water fountain,

278
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,850
<12-2,Sheldon>才一头撞上饮水器
<12-2,Sheldon>and hit my head on the water fountain.

279
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,930
<12-3,Bernadette>我真想象不出你暴力的样子
<12-3,Bernadette>I can't imagine you being violent.

281
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,290
<12-4,Leonard>也没那么难了  想象一下"三个臭皮匠"的表演
<12-4,Leonard>It's not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges,

282
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,970
<12-4,Leonard>然后去掉两个臭皮匠
<12-4,Leonard>and then take away two stooges.

283
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,240
<12-5,Sheldon>我对自己太失望了
<12-5,Sheldon>I'm so disappointed in myself.

284
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,620
<12-5,Sheldon>嫉妒真是毫无逻辑可言
<12-5,Sheldon>Jealousy is completely illogical.

285
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,120
<12-6,Raj>这是人类的正常感情  谢尔顿
<12-6,Raj>It's a human emotion, Sheldon.

286
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,790
<12-6,Raj>每个人都会嫉妒
<12-6,Raj>Everyone gets jealous.

287
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,330
<12-6,Raj>我就很嫉妒莱纳德和佩妮
<12-6,Raj>I'm jealous of Leonard and Penny

288
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,210
<12-6,Raj>霍华德和伯纳黛特之间
<12-6,Raj>and Howard and Bernadette

289
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,140
<12-6,Raj>相亲相爱的关系
<12-6,Raj>for being in such happy relationships.

290
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,100
<12-7,Amy>不嫉妒我和谢尔顿吗
<12-7,Amy>What about me and Sheldon?

291
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,780
<12-8,Raj>有啦有啦
<12-8,Raj>Sure.

292
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,380
<12-9,Leonard>我一直都很嫉妒拉杰
<12-9,Leonard>I've always been jealous of how much money

293
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,010
<12-9,Leonard>家底丰厚
<12-9,Leonard>Raj's family has.

294
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,290
<12-10,Raj>谢谢夸奖  家底丰厚的好处
<12-10,Raj>Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things,

295
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,060
<12-10,Raj>除了买买买  就是炫炫炫
<12-10,Raj>that is the best part about having money.

296
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,470
<12-11,Amy>自从我认识了佩妮
<12-11,Amy>Ever since I met Penny,

297
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,540
<12-11,Amy>我就一直嫉妒她的美貌
<12-11,Amy>I've been envious of her looks.

298
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,350
<12-12,Penny>谢谢
<12-12,Penny>Aw, thank you.

299
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,030
<12-13,Amy>所以你剪短发时我才笑得合不拢嘴
<12-13,Amy>That's why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.

300
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,590
<12-14,Penny>什么
<12-14,Penny>What?!

301
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,810
<12-15,Amy>你懂我的意思
<12-15,Amy>You know what I mean.

302
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,240
<12-15,Amy>虽然你依然美丽  但更像是
<12-15,Amy>You were still hot, but more like a

303
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,850
<12-15,Amy>"那位美女是疯了才剪短发吧"的那种美
<12-15,Amy>"Why'd that hot girl cut off all her hair?" hot.

304
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,590
<12-16,Penny>你喜欢我的短发造型吧
<12-16,Penny>You liked my short hair, right?

305
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,000
<12-17,Leonard>是...我挺喜欢的
<12-17,Leonard>Yeah... I loved it.

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,170
<12-17,Leonard>爱你  爱你的秀发
<12-17,Leonard>Love you, love the hair,

307
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,670
<12-17,Leonard>咱们换个话题吧
<12-17,Leonard>would love to change the subject.

308
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,210
<12-18,Penny>说真的  你们都不喜欢吗
<12-18,Penny>Seriously, none of you liked it?

309
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,950
<12-19,Bernadette>我觉得你很勇敢
<12-19,Bernadette>I thought it was brave.

310
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,230
<12-19,Bernadette>这算是喜欢吗
<12-19,Bernadette>Does that count as liking it?

311
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,160
<12-20,Penny>那怎么没人说起
<12-20,Penny>You know, how come nobody's talking about

312
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,150
<12-20,Penny>霍华德的傻逼发型呢
<12-20,Penny>Howard's dopey haircut?

313
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,480
<12-21,Bernadette>我觉得他挺可爱呀
<12-21,Bernadette>I think he looks cute.

314
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,500
<12-22,Howard>我觉得你也很可爱
<12-22,Howard>And I think you're cute.

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,430
<12-23,Raj>我觉得你俩都好可爱
<12-23,Raj>I think you're both cute.

316
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,290
<12-24,Penny>我觉得我烦死你们这群书呆子了
<12-24,Penny>I think I hate all of you nerds.

317
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,430
<13-1,Sheldon>抱歉  我走得太慢了
<13-1,Sheldon>Sorry I'm moving slowly.

318
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,640
<13-2,Leonard>没事
<13-2,Leonard>Oh, I don't mind.

319
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,980
<13-2,Leonard>要是你现在能从兜里掏出颗奶油硬糖
<13-2,Leonard>If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket,

320
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,760
<13-2,Leonard>那就真是和跟我奶奶散步一模一样了
<13-2,Leonard>it would be like I'm walking with my grandma.

321
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,190
<13-3,Sheldon>不是吧
<13-3,Sheldon>Oh, no.

323
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,330
<13-3,Sheldon>你看...  纪念牌
<13-3,Sheldon>Did you... A plaque?

324
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,040
<13-3,Sheldon>没人想看这玩意儿
<13-3,Sheldon>Nobody wants to see this.

325
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,130
<13-4,Leonard>把"纪念牌"这词换成"跨种族伴侣"
<13-4,Leonard>Well, change "Plaque" to "Mixed-race couple"

326
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,530
<13-4,Leonard>你就是我奶奶无疑
<13-4,Leonard>and you are my grandma.

327
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,250
<13-5,Sheldon>我再也受不了了
<13-5,Sheldon>I can't take this anymore.

328

<13-7,Sheldon>伯特
<13-7,Sheldon>Bert?

332
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,130
<13-7,Sheldon>我们得谈谈
<13-7,Sheldon>We need to talk.

333
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,790
<13-8,Bert>你这是怎么搞的
<13-8,Bert>What happened to you?

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,410
<13-9,Sheldon>石头  石头  饮水器
<13-9,Sheldon>Rock, rock, water fountain.

335
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,280
<13-9,Sheldon>这事说起来并不光彩
<13-9,Sheldon>I am not proud of this.

336
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,530
<13-9,Sheldon>但我最近一直在嫉妒你的成功
<13-9,Sheldon>But I have been envious of your recent success.

337
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,490
<13-10,Bert>我得了麦克阿瑟奖
<13-10,Bert>Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant,

338
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,180
<13-10,Bert>大家都开始嫉妒我
<13-10,Bert>everyone's jealous of me.

339
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,710
<13-10,Bert>等我把视力激光矫正手术做了  就别无所求了
<13-10,Bert>Once I get Lasik, I'll be out of things to wish for.

340
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,920
<13-11,Sheldon>我是希望通过向你坦白我的弱点
<13-11,Sheldon>I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you,

341
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,850
<13-11,Sheldon>卸下我心中的重担
<13-11,Sheldon>I'd somehow be unburdened.

342
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,940
<13-12,Bert>-轻松了吗  -没有
<13-12,Bert>- Is it working? - No.

343
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,000
<13-13,Sheldon>现在弱点被你知道了
<13-13,Sheldon>Now that you know my weakness,

344
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,250
<13-13,Sheldon>我对你的恨意更强烈了
<13-13,Sheldon>I hate you more than ever.

345
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,080
<13-14,Bert>我们俩都很聪明
<13-14,Bert>Well, you know, we're both pretty smart.

346
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,550
<13-14,Bert>要是我们能一起想
<13-14,Bert>I bet if we put our heads together,

347
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,000
<13-14,Bert>说不定能想出个办法呢
<13-14,Bert>we could come up with a solution.

348
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,860
<13-15,Sheldon>我们  等等
<13-15,Sheldon>We... Hang on.

350
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,920
<13-15,Sheldon>敌人的敌人就是朋友
<13-15,Sheldon>Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend.

351
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,420
<13-15,Sheldon>现在  我最大的敌人是我自己
<13-15,Sheldon>And right now, I'm my own worst enemy.

352
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,360
<13-15,Sheldon>也就是说  你是我朋...
<13-15,Sheldon>That makes you my fr--

353

<13-16,Bert>Great.

355
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,610
<13-16,Bert>既然我们是朋友了  要不要试试
<13-16,Bert>Now that we're friends, want to see if we can

356
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,390
<13-16,Bert>去搞两张《艾伦秀》的观众入场券

<13-18,Bert>谢尔顿  等等
<13-18,Bert>Sheldon... wait.

<13-18,Bert>你可以高兴的事有很多
<13-18,Bert>You know, you've got a lot to be happy about.

360
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,660
<13-18,Bert>在你的领域里  你是最棒的
<13-18,Bert>You're at the top of your field,

<13-19,Sheldon>过去你曾经喜欢过她
<13-19,Sheldon>In the past, you've professed feelings for her.

365
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,520
<13-19,Sheldon>看着我拥有她  而你却望而不得
<13-19,Sheldon>Does it eat you up inside

366
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
<13-19,Sheldon>心里是不是苦死了
<13-19,Sheldon>that I have her and you don't?

367
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,180
<13-20,Bert>以前是
