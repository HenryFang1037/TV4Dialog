1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,020
<3-13,Amy>《生活大爆炸》前情提要
<3-13,Amy>Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,950
<3-13,Amy>我也不需要纠结这事
<3-13,Amy>There's no point in dwelling on it.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,420
<3-13,Amy>借用一句瓦肯人的俗语
<3-13,Amy>As the Vulcans say,

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,150
<7-1,Tall British Dave>"人已杀  你无力还命"[瓦肯语]
<7-1,Tall British Dave>"Kup-fun-tor ha'kiv na'ish du stau."

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,330
<10-19,Raj>-你懂他的意思吗  -不懂
<10-19,Raj>- Do you know what that means? - No.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,210
<10-20,Sheldon>你说的是实话吗
<10-20,Sheldon>Are you telling the truth?

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,780
<10-21,Girl>非也[瓦肯语]
<10-21,Girl>Nersh.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,740
<6-2,Howard>这一切都太荒唐了  总是为艾米的事伤心
<6-2,Howard>This is ridiculous-- being upset about Amy all the time

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,460
<6-3,Raj>不能解决任何问题
<6-3,Raj>isn't accomplishing anything.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,040
<5-4,Penny>如果我想解决这件事
<5-4,Penny>If I want to resolve this situation,

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,570
<6-3,Raj>我就要行动起来
<6-3,Raj>then I need to take action.

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,440
<6-4,Sheldon>你要干什么
<6-4,Sheldon>What are you gonna do?

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,010
<6-5,Howard>我要去找她  向她求婚
<6-5,Howard>I'm going to find her and ask her to marry me.

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,010
<6-6,Sheldon>如果她答应了
<6-6,Sheldon>And if she says yes,

15
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,820
<6-7,Raj>我们就把这事彻底忘掉  重新开始
<6-7,Raj>we can put this behind us and resume our relationship.

16
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,310
<6-8,Howard>如果她不肯答应
<6-8,Howard>And if she says no...

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,780
<6-8,Howard>那她就可以去自尽了[瓦肯语]
<6-8,Howard>well, then she can just ponfo miran.

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,180
<6-8,Howard>他不是真心的
<6-8,Howard>He didn't mean that.

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,840
<6-8,Howard>你帮谢尔顿做早饭真是太有爱了
<6-8,Howard>I think it's so adorable you're making Sheldon breakfast.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,470
<6-8,Howard>他现在很难过嘛
<6-8,Howard>Well, he's having a rough time.

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,840
<6-8,Howard>艾米伤了他的心
<6-8,Howard>Amy broke his heart,

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,250
<6-8,Howard>录《神秘博士》时录少了最后一分钟
<6-8,Howard>the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who...

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,220
<6-8,Howard>回家时还被乌鸦跟踪
<6-8,Howard>that crow followed him home.

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,170
<6-8,Howard>你不怕在燕麦粥日做法式吐司会出事吗
<6-8,Howard>Aren't you worried you're making French toast on oatmeal day?

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,920
<6-8,Howard>你看这是啥  不就是一锅燕麦粥吗
<6-8,Howard>Ah, well, what's this? A pot of oatmeal?

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,590
<6-8,Howard>或者应该谢谢你  改称它为"我真牛逼粥"
<6-8,Howard>Or, thanks to you, what I will now call "Gloatmeal."

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,800
<6-8,Howard>我可不想跟它沾边
<6-8,Howard>Oh, I don't want credit for that.

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,440
<1-1,Penny>霍夫斯塔德博士贤伉俪
<1-1,Penny>Oh, Dr. And Mrs. Hofstadter,

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,920
<1-2,Leonard>在这美好的早晨很高兴见到两位
<1-2,Leonard>lovely to see you this fine morning.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,000
<1-3,Penny>你心情很好啊
<1-3,Penny>You're in a good mood.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,440
<1-4,Leonard>的确是的
<1-4,Leonard>Yeah, I am indeed.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,400
<1-5,Penny>我已经决定了
<1-5,Penny>I have decided,

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,750
<1-6,Sheldon>与其为艾米的事伤神伤心
<1-6,Sheldon>instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy,

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,100
<1-7,Leonard>不如抓紧时间为自己找个新女伴
<1-7,Leonard>it is time that I find myself a new female companion.

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,490
<1-8,Sheldon>那挺好啊
<1-8,Sheldon>Oh. Good for you.

37
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,730
<1-9,Penny>这想法怎么来的
<1-9,Penny>What brought this on?

38
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,480
<1-10,Leonard>我意识到了  当艾米在我身边时
<1-10,Leonard>I realized something-- when Amy was in my life,

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,270
<1-11,Sheldon>我过度专注于工作而忽略了她
<1-11,Sheldon>I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.

40
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,090
<1-12,Penny>你不想对下一个女人重蹈覆辙
<1-12,Penny>And you don't want to make the same mistake with the next woman.

41
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,030
<1-13,Sheldon>不  所以我需要一个新女人来被我忽略
<1-13,Sheldon>No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore

42
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,340
<1-13,Sheldon>好让我再次过度专注于工作
<1-13,Sheldon>so I can hyper-focus on my work again.

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,790
<1-14,Leonard>我做了法式吐司棒
<1-14,Leonard>Hey, I made French toast sticks.

44
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,190
<1-15,Sheldon>燕麦粥日做这个吗
<1-15,Sheldon>On oatmeal day?

45
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,190
<1-16,Leonard>我也做了燕麦粥哦
<1-16,Leonard>Ah, I also made oatmeal.

46
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,540
<1-17,Sheldon>对于要猎艳的男人来说  太容易长胖了
<1-17,Sheldon>Ooh, that's a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl.

47
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,880
<1-17,Sheldon>还是你吃吧  你结婚了
<1-17,Sheldon>You know what? You eat it; you're married--

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,030
<1-17,Sheldon>长成啥样都无所谓了
<1-17,Sheldon>it doesn't matter what you look like.

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,310
<1-18,Penny>千万别听一个用鞋子扔乌鸦的人的建议
<1-18,Penny>Don't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.

50
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,470
<1-18,Penny>翻译：大变态色色哒赛  小变态萌萌哒猫
<1-18,Penny>猫中之王  别扭大菜

60
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,540
<2-1,Sheldon>谢谢你们抽空来  先生们
<2-1,Sheldon>Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.

61
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,400
<2-2,Howard>小意思
<2-2,Howard>No problem.

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,330
<2-3,Raj>怎么了
<2-3,Raj>So what's up?

63
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,360
<2-4,Sheldon>是你们两位为我找到艾米·菲拉·福勒
<2-4,Sheldon>Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,250
<2-4,Sheldon>现在我在寻觅我下一任女朋友
<2-4,Sheldon>Now that I'm looking for my next girlfriend,

65
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,520
<2-4,Sheldon>所以我觉得
<2-4,Sheldon>it seemed only logical

66
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,160
<2-4,Sheldon>只有再度请你们出手才合理
<2-4,Sheldon>that I employ your services once again.

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,860
<2-5,Howard>她伤了你的心  你真的能再战了吗
<2-5,Howard>Y-You sure you're up for that? She did hurt you.

68
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,860
<2-5,Howard>没事的  不算什么
<2-5,Howard>Oh, no, it's all right.

69
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,090
<2-6,Sheldon>我跟艾米在一起的时光就像水果口香糖
<2-6,Sheldon>I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum:

70
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,370
<2-6,Sheldon>一开始甜蜜好滋味
<2-6,Sheldon>sweet and enjoyable at first,

71
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,780
<2-6,Sheldon>但最后也只是一团无味的悲哀
<2-6,Sheldon>but ultimately a flavorless lump of sadness.

72
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,180
<2-7,Raj>用水果口香糖来形容也没错
<2-7,Raj>You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe.

73
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,550
<2-7,Raj>但我向来都比较喜欢胶带泡泡糖
<2-7,Raj>I-I was always a Hubba Bubba man. Mm.

74
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,480
<2-8,Howard>喜欢胶带泡泡糖多过波波泡泡糖吗  你疯啦
<2-8,Howard>Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You're crazy.

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,960
<2-9,Raj>我下巴喜欢嚼哪种就哪种
<2-9,Raj>Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.

76
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,690
<2-10,Sheldon>两位
<2-10,Sheldon>Gentlemen!

77
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,690
<2-11,Raj>抱歉  是来说女朋友
<2-11,Raj>Oh, right, uh, girlfriend.

78
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,960
<2-12,Howard>你想找怎么样的呢
<2-12,Howard>But what are you looking for?

79
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,900
<2-13,Sheldon>我想找一个受过良好教育  非常聪明的女人
<2-13,Sheldon>All I'm looking for is an educated, intelligent woman

80
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,130
<2-13,Sheldon>跟我有相同的兴趣爱好
<2-13,Sheldon>who shares my interests

81
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,040
<2-13,Sheldon>但同时又有自己的想法与见解
<2-13,Sheldon>while retaining her own unique point of view.

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,930
<2-13,Sheldon>为人和蔼有耐心
<2-13,Sheldon>She should be kind, patient,

83
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,240
<2-13,Sheldon>而且最重要的是
<2-13,Sheldon>and most important,

84
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,800
<2-13,Sheldon>在今晚十点前就爱我爱到无法自拔
<2-13,Sheldon>unable to imagine life without me by 10:00 tonight.

85
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,670
<2-14,Howard>这要求是不是有点不合理
<2-14,Howard>Isn't that a little unreasonable?

86
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,180
<2-15,Sheldon>好吧  她不需要有自己的想法与见解
<2-15,Sheldon>All right, fine, she doesn't need her own point of view.

87
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,590
<2-15,Sheldon>赶紧开工吧
<2-15,Sheldon>Now, chop-chop.

88
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,710
<3-1,Penny>艾米  快点  让我们看看那裙子
<3-1,Penny>Come on, Amy, show us the dress.

89
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,700
<3-1,Penny>来啦
<3-1,Penny>Okay.

90
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,090
<3-2,Amy>但这真的是超出了我的舒适区
<3-2,Amy>But I'm really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.

91
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,680
<3-3,Penny>你的"舒适区"一点都没有露出来啊
<3-3,Penny>I don't think any of your comfort zones are showing.

92
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,630
<3-4,Bernadette>都第三次约会了
<3-4,Bernadette>Yeah, it's your third date--

93
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,150
<3-4,Bernadette>要不打扮性感点试试
<3-4,Bernadette>maybe you could go more sexy.

94
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,410
<3-5,Amy>有些人觉得最性感的器官是脑子呢
<3-5,Amy>Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.

95
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,500
<3-6,Penny>但我去酒吧的时候
<3-6,Penny>No one ever bought me drinks at a bar

96
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,130
<3-6,Penny>从来没有人因为我露"脑"而请我喝酒啊
<3-6,Penny>because my brain just popped out of my shirt.

97
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,050
<3-7,Amy>你们有没有高一点的高根鞋
<3-7,Amy>Do you have any heels higher than this?

98
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,570
<3-7,Amy>他个子还挺高
<3-7,Amy>He's pretty tall.

99
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,750
<3-9,Bernadette>高个子
<3-9,Bernadette>Ooh, tall!

100
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,030
<3-9,Bernadette>终于透露了点这位神秘男士的细枝末节了
<3-9,Bernadette>Finally some details about this mystery man.

101
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,630
<3-10,Penny>继续  再跟我们说说
<3-10,Penny>Yeah, come on, tell us more.

102
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,910
<3-11,Amy>我跟你们说过了他的名字  还有他很高
<3-11,Amy>Well, I told you his name and that he's tall.

103
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,330
<3-11,Amy>你们还需要知道什么啊
<3-11,Amy>What more do you need?

104
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,980
<3-12,Bernadette>你们接吻没
<3-12,Bernadette>Did you kiss him yet?

105
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,200
<3-13,Amy>就嘴唇上吻了一下
<3-13,Amy>Just a little peck on the lips.

106
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,630
<3-14,Penny>我们可是好闺蜜  再说一个细节吧
<3-14,Penny>Well, we're your best friends-- give us one more detail

107
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,640
<3-14,Penny>说完保证不再烦你
<3-14,Penny>and we promise we'll leave you alone.

108
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,520
<3-15,Amy>好吧
<3-15,Amy>Fine. Um...

109
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,470
<3-16,Penny>他是英国人
<3-16,Penny>he's British.

110
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,410
<3-15,Amy>好啦  这点的确是很让人兴奋
<3-15,Amy>All right, that is a juicy one.

111
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,290
<3-16,Penny>英国高个子戴夫今晚要带你上哪呢
<3-16,Penny>All right, where is Tall British Dave taking you?

112
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,420
<3-17,Bernadette>喝茶加打篮球吗
<3-17,Bernadette>Tea and basketball?

113
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,150
<3-18,Amy>去那家新开的意大利餐厅
<3-18,Amy>To that new Italian place on Walnut.

114
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,070
<3-19,Bernadette>挺好啊
<3-19,Bernadette>Oh, nice.

115
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,400
<3-20,Amy>我再去找找别双鞋
<3-20,Amy>I'm gonna go look for other shoes.

116
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,120
<3-21,Penny>加油找吧
<3-21,Penny>Good luck.

117
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,810
<3-21,Penny>嫁给莱纳德时  我把高的高跟鞋全扔了
<3-21,Penny>I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.

118
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,240
<3-22,Bernadette>你今晚想路过他们的约会地
<3-22,Bernadette>Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight

119
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,780
<3-22,Bernadette>看看那男人的庐山真面目吗
<3-22,Bernadette>and get a look at this guy?

120
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,510
<3-23,Penny>我们都不知道他们约了几点
<3-23,Penny>We don't even know what time they're gonna be there.

121
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,720
<3-24,Bernadette>我可以打给那个餐厅
<3-24,Bernadette>I'll just call the restaurant,

122
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,700
<3-24,Bernadette>假装我是艾米  再确认一下预定时间
<3-24,Bernadette>pretend I'm Amy and check the reservation.

123
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,100
<3-25,Penny>靠  你真贼
<3-25,Penny>Damn, you're sneaky.

124
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,040
<3-26,Bernadette>但我人小  做啥都萌萌哒
<3-26,Bernadette>Yeah, but I'm little, so it's adorable.

125
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,150
<4-1,Howard>我觉得帮你找女朋友最快的方法
<4-1,Howard>I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend

126
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,900
<4-1,Howard>就是帮你注册市面上所有的相亲网站
<4-1,Howard>is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.

127

<4-2,Sheldon>pretending to be a real person.

132
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,280
<4-3,Raj>你担心电脑AI比你这人形AI会聊天吗
<4-3,Raj>And you're afraid it'll do a better job than you?

<4-6,Sheldon>众多有前瞻性的女性们
<4-6,Sheldon>Uh, prospective women weed themselves out

143
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,660
<4-6,Sheldon>默默坐到本皇身边
<4-6,Sheldon>while I watch Daredevil.

144
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,820
<4-7,Howard>你真的认为女人会为你而战吗
<4-7,Howard>You seriously think women would fight for you?

145
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,990
<4-8,Sheldon>人们会为了工作和奖杯而战  为啥不会为我
<4-8,Sheldon>People compete for jobs and trophies-- why not me?

146
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,600
<4-9,Howard>他说得对  他的确知道很多笑话
<4-9,Howard>He's right-- he knows a lot of jokes.

<4-10,Raj>对  不  但这的确是人的本性
<4-10,Raj>Yeah-- no, but it is basic human nature.

148
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,110
<4-10,Raj>如果把他像奖品般呈现  或许真有女人会抢
<4-10,Raj>If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.

149
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,640
<4-11,Howard>他很聪明
<4-11,Howard>Well, he's smart,

151
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,360
<4-12,Sheldon>而且我有一双深情似水的明眸

152
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,260
<4-13,Raj>我可不会说你的眼...
<4-13,Raj>I don't know if I'd say you...

153
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,590
<4-14,Howard>我有个主意
<4-14,Howard>I have an idea.

154
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,980
<4-14,Howard>不如我们在分类广告网上发个帖子  就写
<4-14,Howard>What if we put a post on Craigslist that says:

155
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,350
<4-14,Howard>"加州理工学院世界级物理学家征女友一名

<4-15,Sheldon>才能筛掉不合格的候选人
<4-15,Sheldon>to eliminate unworthy candidates.

160
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,450
<4-16,Raj>我们可以设置得像一个寻宝游戏
<4-16,Raj>Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt

161
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,140
<4-16,Raj>解开最后一道题才能得到谢尔顿的联系方式

<7-29,Dave>Was he a neurobiologist like you?

246
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,530
<7-30,Amy>不  他是加州理工的理论物理学家
<7-30,Amy>No. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech.

247
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,350
<7-31,Dave>我虽喜欢教数学  可那才是我梦寐以求的工作
<7-31,Dave>I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job.

248
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,630
<7-31,Dave>他的研究方向是什么
<7-31,Dave>What's his focus?

249
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,850
<7-32,Amy>之前是弦理论  现在换成了暗物质
<7-32,Amy>Um... used to be string theory, now it's dark matter.

250
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,950
<7-32,Amy>不过...我们还是不要谈谢尔顿了
<7-32,Amy>But... let's not discuss Sheldon.

251
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,090
<7-32,Amy>还是来谈谈你吧
<7-32,Amy>Let's get back to you.

252
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,140
<7-33,Dave>等等  你说的该不会是谢尔顿·库珀博士吧
<7-33,Dave>Wait, you're not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

253
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,280
<7-34,Amy>我正努力不提呢
<7-34,Amy>I'm trying not to.

254
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,850
<7-34,Amy>你认识他吗
<7-34,Amy>Do you know him?

255
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,060
<7-35,Dave>不认识  但我关注他的研究很多年了
<7-35,Dave>No, but I've followed his work for years.

256
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,320
<7-35,Dave>他可是学界巨星啊
<7-35,Dave>He's a rock star.

257
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,690
<7-35,Dave>你一定得给我好好说说他
<7-35,Dave>You've got to tell me about him.

258
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,530
<7-35,Dave>他是个什么样的人啊
<7-35,Dave>What's he like?

259
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,830
<7-36,Penny>他看起来相当喜欢她呢
<7-36,Penny>He really seems into her.

260
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,300
<7-37,Bernadette>我拍了一段影片
<7-37,Bernadette>I took a video.

261
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,690
<7-37,Bernadette>我都忘了这事有多好玩
<7-37,Bernadette>I forgot how much fun this is.

262
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,870
<7-38,Leonard>好了  我们看见他们了
<7-38,Leonard>Okay, we saw them.

263
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,680
<7-38,Leonard>我们可以去看电影了吗
<7-38,Leonard>Can we go catch the movie?

264
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,980
<7-39,Bernadette>你为什么要带他来
<7-39,Bernadette>Why'd you bring him?

265
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,400
<7-40,Penny>没办法啊  我俩被一纸婚书捆绑了
<7-40,Penny>I had to; we're married now.

266
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,370
<7-41,Bernadette>老娘感同身受啊
<7-41,Bernadette>Ugh, I hear that.

267
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,400
<7-42,Dave>抱歉  让我再问最后一个关于谢尔顿的问题
<7-42,Dave>I'm sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.

268
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,870
<7-43,Amy>好吧  问吧
<7-43,Amy>Sure, why not?

269
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,570
<7-44,Dave>其实这个问题分为四个小题
<7-44,Dave>It's more of a four-part question, really.

270
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,260
<7-44,Dave>他撰写超奇异质数的论文时
<7-44,Dave>When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers,

271
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,790
<7-44,Dave>花了多长时间
<7-44,Dave>how long did it take?

272
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,720
<7-45,Amy>大概一个半小时吧
<7-45,Amy>Um... about an hour and half.

273
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,430
<7-46,Dave>哇  我的亲娘呀
<7-46,Dave>I mean, wow!

274
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,150
<7-46,Dave>你亲眼目睹了吗
<7-46,Dave>And you were there to see it?

275
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,890
<7-47,Amy>是的  我们当时正在外面约会
<7-47,Amy>Yes. Yep. We were on a date.

276
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,370
<7-47,Amy>跟现在情况差不多
<7-47,Amy>Very much like this one.

277
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,970
<7-48,Dave>我对此深表怀疑
<7-48,Dave>I doubt it was like this one.

278
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,570
<7-48,Dave>他可是个大天才
<7-48,Dave>I mean, he's a genius,

279
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,920
<7-48,Dave>而我的智商低到无法想通
<7-48,Dave>and I wasn't even smart enough to figure out

280
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,990
<7-48,Dave>为什么我老婆闻起来总是一股牛角面包味
<7-48,Dave>why my wife always smelled of croissants.

281
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,030
<7-49,Amy>你剩下的问题是什么
<7-49,Amy>What was the rest of your question?

282
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,490
<7-50,Dave>你可以把我介绍给他吗
<7-50,Dave>Do you think you could introduce me to him?

283
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,760
<7-50,Dave>你说真的吗
<7-50,Dave>Really?

284
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,630
<7-51,Amy>你想让我介绍我的前男友给你认识吗
<7-51,Amy>You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?

285
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,440
<7-52,Dave>你说得对  这太诡异了
<7-52,Dave>You're right, it's-it's weird.

286
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,540
<7-52,Dave>不  等等  就这么做吧
<7-52,Dave>No, wait. Do it.

287
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,170
<7-52,Dave>不  我改变主意了
<7-52,Dave>No. I changed my mind.

288
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,900
<7-52,Dave>我一定会紧张死的
<7-52,Dave>I'd be too nervous.

289
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,200
<7-52,Dave>我不知该如何是好了
<7-52,Dave>Oh! I don't know what to do.

290
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,260
<7-53,Leonard>我们还要待多久
<7-53,Leonard>Are we gonna be much longer?

291
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,910
<7-53,Leonard>我要上厕所了
<7-53,Leonard>I really have to go to the bathroom.

292
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,920
<7-53,Leonard>早有准备
<7-53,Leonard>Right here.

293
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,210
<8-1,Raj>离最后期限还差37分钟
<8-1,Raj>37 minutes left until the deadline.

294
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,130
<8-2,Sheldon>会有人出现的
<8-2,Sheldon>Someone will show.

295
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,280
<8-3,Howard>不管最后结果如何
<8-3,Howard>And no matter what happens,

296
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,480
<8-3,Howard>这都将是一个好玩的实验
<8-3,Howard>this is still a fun experiment.

297
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,950
<8-4,Raj>肯定比不上那晚用微波炉爆葡萄好玩
<8-4,Raj>Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave.

298
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,520
<8-4,Raj>我们的确活得很精彩啊
<8-4,Raj>We really have led full lives.

299
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,300
<8-5,Sheldon>会有人会出现的
<8-5,Sheldon>Someone will show.

300
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,110
<8-6,Raj>也许你不想要和你完全一样的人
<8-6,Raj>Maybe you don't want someone exactly like you.

301
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,520
<8-6,Raj>你知道大家都说  异性相吸
<8-6,Raj>You know what they say: opposites attract.

302
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,850
<8-7,Sheldon>照这个逻辑来说
<8-7,Sheldon>Well, by that logic,

303
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,800
<8-7,Sheldon>那我是该找个又矮又无聊又黏人的那种吗
<8-7,Sheldon>I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh?

304
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,270
<8-7,Sheldon>我不是故意要吐槽
<8-7,Sheldon>Not to cast aspersions,

305
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,780
<8-7,Sheldon>不过我在这儿一挥手  就能打中几个这样的人呢
<8-7,Sheldon>but I can't shake a stick around here without hitting that.

306
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,640
<9-1,Dave>我曾经驾车500英里
<9-1,Dave>You know, I once drove 500 miles

307
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,880
<9-1,Dave>只为了聆听他在斯坦福演讲
<9-1,Dave>to hear him speak at Stanford.

308
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,490
<9-2,Amy>我有那堂课的DVD
<9-2,Amy>I have a DVD of that lecture.

309
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,410
<9-3,Dave>真的吗  是不是特别棒
<9-3,Dave>Really? Wasn't it great?

310
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,980
<9-4,Amy>作为情人节的礼物  一点都不棒
<9-4,Amy>Not as a Valentine's present, no.

311
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,230
<9-5,Dave>下次你再看那张碟时
<9-5,Dave>Well, the next time you watch it,

312
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,540
<9-5,Dave>我就是那个提问题被他评为
<9-5,Dave>I'm the bloke who asked the question

313
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,580
<9-5,Dave>又蠢又傻的那个小子
<9-5,Dave>that he said was stupid and obvious.

314
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,750
<9-5,Dave>那是他对在场人士说的最友善的话了
<9-5,Dave>It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.

315
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,150
<9-6,Amy>那还真是厉害
<9-6,Amy>That's, um, terrific.

316
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,070
<9-6,Amy>我有点累了  今晚先这样好吗
<9-6,Amy>Listen, I'm-I'm kind of tired. Can we call it a night?

317
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,440
<9-7,Dave>哎呀  对不起  我一整晚都在
<9-7,Dave>Oh, gosh. Sorry, I've just spent the whole night

318
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,140
<9-7,Dave>谈论你的前男友
<9-7,Dave>talking about your ex-boyfriend.

319
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,380
<9-7,Dave>我真是个大傻瓜
<9-7,Dave>I'm such an idiot.

320
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,100
<9-8,Amy>不  你不是
<9-8,Amy>No, you're not.

321
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,920
<9-9,Dave>也许还不算是傻瓜  但肯定不如
<9-9,Dave>Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as...

322
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,500
<9-9,Dave>那个不能提的人聪明
<9-9,Dave>someone we won't mention.

323
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,950
<9-10,Amy>谢谢
<9-10,Amy>Thank you.

324
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,200
<9-11,Dave>但你说了你也许会把我介绍给他
<9-11,Dave>But you said you might introduce me to him--

325
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,940
<9-11,Dave>我周四有空哦
<9-11,Dave>I'm free on Thursday.

326
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,390
<9-12,Bernadette>他们要起身离开了
<9-12,Bernadette>Hey, hey, they're leaving.

327
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,100
<9-13,Penny>什么  给我  给我
<9-13,Penny>What? Here, give me, give me.

328
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,460
<9-13,Penny>天啊  天啊  他们正向我们走来
<9-13,Penny>Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they're coming right towards us.

329
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,650
<9-14,Bernadette>我们得赶紧离开
<9-14,Bernadette>We got to get out of here.

330
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,000
<9-15,Penny>好的  等等  莱纳德怎么办
<9-15,Penny>Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?

331
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,690
<9-16,Bernadette>他和他的小膀胱可以去搭巴士
<9-16,Bernadette>He and his tiny bladder can take the bus!

332
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,010
<9-17,Penny>不是吧
<9-17,Penny>Oh, no!

333
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,020
<9-18,Dave>她把我的车给撞了
<9-18,Dave>She just hit my car!

334
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,650
<9-19,Amy>你们怎么在这里
<9-19,Amy>What are you guys doing here?

335
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,350
<9-20,Bernadette>好啊  艾米  你怎么在这呢
<9-20,Bernadette>Oh! Hey, Ames! What are you doing here?

336
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,050
<9-21,Leonard>怎么回事
<9-21,Leonard>What happened?

337
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,160
<9-21,Leonard>老天爷
<9-21,Leonard>Omg!

338
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,790
<9-22,Dave>您不是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德吧
<9-22,Dave>Aren't you Leonard Hofstadter?

339
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,990
<9-23,Leonard>是
<9-23,Leonard>Yeah.

340
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,580
<9-24,Dave>我看过你在斯坦福跟谢尔顿一起演讲
<9-24,Dave>I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper!

341
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,840
<9-24,Dave>艾米  你相信吗
<9-24,Dave>Amy, can you believe it?

342
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,420
<9-24,Dave>这居然是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
<9-24,Dave>It's Dr. Leonard Hofstadter!

343
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,520
<9-25,Amy>不相信  快把我从梦中捏醒
<9-25,Amy>No. Pinch me.

344
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,240
<9-26,Dave>见到你真是太高兴了  能握个手吗
<9-26,Dave>It's an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?

345
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,890
<9-27,Leonard>不知道你愿不愿意  我才刚刚
<9-27,Leonard>I don't know if you want to do that-- I was just...

346
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,680
<9-27,Leonard>好吧  当我没说
<9-27,Leonard>Okay, never mind.

347
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,010
<9-28,Dave>艾米  我这辈子再也不洗这只手了
<9-28,Dave>Amy, I'm never washing this hand again.

348
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,630
<9-29,Leonard>你应该好好洗
<9-29,Leonard>You really should.

349
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,050
<9-29,Leonard>60秒
<9-29,Leonard>60 seconds.

350
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,650
<10-1,Raj>这可不妙
<10-1,Raj>This is not looking good.

351
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,640
<10-2,Sheldon>一分钟足够长了
<10-2,Sheldon>One minute is a long time.

352
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,290
<10-3,Howard>这句话我跟女人说了二十年
<10-3,Howard>I've been telling women that for 20 years.

353
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,580
<10-5,Sheldon>45秒
<10-5,Sheldon>45.

354
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,730
<10-5,Sheldon>45秒足够一个女人
<10-5,Sheldon>45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman

355
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,590
<10-5,Sheldon>走进那扇门  然后爱上我了
<10-5,Sheldon>to walk through that door and fall in love with me.

356
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,920
<10-5,Sheldon>要是用上我这双星星眼  时间还要减半呢
<10-5,Sheldon>You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.

357
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,320
<10-6,Raj>30秒
<10-6,Raj>30 seconds.

358
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,090
<10-7,Sheldon>万一是詹妮弗·劳伦斯呢
<10-7,Sheldon>What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?

359
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,460
<10-8,Howard>什么
<10-8,Howard>What?

360
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,320
<10-9,Sheldon>上一部《饥饿游戏》可不是我的菜
<10-9,Sheldon>Oh, that last  Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.

361
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,590
<10-10,Howard>你不是说她在《X战警》里演得特别好吗
<10-10,Howard>You thought she was great in X-Men.

362
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,780
<10-11,Sheldon>好吧  我不会拒绝詹妮弗·劳伦斯的
<10-11,Sheldon>Oh, fine-- I won't shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.

363
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,270
<10-12,Raj>各位  15秒了
<10-12,Raj>Guys, 15 seconds.

364
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,580
<10-13,Howard>也许她是等着最后一刻出场呢
<10-13,Howard>Maybe she's waiting to show up at the last possible moment.

365
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,300
<10-14,Sheldon>听起来好爱演的事儿精女生
<10-14,Sheldon>Sounds like a drama queen.

366
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,900
<10-14,Sheldon>不  还真是詹妮弗·劳伦斯啊
<10-14,Sheldon>Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.

00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,210
<10-15,Raj>太糟了
<10-15,Raj>That's too bad.

373
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,250
<10-16,Howard>可能我们把题出得太难了
<10-16,Howard>Maybe we did make the test too difficult.

374
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,850
<10-17,Raj>我觉得这不重要  听着  谢尔顿
<10-17,Raj>I don't think it matters. Look, Sheldon,

375
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,350

<10-17,Raj>命里无时莫强求  好吗
<10-17,Raj>it'll just happen. Okay?

377
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,120
<10-17,Raj>不能因为一场测试或某个网站
<10-17,Raj>Not because of a test or a Web site,

378
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
<10-17,Raj>而是因为...
<10-17,Raj>but because...

379
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,480
<10-17,Raj>我们是梦想中的梦想者
<10-17,Raj>We are the dreamers of dreams!

<10-18,Howard>真是个姑娘  还很漂亮
<10-18,Howard>It's an actual girl, and she's really pretty.

00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,090
<10-20,Sheldon>有什么需要帮忙的吗
<10-20,Sheldon>Can I help you?

384
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,280
<10-21,Girl>你是分类广告网站上登广告的物理学家吗
<10-21,Girl>Um, a-are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?

385
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,380
<10-22,Sheldon>是的
<10-22,Sheldon>Yes.

386
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,540
<10-23,Girl>你好  我叫温妮沙·班尼特
<10-23,Girl>Hi. I'm Vanessa Bennett.

<10-23,Girl>抱歉这么久才来
<10-23,Girl>Sorry it took a while for me to get here.

388
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,610
<10-23,Girl>我在听无聊的原子光谱学讲座
<10-23,Girl>I was stuck in this boring symposium

389
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,330
<10-23,Girl>想走又走不了  直到看到了你的广告
<10-23,Girl>on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad,

390
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,910
<10-23,Girl>真是拯救了我这无聊的一夜
<10-23,Girl>and it saved my night.

391
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,640
<10-23,Girl>那些题非常有趣
<10-23,Girl>The puzzles were... were really fun.

392
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
<10-23,Girl>我还从来没有把克林贡语
<10-23,Girl>I've never had to translate Klingon

393
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,480
<10-23,Girl>翻译成古梵文呢
<10-23,Girl>into ancient Sanskrit before.

394
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,620
<10-24,Sheldon>小心  很容易上瘾的
<10-24,Sheldon>Well... careful, hmm, it's addictive.

395
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,330
<10-25,Vanessa>[克林贡语]
<10-25,Vanessa>Chija''e'vlKub je.

396
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,740
<10-25,Vanessa>或者用梵文说是
<10-25,Vanessa>Or, as they say in Sanskrit...

397
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,620
<10-25,Vanessa>[梵文]
<10-25,Vanessa>Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.

398
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,870
<10-26,Sheldon>你看吧  你中了克林贡语译梵文的毒
<10-26,Sheldon>And just like that, you're a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.

399
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,090
<10-27,Vanessa>总之我觉得必须见见这位
<10-27,Vanessa>Anyway, I-I just... I knew I had to meet the person

400
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,370
<10-27,Vanessa>想出如此绝妙点子的人
<10-27,Vanessa>responsible for such a brilliant idea.

401
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,470
<10-27,Vanessa>毕竟不用我说你也知道  这世上很少有
<10-27,Vanessa>And I don't need to tell you, there aren't a lot of men

402
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,730
<10-27,Vanessa>同样热爱物理学  古代语言和旗帜的人
<10-27,Vanessa>who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.

403
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,340
<10-28,Sheldon>我也算凤毛麟角的人物了
<10-28,Sheldon>I am a bit of a unicorn.

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,020
<10-28,Sheldon>你确实是一位特别的姑娘
<10-28,Sheldon>Well, you certainly seem like a special lady,

00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,330
<10-29,Raj>你怎么能就这么赶她走了
<10-29,Raj>How could you send her away?!

408
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,220
<10-30,Sheldon>她来晚了
<10-30,Sheldon>She was late.

409
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,680
<10-30,Sheldon>而且她居然说原子光谱学无聊
<10-30,Sheldon>And...she found atomic spectroscopy boring.

410
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,460
<10-30,Sheldon>用你们的生殖器我也不想和她交配
<10-30,Sheldon>Well, I wouldn't coitus her with your genitals.
