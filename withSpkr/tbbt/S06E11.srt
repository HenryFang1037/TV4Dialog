19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,360
<2-2,Sheldon>我应该先说在前头
<2-2,Sheldon>I should've mentioned this earlier.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,880
<2-2,Sheldon>你未被邀请
<2-2,Sheldon>You're not invited.

22
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,550
<2-4,Sheldon>艾米  每隔一段时间
<2-4,Sheldon>Amy, from time to time,

23
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,930
<2-4,Sheldon>我们男人都需要挣脱文明礼仪的束缚
<2-4,Sheldon>we men need to break free from the shackles of civility

24
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,860
<2-4,Sheldon>并回归原始野性的自我
<2-4,Sheldon>and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,240
<2-5,Amy>就掷掷骰子
<2-5,Amy>By rolling dice

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,660
<2-5,Amy>然后用小人偶玩幻想游戏也算啊
<2-5,Amy>and playing make-believe with little figurines?

27
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,910
<2-6,Sheldon>是啊  又野蛮又粗暴啊

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,920
<3-1,Bernadette>还想着那晚能是二人时光呢
<3-1,Bernadette>That was gonna be our night.

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,220
<3-2,Howard>我不去不行啊

32
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,540
<3-2,Howard>我们大家要一起玩啊
<3-2,Howard>We play as a group.

33
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,560
<3-2,Howard>要是我去不成  其他人会说你坏话的
<3-2,Howard>If-if I'm not there, then everyone will blame you.

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,980
<3-2,Howard>他们就会说  "伯纳黛特超扫兴
<3-2,Howard>They'll be all, "Bernadette ruined everything.

35
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,130
<3-2,Howard>她个臭八婆"
<3-2,Howard>She's the worst."

36
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,450
<3-2,Howard>你理解吗
<3-2,Howard>So, you see?

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,850
<3-2,Howard>我不能不去玩《龙与地下城》啊
<3-2,Howard>I have to play Dungeons and Dragons...

38
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,990
<3-2,Howard>是为我们婚姻着想
<3-2,Howard>for the marriage.

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,520
<3-3,Bernadette>你个死白痴
<3-3,Bernadette>You're an idiot.

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,070
<3-4,Howard>是你的小白痴
<3-4,Howard>I'm your idiot.

41
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,010
<3-4,Howard>死都甩不掉哦
<3-4,Howard>Forever.

42
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,890
<3-4,Howard>听我说  我们之前的确是说了
<3-4,Howard>So, listen, I know we talked about

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,010
<4-1,Raj>要去银湖吃吃东西
<4-1,Raj>getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake,

44
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,360
<4-1,Raj>然后去格里菲斯公园看看圣诞灯饰
<4-1,Raj>and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park,

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,370
<4-1,Raj>可莱纳德找我们去他家玩《龙与地下城》呢
<4-1,Raj>but Leonard's talking about a big D and D game at his place.

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,410
<4-2,Stuart>周六夜要从嗨翻升级成史诗级啦
<4-2,Stuart>Saturday night just went from crazy to epic!

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,790
<4-2,Stuart>生活大爆炸

48
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,180
<4-2,Stuart>谢尔顿  要想开始征途
<4-2,Stuart>All right, Sheldon, to start our quest,

49
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,770
<5-1,Leonard>你必须先打开我送你的这圣诞礼物
<5-1,Leonard>you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.

50
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,590
<5-2,Sheldon>圣诞礼物啊
<5-2,Sheldon>A Christmas gift?

51
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,920
<5-2,Sheldon>你明知道我不爱圣诞节
<5-2,Sheldon>You know I don't enjoy Christmas.

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,270
<5-3,Stuart>圣诞节有什么不好啊
<5-3,Stuart>What's wrong with Christmas?

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,510
<5-4,Sheldon>太多缺点  不知从何开始
<5-4,Sheldon>Oh, where to begin?

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,970
<5-4,Sheldon>室内摆树
<5-4,Sheldon>Trees indoors.

55
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,180
<5-4,Sheldon>猛拽古文  例如"此乃"圣诞佳节
<5-4,Sheldon>Overuse of the words "'tis" and "'twas."

56
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,920
<5-4,Sheldon>还有这荒谬的单脚袜习俗
<5-4,Sheldon>And the absurd custom of one stocking.

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,550
<5-4,Sheldon>是人都知道  袜子就该成双成对
<5-4,Sheldon>Everyone knows socks belong in pairs.

58
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,480
<5-4,Sheldon>谁会要单脚袜啊
<5-4,Sheldon>Who uses one sock?

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,680
<5-4,Sheldon>一只脚是木制假腿的海盗吧
<5-4,Sheldon>Pirate with a peg leg?

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,750
<5-5,Sheldon>有用处我就舒服多了  谢啦
<5-5,Sheldon>Actually that helps, thank you.

<5-6,Leonard>就赶紧看里面有啥嘛
<5-6,Leonard>Would you just look inside?

62
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,330
<5-7,Sheldon>是个卷轴
<5-7,Sheldon>Oh, a scroll.

63
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,720
<5-7,Sheldon>我最爱卷轴了
<5-7,Sheldon>I like scrolls.

64
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,420
<5-7,Sheldon>卷轴是我第三喜爱的
<5-7,Sheldon>They're my third favorite system of

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,550
<5-7,Sheldon>文字传输方式
<5-7,Sheldon>transmitting the written word.

66
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,220
<5-7,Sheldon>仅在石碑与飞机空中文字之后
<5-7,Sheldon>After stone tablets and skywriting.

67

<5-7,Sheldon>"在座各位皆是被召唤来参与

69
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,120
<5-7,Sheldon>你们踏上征途的起因
<5-7,Sheldon>Your quest begins in

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,580
<5-7,Sheldon>是由于一个神秘的北方小精灵村庄
<5-7,Sheldon>a secret northern village of elves

71
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,370
<5-7,Sheldon>被人血洗屠村"
<5-7,Sheldon>who have all been massacred."

72
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,390
<5-7,Sheldon>这故事走向我喜欢
<5-7,Sheldon>I like where this is heading.

73
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,080
<5-7,Sheldon>"你们的任务是要营救
<5-7,Sheldon>"Your task is to rescue their leader

74
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,770
<5-7,Sheldon>被困于食人魔地下城的村长"
<5-7,Sheldon>from a dungeon of ogres."

75
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,980
<5-7,Sheldon>好妙的故事转折啊
<5-7,Sheldon>Oh, that's a saucy twist.

76
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,430
<5-7,Sheldon>"而村长的名字是...
<5-7,Sheldon>"That leader's name:

77
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,440
<5-7,Sheldon>圣诞老人"
<5-7,Sheldon>Santa Claus""

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,330
<5-8,Leonard>不  不  不啊
<5-8,Leonard>No, no, no!

79
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,380
<5-8,Leonard>圣诞老人是"呵  呵  呵"的笑
<5-8,Leonard>It's actually, "Ho, ho, ho,"

80
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,300
<5-8,Leonard>你再多练练就会了
<5-8,Leonard>but you'll get the hang of it.

81
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,210
<5-8,Leonard>我觉得把节日混合入任务里
<5-8,Leonard>Thought it'd be fun to make

82
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,650
<5-8,Leonard>会很有意思嘛
<5-8,Leonard>a quest with a holiday theme.

83
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,620
<5-8,Leonard>有意思吗
<5-8,Leonard>Fun?

84
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,780
<5-9,Sheldon>把《龙与地下城》跟圣诞节混合起来
<5-9,Sheldon>Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is

85
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,090
<5-9,Sheldon>就像是做三明治  把最好吃的果冻
<5-9,Sheldon>like making a sandwich of grape jelly,

86
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,400
<5-9,Sheldon>葡萄果冻
<5-9,Sheldon>the best-tasting jelly,

87

<5-9,Sheldon>跟最难吃的果冻  石化制果冻混一起
<5-9,Sheldon>and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.

<5-10,Leonard>身处于圣诞村烟雾弥漫的废墟之中
<5-10,Leonard>in the smoking remains of Santa's village.

92
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,570
<5-10,Leonard>显然  此地刚发生过一场大战"
<5-10,Leonard>Clearly, a great battle has taken place."

93

<5-11,Raj>好兴奋啊  第一个怪物露头
<5-11,Raj>Oh, man, the first monster I see,

94
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,450
<5-11,Raj>我要潜到他背后  掏出我的小魔棒
<5-11,Raj>I'm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand,

95
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,240
<5-11,Raj>用我的魔法射满他菊花
<5-11,Raj>and shoot my magic all over his ass.

96
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,580
<5-12,Stuart>你说出这些话时  自己有听到吗
<5-12,Stuart>Do you hear yourself when you say these things?

97
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,930
<5-13,Leonard>在雪地上发现了食人魔足印
<5-13,Leonard>Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of

98
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,480
<5-13,Leonard>还有用拐杖糖碎块留下的路线线索
<5-13,Leonard>broken candy canes in the snow.

99
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,540
<5-13,Leonard>谢尔顿  你采取什么行动
<5-13,Leonard>Sheldon, what do you do?

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,430
<5-14,Sheldon>我选择这你残酷  没人性
<5-14,Sheldon>I signal my contempt for your cruel plan

101
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,430
<5-14,Sheldon>硬逼我庆祝圣诞节计划
<5-14,Sheldon>to shove Christmas joy down my throat

102
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,970
<5-14,Sheldon>以"你们瞧这二货"的言语来加以鄙视
<5-14,Sheldon>by making a gesture that says, "get a load of this guy."

103
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,850
<5-15,Leonard>行  霍华德  你采取什么行动
<5-15,Leonard>Fine. Howard, what do you do?

104
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,380

<5-16,Howard>I follow the ogre tracks,

105
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,480
<5-16,Howard>并在跟踪时  检查路上有无暗门密道
<5-16,Howard>checking for secret doors along the way.

106
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,810
<5-17,Leonard>你发现了一个门后是阴暗走廊的暗门
<5-17,Leonard>And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,200
<6-18,Raj>别告诉她们我出身富庶
<6-18,Raj>Don't tell them I come from money.

185
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,660
<6-18,Raj>我要她们爱我  而不是爱我的钱
<6-18,Raj>I want them to love me for me.

186
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,990
<6-18,Raj>她们一定要超级性感
<6-18,Raj>They must be insanely hot.

187
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,000
<6-19,Penny>身材样貌起码得有9分或10分
<6-19,Penny>Like, nines or tens.

189
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,470
<6-20,Raj>好吧  8分也可以接受
<6-20,Raj>Okay, an eight is acceptable

190
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,160
<6-20,Raj>前提是她会带另外一个8分女来跟我三人泡澡
<6-20,Raj>if she's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.

191
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,440
<6-21,Bernadette>反正  我们找着啥样的你都会要  对吧
<6-21,Bernadette>Bottom line: you'll take any woman who'll have you, right?

192
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,210
<6-22,Raj>果断会要

<7-3,Stuart>与其扶持一个朋友
<7-3,Stuart>Why support a friend

198
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,970
<7-3,Stuart>为何不去扶持一家把你朋友的生活
<7-3,Stuart>when you can support a multinational conglomerate

199
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,140
<7-3,Stuart>挤压得穷苦潦倒的跨国大企业呢
<7-3,Stuart>that is crushing the life out of that friend?

200
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,910
<7-4,Leonard>我知道  但当我上网购物时
<7-4,Leonard>I know, but when I shop online,

201
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,720
<7-4,Leonard>我可以边上厕所边买

00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,690
<7-8,Howard>我才不会说这么幼稚的话呢
<7-8,Howard>I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.

213
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,520
<7-9,Leonard>很好  那你会怎么做
<7-9,Leonard>Great. What do you do?

218
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,070
<7-12,Leonard>现在房间两侧的墙壁开始往中间逼近
<7-12,Leonard>and now the walls of the room start closing in.

219
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,790
<7-13,Stuart>这下惨了

<7-23,Howard>肯定就那首圣诞颂歌不是犹太人写的
<7-23,Howard>Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,300
<7-26,Sheldon>* 是日圣徒节 *
<7-26,Sheldon>* Good King Wenceslas looked out *

239
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,110
<7-26,Sheldon>* 贤君帘外望 *
<7-26,Sheldon>* On the feast of Stephen *

240
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,800
<7-26,Sheldon>* 积雪覆大地 *
<7-26,Sheldon>* When the snow lay 'round about *

241
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,990
<7-26,Sheldon>* 松脆且平旷 *
<7-26,Sheldon>* Deep and crisp and even *

242
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,330
<7-27,Leonard>墙越来越近啦
<7-27,Leonard>The walls are getting slower.

243
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,250
<7-28,Sheldon>* 是夜月皎皎 *
<7-28,Sheldon>* Brightly shone the moon that night *

244
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,930
<7-28,Sheldon>* 寒霜亦凄凄 *
<7-28,Sheldon>* Though the frost was cru-el *

245
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,710
<7-28,Sheldon>* 但见褴褛者 *
<7-28,Sheldon>* When a poor man came in sight *

246
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,290
<7-28,Sheldon>* 拾薪不停息 *
<7-28,Sheldon>* Gath'ring winter fu-el *

247
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,440
<7-27,Leonard>墙壁停下了  你们安全了
<7-27,Leonard>The walls stop! You're safe!

248
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,190
<7-29,Howard>你可真牛  谢尔顿
<7-29,Howard>That was amazing, Sheldon.

249
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,990
<7-30,Stuart>-你怎么会唱这个  -很简单
<7-30,Stuart>- How did you know that? - It was simple.

250
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,180
<7-31,Sheldon>我将一个关于波西米亚的知名历史事件
<7-31,Sheldon>I combined a well-known, historical fact

251
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,840
<7-31,Sheldon>与我对外祖父母的记忆结合在一起
<7-31,Sheldon>about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents,

252
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,040
<7-31,Sheldon>那时候外公和外婆  唱着圣诞颂歌
<7-31,Sheldon>Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols

253
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,250
<7-31,Sheldon>而我在壁炉前尝试用乐高来制造
<7-31,Sheldon>while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build

254
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,220
<7-31,Sheldon>一个高能粒子加速器
<7-31,Sheldon>a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.

255
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,690
<7-32,Leonard>继续我们的任务吧
<7-32,Leonard>Okay, continuing our quest.

256
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,460
<7-33,Sheldon>等一下
<7-33,Sheldon>W-W-Wait.

257
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,760
<7-33,Sheldon>还有四段没唱呢
<7-33,Sheldon>There's still four more verses.

258
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,570
<7-33,Sheldon>总不能唱个开头没结尾吧
<7-33,Sheldon>You don't sing a song and not finish it.

259
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,740
<7-33,Sheldon>* 嗟尔侍者来 *
<7-33,Sheldon>* Hither, page, and stand by me *

260
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,310
<7-33,Sheldon>* 务必据实语 *
<7-33,Sheldon>* If thou know'st it telling ,*

261
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,080
<7-33,Sheldon>* 彼处何许人 *
<7-33,Sheldon>* Yonder peasant, who is he? *

262
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,900
<7-33,Sheldon>* 此人何所居 *
<7-33,Sheldon>* Where and what his dwelling? *

263
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,960
<7-33,Sheldon>* 是夜月皎皎  寒霜亦凄... *
<7-33,Sheldon>* Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost...*

264
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,530
<8-1,Bernadette>看来他进展不错啊
<8-1,Bernadette>It Looks like he's doing pretty good.

265
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,660
<8-2,Penny>那是当然了
<8-2,Penny>Of course he is.

266
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,560
<8-2,Penny>那姑娘刚被男朋友甩了
<8-2,Penny>Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend.

267
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,040
<8-2,Penny>满心愤怒  又醉得烂醉
<8-2,Penny>She's angry, she's drunk,

268
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,400
<8-2,Penny>最爱的电影还是印度电影《贫民窟的百万富翁》
<8-2,Penny>and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean...

269
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,740
<8-3,Amy>必须手到擒来啊
<8-3,Amy>That is some low-hanging fruit.

270
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,610
<8-4,Bernadette>他回来了
<8-4,Bernadette>Oh, here he comes.

271
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,410
<8-5,Penny>-怎么样啊  -一切顺利
<8-5,Penny>- So, how'd it go? - Great.

272
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,910
<8-6,Raj>我请她喝了几杯酒
<8-6,Raj>I bought her a couple of drinks,

273
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,780
<8-6,Raj>她就把邮箱地址给我了
<8-6,Raj>and she gave me her E-mail address.

274
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,180
<8-8,Bernadette>杰妮芙@就算男人死光了只剩你都不要.废柴
<8-8,Bernadette>"Jennifer@not-even-if-you-were- the-last-guy-on-earth.loser""

275
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,730
<8-9,Raj>什么
<8-9,Raj>What?

276
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,240
<8-10,Bernadette>真遗憾  拉杰
<8-10,Bernadette>I'm sorry, Raj.

277
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,330
<8-11,Raj>我怎么就找不到我的佳人呢
<8-11,Raj>Why can't I find someone?

278
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,260
<8-11,Raj>我智商高  工作好
<8-11,Raj>I'm smart, I've got a cool job,

279
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,340
<8-11,Raj>天生古铜的肤色说明
<8-11,Raj>and my naturally bronzed complexion means

280
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,470
<8-11,Raj>别人穿了难看的芥末黄  我也能穿得帅气
<8-11,Raj>I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can't.

281
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,460
<8-12,Penny>亲爱的  不怪你  是她们脑子有病
<8-12,Penny>Oh, honey, it's not you, it's them.

282
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,160
<8-12,Penny>不是的
<8-12,Penny>No, it's not.

283
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,460
<8-13,Raj>她太漂亮了  我高攀不上
<8-13,Raj>She was too beautiful for me.

284
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,040
<8-14,Bernadette>-你怎么会说这种话  -是真的
<8-14,Bernadette>- Why would you say that? - It's true.

285
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,970
<8-15,Raj>我总是迷恋自己得不到的姑娘
<8-15,Raj>I'm always attracted to women I can't have.

286
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,490
<8-15,Raj>我老是这样
<8-15,Raj>I do it all the time.

287
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,730
<8-15,Raj>我以前对你们两个就是啊
<8-15,Raj>I did the same thing with the two of you.

288
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,450
<8-16,Amy>她们两个
<8-16,Amy>The two of them?

289
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,810
<8-16,Amy>我不太明白
<8-16,Amy>I don't understand.

290
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,570
<8-17,Raj>曾经有段时间我暗恋过佩妮
<8-17,Raj>Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny,

291
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,090
<8-17,Raj>而且当时我以为她也喜欢我
<8-17,Raj>and I thought she was into me, too,

292
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,420
<8-17,Raj>因为有一次她喝醉后脱光
<8-17,Raj>because she got drunk and naked

293
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,680
<8-17,Raj>跟我爬上了床
<8-17,Raj>and climbed into bed with me.

294
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,730
<8-17,Raj>但很显然是我自作多情了
<8-17,Raj>But apparently I misread those signals.

295
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,030
<8-18,Amy>你也喜欢过伯纳黛特啊
<8-18,Amy>And you liked Bernadette also?

296
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,100
<8-19,Raj>那是在佩妮之前
<8-19,Raj>That was before Penny.

297
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,450
<8-19,Raj>我自己定了个规矩  一次只能
<8-19,Raj>I make it a rule to only fall for

298
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,280
<8-19,Raj>爱上一位好朋友的女朋友
<8-19,Raj>one of my friends' girlfriends at a time.

299
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,360
<8-19,Raj>这方面我挺传统的
<8-19,Raj>I'm very old-fashioned that way.

300
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,130
<8-20,Amy>也就是说你曾经
<8-20,Amy>So at, uh, some point,

301
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,330
<8-20,Amy>也喜欢过我了吧
<8-20,Amy>you probably had a thing for me, too.

302
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,840
<8-21,Raj>那倒没有
<8-21,Raj>No, not really.

303
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,060
<8-22,Penny>拜托  拉杰  一点都没有吗
<8-22,Penny>Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?

304
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,260
<8-23,Raj>反正我想不起来这样过
<8-23,Raj>Not that I can think of.

305
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,150
<8-24,Bernadette>给老娘仔细想
<8-24,Bernadette>Think harder.

306
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,880
<8-25,Raj>没有
<8-25,Raj>Nope.

307
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,110
<8-25,Raj>我的心会跟着心的感觉走吧
<8-25,Raj>I guess the heart wants what the heart wants.

308
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,330
<8-25,Raj>而她不是我的菜
<8-25,Raj>Or in this case, doesn't.

309
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,410
<8-25,Raj>完全没兴趣
<8-25,Raj>I mean, at all.

310
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,530
<8-25,Raj>看我干嘛
<8-25,Raj>What?

311
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,740
<9-1,Sheldon>* 但能济贫士 *
<9-1,Sheldon>* Ye who now will bless the poor *

312
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,280
<9-1,Sheldon>* 赐福自返还 *
<9-1,Sheldon>* Shall yourselves find blessing *

313
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,140
<9-2,Howard>完啦
<9-2,Howard>Done?

314
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,430
<9-3,Sheldon>你想说的唱完赞叹词应该是"棒啊"
<9-3,Sheldon>I think the word you're looking for is "bravo."

315
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,350
<9-4,Leonard>现在你们离开那个房间  发现自己
<9-4,Leonard>Okay, you leave the room and find yourself

316
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,600
<9-4,Leonard>来到一个里面有融化的雪人的池子面前
<9-4,Leonard>standing before a pool of melted snowmen.

317
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,160
<9-5,Sheldon>融化的雪人
<9-5,Sheldon>Melted snowmen?

318
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,310
<9-5,Sheldon>水里有雪人五官的胡萝卜和煤块吗
<9-5,Sheldon>Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?

319
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,920
<9-6,Leonard>不知道  有差别吗
<9-6,Leonard>I don't know. What's the difference?

320
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,640
<9-7,Sheldon>这是个幻想游戏  莱纳德
<9-7,Sheldon>It's a game of the imagination, Leonard.

321
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,520
<9-7,Sheldon>-给我好好描述画面  -好吧
<9-7,Sheldon>- Paint a picture. - Fine.

322
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,060
<9-6,Leonard>你离开那个房间  发现自己
<9-6,Leonard>You leave the room and find yourself

323
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,840
<9-6,Leonard>来到一个里面有融化的雪人的池子面前
<9-6,Leonard>standing before a pool of melted snowmen.

324
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,760
<9-5,Sheldon>水里尽是胡萝卜和煤块
<9-5,Sheldon>There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.

325
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,940
<9-9,Sheldon>那雪人的大帽子和烟斗上哪了呢
<9-9,Sheldon>Do we know what happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?

326
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,420
<9-10,Leonard>你也看见它们在水里了
<9-10,Leonard>You see those, too.

327
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,270
<9-11,Sheldon>真是身临其境呀
<9-11,Sheldon>Oh, it's like I'm really there.

328
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,940
<9-12,Stuart>自从我的治疗师换了我的焦虑症药
<9-12,Stuart>I gotta tell you, this-this is the most holiday fun I've had

329
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,110
<9-12,Stuart>而且我也再也不在乎我的血便后
<9-12,Stuart>since my therapist changed my anxiety medication

330
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,630
<9-12,Stuart>我不得不说  这是我最开心的过节了
<9-12,Stuart>and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.

331
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,680
<9-13,Howard>好故事
<9-13,Howard>Good story.

332
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,640
<9-14,Leonard>你喝什么呢
<9-14,Leonard>What are you drinking there?

333
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,830
<9-14,Leonard>蛋奶酒吗
<9-14,Leonard>Little eggnog?

334
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,760
<9-15,Sheldon>是的
<9-15,Sheldon>Yes.

335
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,730
<9-15,Sheldon>怎么了  不行吗
<9-15,Sheldon>What, is there a problem?

336
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,140
<9-16,Leonard>看你喝圣诞饮品挺好的
<9-16,Leonard>No, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage.

337
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,370
<9-16,Leonard>很有节日氛围
<9-16,Leonard>Pretty Christmasy.

338
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,950
<9-17,Sheldon>蛋奶酒什么时候成圣诞专属了
<9-17,Sheldon>Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink?

339
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,810
<9-17,Sheldon>一年四季都有鸡蛋生产
<9-17,Sheldon>Eggs are available all year 'round.

340
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,410
<9-17,Sheldon>大家都知道我爱在泳池边喝这个
<9-17,Sheldon>I've been known to enjoy this poolside.

341
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,720
<9-17,Sheldon>拜托  谢尔顿
<9-17,Sheldon>Come on, Sheldon.

342
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,330
<9-18,Leonard>你知道每一个圣诞故事  和颂歌
<9-18,Leonard>You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols,

343
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,360
<9-18,Leonard>现在还喝出了个蛋奶酒小胡子
<9-18,Leonard>you've got an eggnog mustache going on there.

344
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,650
<9-18,Leonard>承认吧
<9-18,Leonard>Just admit it.

345
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,250
<9-18,Leonard>你挺喜欢圣诞的
<9-18,Leonard>You're getting a little Yuletide spirit.

346
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,560
<9-19,Sheldon>别傻了
<9-19,Sheldon>Oh, don't be silly.

347
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,650
<9-19,Sheldon>圣诞节只不过是装饰品工业编出来骗钱的
<9-19,Sheldon>Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry.

348
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,490
<9-19,Sheldon>对你来说有什么要紧的啊
<9-19,Sheldon>Why is this so important to you?

349
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,590
<9-20,Leonard>坦白说  因为我小时候的圣诞节都过得很糟
<9-20,Leonard>Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid

350
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,880
<9-20,Leonard>现在不想你再扫我的兴了
<9-20,Leonard>and I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.

351
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,580
<9-21,Stuart>怎么过得不好了
<9-21,Stuart>What was so bad about them?

352
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,430
<9-22,Leonard>我家人都是疯子学术家
<9-22,Leonard>I grew up in a house full of crazy academics.

353
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,640
<9-22,Leonard>我们小孩不给圣诞老人留牛奶和饼干
<9-22,Leonard>Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies,

354
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,940
<9-22,Leonard>而是得留给他一份研究报告
<9-22,Leonard>we had to leave him a research paper.

355
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
<9-22,Leonard>而第二天早晨  你会知道圣诞老人来过
<9-22,Leonard>And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there

356
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,180
<9-22,Leonard>因为你留的报告都评好分了
<9-22,Leonard>because the paper would be graded.

357
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,870
<9-23,Sheldon>怪不得你这么喜欢圣诞节
<9-23,Sheldon>No wonder you love Christmas.

358
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,960
<9-23,Sheldon>听起来真是太酷了
<9-23,Sheldon>That sounds amazing.

359
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,230
<9-24,Leonard>一点也不酷
<9-24,Leonard>It wasn't amazing.

360
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,050
<9-24,Leonard>我曾连续四年得了C-
<9-24,Leonard>I got a C-minus four years in a row.

361
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,740
<9-25,Sheldon>我知道你的水平
<9-25,Sheldon>Yeah, I'm familiar with your work.

362
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,610
<9-25,Sheldon>C-都算送了你大礼了
<9-25,Sheldon>C-minus was your gift.

363
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,980
<10-1,Raj>艾米  真是对不起
<10-1,Raj>Amy, I'm really sorry.

364
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,840
<10-1,Raj>我不是故意让你难过的
<10-1,Raj>I didn't mean to upset you.

365
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,760
<10-1,Raj>没事
<10-1,Raj>It's fine.

366
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,720
<10-2,Amy>我已经习惯被男生无视了
<10-2,Amy>I'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice.

367
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,960
<10-2,Amy>直到22岁  我才等到我的初吻
<10-2,Amy>I didn't have my first kiss till I was 22,

368
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,280
<10-2,Amy>那人亲我是因为我拿他的胰岛素要挟
<10-2,Amy>and the guy only did it so I'd give him back his insulin.

369
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,870
<10-3,Bernadette>有时候  胰腺会跟着胰腺的感觉走
<10-3,Bernadette>Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.

370
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,670
<10-4,Amy>算了
<10-4,Amy>Forget it.

371
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,650
<10-4,Amy>我没指望你们能明白
<10-4,Amy>I don't expect you guys to understand.

372
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,080
<10-4,Amy>我明白
<10-4,Amy>I understand.

373
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,970
<10-5,Raj>七年级我玩"转瓶子"游戏时
<10-5,Raj>In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle

375
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,610
<10-5,Raj>瓶子指向了爱林娜·香卡
<10-5,Raj>and it landed on Alina Shankar.

376
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,700
<10-5,Raj>她说如果我敢靠近她
<10-5,Raj>She said if I came near her,

377
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,890
<10-5,Raj>她就敲碎瓶子捅我
<10-5,Raj>she would break the bottle and cut me.

378
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,530
<10-6,Amy>你觉得这样算悲催吗
<10-6,Amy>You think that's bad?

379
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,260
<10-6,Amy>大学时  我在兄弟会派对上喝到不省人事
<10-6,Amy>In college, I passed out at a frat party

380
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,360
<10-6,Amy>醒来时发现衣服没少  反而更多了
<10-6,Amy>and woke up with more clothes on.

381
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,040
<10-7,Raj>有时候我感觉太孤单
<10-7,Raj>Sometimes I get so lonely,

382
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,320
<10-7,Raj>我会坐在左手上直到左手麻木
<10-7,Raj>I sit on my left hand until it goes numb,

383
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,640
<10-7,Raj>然后用右手握住
<10-7,Raj>then I put it in my right hand

384
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,920
<10-7,Raj>假装是别人在握住我的手
<10-7,Raj>and pretend I'm holding hands with another person.

385
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,660
<10-8,Amy>我也会这么做
<10-8,Amy>I do that, too.

386
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,610
<10-8,Amy>有时候左手想伸伸禄山之爪
<10-8,Amy>Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel.

387
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,850
<10-8,Amy>我也任它随便摸
<10-8,Amy>And I let it.

388
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,140
<10-9,Raj>能和了解孤单的人聊天
<10-9,Raj>It's kind of nice to talk to someone who understands

389
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,940
<10-9,Raj>感觉真是太好了
<10-9,Raj>what it feels like to be alone.

390
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,460
<10-10,Amy>是吧
<10-10,Amy>It is, isn't it?

391
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,760
<10-11,Raj>但你现在不再孤单了
<10-11,Raj>But you're not alone anymore.

392
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,020
<10-11,Raj>-你有谢尔顿  -是的
<10-11,Raj>- Now you've got Sheldon. - I do.

393
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,330
<10-12,Amy>别担心  终有一天你也会有佳人相伴的
<10-12,Amy>And don't worry, someday you'll have somebody, too.

394
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,540
<10-12,Amy>谢谢
<10-12,Amy>Thank you.

395
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,210
<10-13,Raj>她只要有你一半美丽聪慧  我就心满意足了
<10-13,Raj>I hope she's half as lovely and amazing as you are.

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,920
<10-14,Amy>谢谢你  拉杰什
<10-14,Amy>Thank you, Rajesh.

397
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,420
<10-14,Amy>他对我动心了  我满意了  撤
<10-14,Amy>He wants me, I'm good. We can go now.

398
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,550
<10-15,Raj>我靠
<10-15,Raj>Damn it.

399
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,510
<10-16,Penny>怎么了
<10-16,Penny>What?

400
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,750
<10-17,Raj>现在我知道她不喜欢我
<10-17,Raj>Now that I know she doesn't like me,

401
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,530
<10-17,Raj>我好像有点喜欢她了
<10-17,Raj>I'm kind of into her.

402
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,670
<11-1,Sheldon>好了
<11-1,Sheldon>All right.

403
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,870
<11-1,Sheldon>我想我破解了密码  可以放下吊桥了
<11-1,Sheldon>I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.

404
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,660
<11-2,Howard>太好了  开始吧
<11-2,Howard>Great. Let's do it.

405
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,690
<11-3,Leonard>吊桥正在缓缓放下
<11-3,Leonard>The drawbridge is lowering.

406
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,530
<11-4,Stuart>我的腕管综合症发作了
<11-4,Stuart>My carpal tunnel's acting up.

407
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,680
<11-5,Sheldon>痛也得坚持
<11-5,Sheldon>Play through the pain!

408
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,230
<11-6,Leonard>成功了  吊桥放下了
<11-6,Leonard>You did it! The drawbridge is down.

409
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,520
<11-6,Leonard>你们跨过峡谷
<11-6,Leonard>You cross the chasm

410
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,340
<11-6,Leonard>来到一间小小的地牢
<11-6,Leonard>and find yourself in a small dungeon room.

411
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,080
<11-6,Leonard>在墙角  是被铁链锁住
<11-6,Leonard>And in the corner, chained to the wall,

412
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,660
<11-6,Leonard>被打到浑身鲜血的圣诞老人
<11-6,Leonard>you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus.

413
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,110
<11-6,Leonard>他说  "呵  呵  救命"
<11-6,Leonard>He says, "Ho, ho, help me."

414
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,030
<11-7,Howard>太棒了  我们找到了圣诞老人
<11-7,Howard>Yes, we found Santa!

415
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,030
<11-7,Howard>圣诞节被拯救了
<11-7,Howard>Christmas is saved!

416
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,990
<11-7,Howard>千万别告诉我妈我说过这句话[犹太人不过圣诞]
<11-7,Howard>Don't ever tell my mother I said that.

417
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,400
<11-8,Stuart>我取出万能钥匙
<11-8,Stuart>I take out my skeleton key

418
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,200
<11-8,Stuart>跑向圣诞老人给他解开铁链
<11-8,Stuart>and run to Santa to unchain him.

419
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,180
<11-9,Sheldon>但我抢先向斯图尔特和霍华德施了麻痹咒
<11-9,Sheldon>But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.

420
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,920
<11-10,Howard>你这是干嘛
<11-10,Howard>What are you doing?

421
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,060
<11-11,Sheldon>你不能说话  你已经被我麻痹了
<11-11,Sheldon>You can't talk; you're paralyzed.

422
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,790
<11-11,Sheldon>我来到圣诞老人的大肥脸跟前说
<11-11,Sheldon>I get right up in Santa's big, fat face and say...

423
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,670
<11-11,Sheldon>瞧瞧瞧
<11-11,Sheldon>Well, well, well,

424
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,580
<11-11,Sheldon>乐呵呵的圣诞老头儿  我们又见面了
<11-11,Sheldon>Jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again.

426
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,070
<11-11,Sheldon>我相信上次我们聊天
<11-11,Sheldon>Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke

427
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,140
<11-11,Sheldon>还是在德州加尔维斯顿市的溪湾商场
<11-11,Sheldon>was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas,

428
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,390
<11-11,Sheldon>我当时五岁  对吗
<11-11,Sheldon>when I was five years old, isn't that right?

429
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,000
<11-12,Leonard>好吧
<11-12,Leonard>Uh, okay.

430
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,980
<11-13,Sheldon>我妈硬把我拉去
<11-13,Sheldon>My mother dragged me there

431
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,590
<11-13,Sheldon>让我坐在你的大腿上
<11-13,Sheldon>and she plopped me down on your lap

432
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,160
<11-13,Sheldon>你问我圣诞节想要什么
<11-13,Sheldon>and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas.

433
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,300
<11-13,Sheldon>我告诉你  "我要我的外公"
<11-13,Sheldon>And I told you "My Pop-Pop,"

434
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,850
<11-13,Sheldon>因为那年我的外公去世了
<11-13,Sheldon>because that was the year my grandfather died.

435
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,020
<11-13,Sheldon>我想他  我想让他死而复生
<11-13,Sheldon>I missed him and I wanted him back.

436
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,840
<11-14,Leonard>现在有点诡异  对吧
<11-14,Leonard>This is weird, right?

437
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,320
<11-15,Sheldon>家里只有外公一个人
<11-15,Sheldon>Pop-Pop was the only one in my family

438
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,690
<11-15,Sheldon>鼓励我追求科学的真谛
<11-15,Sheldon>who encouraged me to pursue science.

439
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,040
<11-15,Sheldon>但你没让他起死回生  对吗
<11-15,Sheldon>But you didn't bring him back, did you?

440
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,810
<11-15,Sheldon>我得到的礼物是林肯积木
<11-15,Sheldon>Instead, I got Lincoln Logs.

441
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,390
<11-15,Sheldon>用林肯积木可以搭出很多有意思的东西
<11-15,Sheldon>Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs,

442
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,620
<11-15,Sheldon>但是搭不出外公
<11-15,Sheldon>but Pop-Pop ain't one of 'em.

443
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,880
<11-15,Sheldon>你现在竟然敢向我提出要求
<11-15,Sheldon>And now you're here asking me for something--

444
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,100
<11-15,Sheldon>要我救你
<11-15,Sheldon>to save you.

445
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,510
<11-15,Sheldon>抱歉了  圣诞老人先生
<11-15,Sheldon>Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle,

446
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,210
<11-15,Sheldon>今天不能让你如愿了
<11-15,Sheldon>but today's not your day.

447
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,010
<11-15,Sheldon>我要让你死在这里
<11-15,Sheldon>I'm leaving you here to rot,

448
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,650
<11-15,Sheldon>希望食人魔把你吃到尸骨无存
<11-15,Sheldon>and I hope the ogres feast on your bones.

449
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,370
<11-15,Sheldon>我拿起万能钥匙
<11-15,Sheldon>I take the skeleton key,

450
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,220
<11-15,Sheldon>扔进峡谷里
<11-15,Sheldon>and I toss it into the chasm,

451
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,950
<11-15,Sheldon>离开之前  我给了圣诞老人的
<11-15,Sheldon>and on the way out, I give Santa

452
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,650
<11-15,Sheldon>肥果冻肚皮闪电一踹
<11-15,Sheldon>a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!

453
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,650
<11-15,Sheldon>bowl full of jelly  装满果冻的碗  是圣诞歌的歌词
<11-15,Sheldon>形容圣诞老人的肚子

454
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,880
<11-15,Sheldon>好吧
<11-15,Sheldon>Okay.

455
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,160
<11-16,Leonard>沃罗威茨和斯图尔特被麻痹了  圣诞老人死了
<11-16,Leonard>So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa's dead,

456
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,000
<11-16,Leonard>而我居然不和女友上床跑来玩这个
<11-16,Leonard>and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.

457
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,390
<12-1,Sheldon>圣诞老人
<12-1,Sheldon>Santa?

458
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,150
<12-2,Santa>你好  谢尔顿
<12-2,Santa>Oh, hello, Sheldon.

459
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,750
<12-2,Santa>你应该在睡觉啊
<12-2,Santa>You should be asleep.

460
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,290
<12-3,Sheldon>那你就别在靴子上挂铃铛吵人睡觉啊
<12-3,Sheldon>Well, then, you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots.

461
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,340
<12-4,Santa>我想跟你聊聊
<12-4,Santa>I've been wanting to talk to you.

462
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,910
<12-4,Santa>抱歉在你小时候  我让你失望了
<12-4,Santa>I'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy.

463
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,860
<12-4,Santa>我能施展魔法做到不少事
<12-4,Santa>I-I can do a lot of magical things,

464
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,570
<12-4,Santa>但遗憾的是
<12-4,Santa>but unfortunately

465
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,920
<12-4,Santa>我没有能力让你的外公死而复生
<12-4,Santa>bringing your Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.

466
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,670
<12-5,Sheldon>我明白
<12-5,Sheldon>I understand.

467
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,230
<12-6,Santa>但我有特别的礼物送给你
<12-6,Santa>But I-I do have something special for you.

468
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,870
<12-6,Santa>闭上眼
<12-6,Santa>Close your eyes.

469
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,130
<12-7,Sheldon>希望是火车
