1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,010
<1-1,Sheldon>你们有人觉得蜘蛛侠的主题曲很闹心吗
<1-1,Sheldon>Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,430
<1-2,Leonard>那首怎么会让你闹心啊
<1-2,Leonard>Why would it trouble you?

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,800
<1-2,Leonard>那不是你第三喜爱的卡通主题曲吗
<1-2,Leonard>It's, like, your third favorite cartoon theme song.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,330
<1-3,Sheldon>的确是  就排在
<1-3,Sheldon>It is, right behind

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,500
<1-3,Sheldon>* 嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟  G型神探 *
<1-3,Sheldon>* Do do-do do-do, Inspector Gadget... *

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,470
<1-3,Sheldon>以及  * 忍者神龟 *

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,250
<1-3,Sheldon>* 背有龟壳大英雄 *

<1-4,Howard and Raj (together)>* 忍者龟力量 *
<1-4,Howard and Raj (together)>* Turtle power! *

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,960
<1-5,Sheldon>但蜘蛛侠的歌词却唱  "蜘蛛侠
<1-5,Sheldon>However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that "Spider-Man,

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,860
<1-5,Sheldon>蜘蛛侠  蜘蛛能做的他都能"
<1-5,Sheldon>Spider-Man does whatever a spider can."

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,160
<1-6,Howard>那又如何
<1-6,Howard>Yeah, so?

12
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,730
<1-7,Sheldon>但我能想到一堆蜘蛛能做到
<1-7,Sheldon>I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,390
<1-7,Sheldon>而他不能的事
<1-7,Sheldon>that a spider can.

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,380
<1-7,Sheldon>一  爬进你耳朵  死在里面
<1-7,Sheldon>One: crawl in your ear and die.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,330
<1-7,Sheldon>二  不出示护照也能合法离开危地马拉
<1-7,Sheldon>Two: legally leave Guatemala without a passport.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,480
<1-7,Sheldon>三  跟母蜘蛛做爱
<1-7,Sheldon>Three: have sex with a spider.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,860
<1-8,Raj>我们能换一个话题吗
<1-8,Raj>Can we change the subject?

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,920
<1-8,Raj>人家铁汉怕怕蜘蛛
<1-8,Raj>Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,910
<1-9,Howard>是铁汉"犹怕"蜘蛛
<1-9,Howard>It's "heebie-jeebies."

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,110
<1-10,Raj>有个"犹"字  感觉歧视犹太人
<1-10,Raj>I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic.

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,440
<1-10,Raj>我是在想  我们今晚可以来个小电影节
<1-10,Raj>Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,850
<1-10,Raj>主题  把系列搞臭的电影
<1-10,Raj>The theme: movies that killed their franchises.

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,960
<1-11,Leonard>例如《大白鲨4》《印第安纳琼斯4》《超胆侠1》
<1-11,Leonard>Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,730
<1-12,Raj>还有《特工佳丽2  火爆特工》
<1-12,Raj>Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous.

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,170
<1-12,Raj>连我的宝贝桑德拉·布洛克都救不起
<1-12,Raj>I mean, you know a movie's bad

26
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,310
<1-12,Raj>你就知道这烂片有多烂了
<1-12,Raj>when my homegirl Sandy B. can't save it.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,850
<1-13,Leonard>佩妮今晚要工作  我参加
<1-13,Leonard>Penny's working tonight; I'm in.

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,900
<1-14,Howard>我不行  我得跟伯纳黛特
<1-14,Howard>Not me. I'm having dinner

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,690
<1-14,Howard>还有她父母共进晚餐
<1-14,Howard>with Bernadette and her parents.

30
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,020
<1-15,Leonard>有意思  我们都知道你多"爱"这档事
<1-15,Leonard>Fun. We know how much you love that.

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,960
<1-16,Howard>太折磨我了
<1-16,Howard>It's torture.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,080
<1-16,Howard>尤其是跟她爸相处
<1-16,Howard>Especially with her dad.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,650
<1-16,Howard>我们没有任何共同点
<1-16,Howard>We have nothing in common.

34
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,420
<1-17,Sheldon>当我被逼着跟智商低我太多的人聊天时
<1-17,Sheldon>You know what I like to do when I'm forced to speak

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,070
<1-17,Sheldon>你知道我都怎么做吗
<1-17,Sheldon>with those beneath my intellectual station?

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,610
<1-17,Sheldon>我会提出一个有趣的话题
<1-17,Sheldon>I bring up an interesting topic,

37
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,320
<1-17,Sheldon>例如蜘蛛侠与蜘蛛的差别
<1-17,Sheldon>like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,200
<1-18,Howard>谢谢你啊  谢尔顿
<1-18,Howard>Thanks, Sheldon.

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,910
<1-18,Howard>我到时再跟我岳父试试
<1-18,Howard>I'll try that with my father-in-law.

40
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,820
<1-19,Sheldon>你不许用这话题  这是我的招
<1-19,Sheldon>No, you can't use that one. That's mine.

41
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,810
<1-19,Sheldon>试试用这个话题暖场吧
<1-19,Sheldon>Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker.

42
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,990
<1-19,Sheldon>尽管坊间许多谣传  事实上
<1-19,Sheldon>Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place

43
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,570
<1-19,Sheldon>无论从美国本土  阿拉斯加  还是夏威夷
<1-19,Sheldon>in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii

44
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,850
<1-19,Sheldon>你都不可能垂直挖出一条能贯穿地球
<1-19,Sheldon>from which one can dig straight through the center of the earth

45
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,550
<1-19,Sheldon>穿到中国的通道
<1-19,Sheldon>and come up in China.

46
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,990
<1-20,Howard>很好  谢谢啦
<1-20,Howard>Great, thank you.

47
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,580
<1-21,Sheldon>不行  这个你也不许用
<1-21,Sheldon>Actually, you can't have that one either.

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,030
<1-21,Sheldon>这也是个好话题  抱歉啦
<1-21,Sheldon>It's too good. Sorry.

49
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,530
<1-22,Raj>你呢  谢尔顿
<1-22,Raj>What about you, Sheldon?

50
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,790
<1-22,Raj>今晚有任何安排吗
<1-22,Raj>Do you have any plans tonight?

51
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,140
<1-22,Raj>很遗憾  我有呢
<1-22,Raj>Sadly, yes.

52
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,750
<1-23,Sheldon>艾米要拉我去参加一个丧礼
<1-23,Sheldon>Amy's taking me to a memorial service.

53
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,720
<1-23,Sheldon>是她一个有亚洲血统的同事丧礼
<1-23,Sheldon>It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent,

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,090
<1-23,Sheldon>所以我聊天时就打算不经意地提到
<1-23,Sheldon>so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that

55
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,150
<1-23,Sheldon>无论他们从那人的坟挖多深下去
<1-23,Sheldon>no matter how deep they dig his grave,

56
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,730
<1-23,Sheldon>他永远也回不到中国
<1-23,Sheldon>he'll never make his way back to China.

57
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,100
<1-24,Leonard>这应该能让气氛"轻松不少"啊
<1-24,Leonard>That should lighten the mood.

58
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,250
<1-25,Sheldon>哥就是厉害
<1-25,Sheldon>What can I say?

59
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,340
<1-25,Sheldon>总能把丧事变喜事
<1-25,Sheldon>I put the "fun" in funeral.

60
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,490
<1-25,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-25,Sheldon>第六季  第十集

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,910
<2-1,Sheldon>艾米  艾米
<2-1,Sheldon>Amy. Amy.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,820
<2-1,Sheldon>忘了是要去丧礼
<2-1,Sheldon>Oh, right, funeral.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,070
<2-1,Sheldon>艾米
<2-1,Sheldon>Amy.

64
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,220
<2-2,Amy>你来啦  谢尔顿
<2-2,Amy>Hello, Sheldon.

65
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,460
<2-3,Sheldon>我想打银影侠的领带都不行
<2-3,Sheldon>I'm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie,

66
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,980
<2-3,Sheldon>你却可以穿浴袍啊
<2-3,Sheldon>but you can wear a bathrobe?

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,850
<2-4,Amy>我病得太厉害  去不了了
<2-4,Amy>I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.

68
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,190
<2-5,Sheldon>你病啦
<2-5,Sheldon>You're sick?

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,780
<2-5,Sheldon>真可怜
<2-5,Sheldon>You poor kid.

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,320
<2-5,Sheldon>那我走啦
<2-5,Sheldon>Well, see ya.

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,970
<2-6,Amy>谢尔顿  你不留下来照顾我吗
<2-6,Amy>Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?

72
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,470
<2-7,Sheldon>我吗  不啊
<2-7,Sheldon>Me? No.

73
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,470
<2-7,Sheldon>我是"博士生"不是"医生"
<2-7,Sheldon>No, I'm not that kind of doctor.

74
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,860
<2-8,Amy>但是我们的恋爱合同中明确写道
<2-8,Amy>But our relationship agreement clearly states

75
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,010
<2-8,Amy>其中一人若是病了  另一方就得照顾对方
<2-8,Amy>that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.

76
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,990
<2-9,Sheldon>我明白你的疑惑
<2-9,Sheldon>Oh, I see the confusion.

77
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,910
<2-9,Sheldon>那个条款的用意是要
<2-9,Sheldon>No, the intent behind that clause

78
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,590
<2-9,Sheldon>强迫你在我生病的时候照顾我
<2-9,Sheldon>was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill.

79
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,950
<2-9,Sheldon>等你身体好点  就能理解箇中幽默了
<2-9,Sheldon>When you're feeling better, you'll think that's funny.

80
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,110
<2-10,Amy>算了  晚安吧  谢尔顿
<2-10,Amy>Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.

82
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,950
<2-11,Sheldon>我曾白纸黑字地同意过
<2-11,Sheldon>I made a commitment in writing

83
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,070
<2-11,Sheldon>要在这样的情况下照顾你
<2-11,Sheldon>to comfort you in times like this.

<2-13,Sheldon>You're welcome.

88
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,910
<2-13,Sheldon>那咱们速战速决吧
<2-13,Sheldon>Now let's get this over with.

89
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,860
<3-1,Howard>近来如何
<3-1,Howard>So, how have you been?

90

92
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,840
<3-3,Howard>还行就不错了
<3-3,Howard>Fine is good.

93
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,150
<3-3,Howard>还享受退休生活吗
<3-3,Howard>How you liking retirement?

94
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,030
<3-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>还行啦
<3-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>It's fine.

95
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,500
<3-5,Howard>这让我想到
<3-5,Howard>I'm sensing a theme.

96
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,340
<3-5,Howard>您认真想过蜘蛛侠的主题曲内容吗
<3-5,Howard>You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song?

97
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,050
<3-5,Howard>晚餐做得如何了
<3-5,Howard>How's that dinner coming?

98
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,700
<3-6,Bernadette>刚放进去烤  还得好一阵呢
<3-6,Bernadette>I just put it in. It's gonna be a while.

99
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,930
<3-7,Howard>我就爱吃生鸡肉
<3-7,Howard>I like rare chicken.

100
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,480
<3-7,Howard>咱们来大快朵颐吧
<3-7,Howard>Let's do this.

101
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,430
<3-8,Bernadette>会吃死人的
<3-8,Bernadette>You could die.

102
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,650
<3-9,Howard>吃鸡吃死
<3-9,Howard>Death by chicken.

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,150
<3-9,Howard>挺"鸟"的一种死法啊
<3-9,Howard>That's a pretty "fowl" way to go.

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,600
<3-10,Mrs. Rostenkowski>再给你来瓶啤酒  亲爱的
<3-10,Mrs. Rostenkowski>Here's another beer, honey.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,070
<3-11,Mr. Rostenkowski>谢谢
<3-11,Mr. Rostenkowski>Thank you.

106
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,990
<3-12,Howard>罗斯滕科斯基太太
<3-12,Howard>So, Mrs. Rostenkowski,

107
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,640
<3-12,Howard>听说你去大峡谷国家公园玩了
<3-12,Howard>you took that trip to the Grand Canyon.

108
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,720
<3-12,Howard>好玩吗
<3-12,Howard>How was it?

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,180
<3-13,Mrs. Rostenkowski>好玩
<3-13,Mrs. Rostenkowski>It was good.

110
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,020
<3-14,Howard>才意识到原来您是健谈的那个
<3-14,Howard>Had no idea you were the chatty one.

111
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,530
<4-1,Sheldon>102.2华氏度[39度]
<4-1,Sheldon>102.2.

112
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,070
<4-1,Sheldon>跟半小时前一模一样
<4-1,Sheldon>Exactly what it was half an hour ago.

113
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,340
<4-1,Sheldon>好像你一点都不想好转一样
<4-1,Sheldon>It's like you're not even trying to get better.

114
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,510
<4-2,Amy>谢尔顿  流感哪能过半小时就好啊
<4-2,Amy>Sheldon, you don't get over the flu in half an hour.

115
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,480
<4-3,Sheldon>你这种态度怎么好
<4-3,Sheldon>Well, not with that attitude.

116
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,810
<4-4,Amy>我不得不说
<4-4,Amy>I have to say,

117
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,330
<4-4,Amy>我觉得你对病人的态度不够耐心
<4-4,Amy>I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.

118
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,720
<4-4,Amy>抱歉嘛
<4-4,Amy>I'm sorry.

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,330
<4-5,Sheldon>我只是想你能尽快好起来
<4-5,Sheldon>I just want you to get better as soon as possible.

120
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,210
<4-5,Sheldon>抱着这个目标  我要问你个问题
<4-5,Sheldon>And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question.

121
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,100
<4-5,Sheldon>你相信安慰剂效应吗
<4-5,Sheldon>Do you believe in the placebo effect?

122
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,220
<4-5,Sheldon>病人虽然获得无效的治疗  但却"预料"或"相信"治疗有效
<4-5,Sheldon>从而让其症状得到舒缓的现象

123
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,220
<4-6,Amy>当然相信
<4-6,Amy>Of course I do.

124
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,360
<4-6,Amy>很多研究证明了其有效性
<4-6,Amy>There have been many studies proving its validity.

125
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,170
<4-6,Amy>很好
<4-6,Amy>Great.

126
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,200
<4-7,Sheldon>这可能看似是薄荷糖
<4-7,Sheldon>Now, this may look like a Tic Tac...

127
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,420
<4-7,Sheldon>但它其实药效强大  还特别设计成
<4-7,Sheldon>...but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed

128
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,880
<4-7,Sheldon>能治疗疾病的同时  帮你清新口气
<4-7,Sheldon>to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.

129
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,110
<4-8,Amy>谢尔顿  这一点帮助都没有
<4-8,Amy>Sheldon, this isn't helping.

130
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,130
<4-8,Amy>你何不就让我睡一会呢
<4-8,Amy>Why don't you just let me get some rest.

131
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,650
<4-9,Sheldon>你怎么能睡觉呢
<4-9,Sheldon>How can you sleep?

132
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,570
<4-9,Sheldon>为了让你感觉好点  我还有好多事要做呢
<4-9,Sheldon>I'm not done making you feel better.

133
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,870
<4-9,Sheldon>我还得在你额头放一块冷毛巾
<4-9,Sheldon>I still have to put a cold rag on your head,

134
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,110
<4-9,Sheldon>唱歌给你听  帮你在胸口擦伤风膏
<4-9,Sheldon>sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.

135
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,430
<4-10,Amy>你要帮我在胸口擦东西
<4-10,Amy>Y-You want to rub something on my chest?

136
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,730
<4-10,Amy>是啊
<4-10,Amy>Yes.

137
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,780
<4-11,Sheldon>整个胸口都得擦
<4-11,Sheldon>All over it.

138
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,070
<4-12,Amy>或许我们应该从那个开始
<4-12,Amy>Maybe we should start with that.

139
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,310
<4-13,Sheldon>现在你才是个尽责的病人
<4-13,Sheldon>Now you're being a responsible patient.

140
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,560
<4-13,Sheldon>你可能会有些刺激感
<4-13,Sheldon>Now, you may notice some tingling.

141
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,730
<4-14,Amy>不刺激还不要呢
<4-14,Amy>Oh, I'm counting on it.

142
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,200
<5-1,Howard>好了  开动吧
<5-1,Howard>Okay, dig in.

143
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,520
<5-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>慢着
<5-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>Hold up.

144
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,070
<5-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>主  求你降褔我们
<5-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts

145
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,620
<5-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>並降褔你惠赐的这次晚餐
<5-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>which we are about to receive from Thy bounty

146
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,260
<5-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>我们的主基督  阿门
<5-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>through Christ our Lord. Amen.

147
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,840
<5-3,Howard>把我想说的话抢了
<5-3,Howard>Took the words right out of my mouth.

148
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,040
<5-4,Bernadette>爸  你最近有去钓鱼吗
<5-4,Bernadette>So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?

<5-8,Howard>Sure. I can hear it in your voice.

153
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,090
<5-9,Mrs. Rostenkowski>如果他不喜欢  就不会去了
<5-9,Mrs. Rostenkowski>Oh, if he didn't like it, he wouldn't go.

154
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,750
<5-10,Howard>我还真没想到这点
<5-10,Howard>You know, I hadn't thought of that.

155
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,130
<5-10,Howard>救我
<5-10,Howard>Help me.

156
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,680
<5-11,Bernadette>爸  有时间你可以带霍华德一起去啊
<5-11,Bernadette>Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime.

157
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
<5-11,Bernadette>让你们俩有机会更了解对方
<5-11,Bernadette>Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.

158
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,210
<5-11,Bernadette>不  不用了
<5-11,Bernadette>No, no.

159
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,840
<5-12,Howard>我们已经够了解对方了
<5-12,Howard>We know each other well enough.

160
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,280
<5-12,Howard>他整个晚上都在叨叨个不停
<5-12,Howard>He's been talking my ear off all night.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,820
<5-13,Bernadette>华仔  我觉得你会喜欢的
<5-13,Bernadette>Howie, I think you'd have fun.

<5-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>行  就这么定了吧
<5-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>All right, it's settled.

<5-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>-你和我一起去钓鱼  -真好
<5-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>- You and I are going fishing. - Great.

173
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,900
<5-21,Howard>谢谢你落井下石
<5-21,Howard>Thanks for the help.

174
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,420
<6-1,Howard>我从来没去钓过鱼
<6-1,Howard>I've never even been fishing.

175
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,030
<6-1,Howard>场面肯定会很糟糕
<6-1,Howard>This is gonna be a disaster.

176
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,170
<6-2,Raj>如果不想在干某事时看起来笨手笨脚
<6-2,Raj>If you don't want to look foolish doing something,

177
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,790
<6-2,Raj>你就应该多多练习
<6-2,Raj>you should practice.

178
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,920
<6-2,Raj>你知道在邀请你们来我家之前
<6-2,Raj>Do you know how many beef Wellingtons I made by myself

179
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,220
<6-2,Raj>我做了多少次惠灵顿牛排吗
<6-2,Raj>before I invited you guys over?

180
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,910
<6-2,Raj>给你们个提示
<6-2,Raj>I'll give you a hint.

181
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,260
<6-2,Raj>你们可以从这里  这里
<6-2,Raj>You can see them here, here...

182
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,590
<6-2,Raj>还有这里看出来
<6-2,Raj>and here.

183
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,600
<6-3,Leonard>拉杰说得对
<6-3,Leonard>Raj is probably right.

184
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,810
<6-3,Leonard>你应该找人给你些建议
<6-3,Leonard>You should get someone to give you some pointers.

185
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,470
<6-4,Howard>你们俩有谁知道怎么钓鱼吗
<6-4,Howard>Do either of you guys know how to fish?

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,370
<6-5,Leonard>不知道
<6-5,Leonard>No.

187
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,530
<6-6,Raj>不过如果你真钓到鱼
<6-6,Raj>But if you catch anything,

188
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,170
<6-6,Raj>我知道怎么用香蕉叶子包着蒸
<6-6,Raj>I know how to steam it in banana leaves.

189
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,090
<6-7,Howard>拜托  我们肯定有认识
<6-7,Howard>Come on, we must know somebody

190
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,600
<6-7,Howard>懂这种爷们事情的人
<6-7,Howard>who can do manly stuff like this.

191
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,150
<6-7,Howard>干嘛
<6-7,Howard>What's up?

192
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,250
<8-1,Penny>第一步  虫子
<8-1,Penny>Step 1: worms.

193
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,420
<8-2,Howard>恶心死了
<8-2,Howard>Ew!

194
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,200
<8-2,Howard>打住  "恶心死了"这句话
<8-2,Howard>Okay, right there, "ew" is one of the things

195
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,710
<8-3,Penny>你绝对不能再你岳父面前说
<8-3,Penny>you're not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law.

196
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,570
<8-3,Penny>一样娘的还有"真讨厌"和"快拿开"这两句
<8-3,Penny>It's right up there with "icky" and "get it away."

197
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,010
<8-3,Penny>拿条虫子起来
<8-3,Penny>Now pick one up.

198
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,970
<8-4,Howard>真的假的
<8-4,Howard>Really?

199
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,530
<8-5,Penny>你钓鱼的时候就得这么做
<8-5,Penny>You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.

200
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,770
<8-6,Howard>好吧
<8-6,Howard>Okay.

201
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,030
<8-7,Penny>你在等什么啊
<8-7,Penny>What are you waiting for?

202
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,350
<8-8,Howard>不知道  等它们自然死亡了再下手抓嘛
<8-8,Howard>I don't know, for them to die of natural causes.

203
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,350
<8-9,Penny>快点挑一条虫子  然后把它弄到鱼钩上
<8-9,Penny>Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.

204
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
<8-9,Penny>好啦
<8-9,Penny>Fine.

205
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,910
<8-10,Howard>好了
<8-10,Howard>There.

206
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,730
<8-11,Leonard>虽然我不是专家
<8-11,Leonard>I'm no expert,

207
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,590
<8-11,Leonard>但这鱼钩得穿过虫子才行吧
<8-11,Leonard>but I think the hook has to go through the worm.

208
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,860
<8-11,Leonard>好吧
<8-11,Leonard>Fine.

209
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,070
<8-12,Howard>抱歉啦  虫子先生
<8-12,Howard>Sorry, Mr. Worm.

210
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,250
<8-12,Howard>舍尔曼  虫子舍尔曼先生
<8-12,Howard>Sherm. Sherm the Worm.

211
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,790
<8-13,Penny>别给它取名字
<8-13,Penny>Hey, don't name him.

212
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,770
<8-13,Penny>麻利地把鱼钩插穿它脸就对了
<8-13,Penny>Just jab a hook in his face.

213
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,640
<8-14,Raj>你行的  哥们
<8-14,Raj>You got this, buddy.

214
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,680
<8-15,Leonard>是啊  加把油  霍华德  钩穿那条虫
<8-15,Leonard>Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.

215
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,920
<8-16,Raj>你行的
<8-16,Raj>You can do it.

216
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,100
<8-16,Raj>不错啊
<8-16,Raj>That's great.

217
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,460
<8-17,Penny>拉拉队加油  你们仨真够"男性雄风"
<8-17,Penny>Cheerleading-- way to man things up.

218
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,240
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>"随后实验对照组显示了
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>"And the control group displayed

219
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,210
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>基因变异体的大幅减少
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>significantly fewer genetic abnormalities.

220
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,260
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>但由于实验环境的设计
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>But, because of flaws in the experimental design

221
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,600
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>和喂食环节的缺陷
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>relating to environment and diet,

222
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,670
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>它们最终都与世长辞了"
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>they lived inconclusively ever after."

223
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,790
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>剧终
<9-1,Sheldon (reading)>The end.

224
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,770
<9-2,Amy>故事真好听
<9-2,Amy>That was great.

225
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,670
<9-2,Amy>再帮我擦擦胸口吧
<9-2,Amy>Rub my chest again.

226
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,910
<9-2,Amy>不行
<9-2,Amy>No.

227
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,650
<9-3,Sheldon>我得让你睡会儿
<9-3,Sheldon>I need to get you down for a nap.

228
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,240
<9-3,Sheldon>不知怎么  那伤风膏让你像打了鸡血一样
<9-3,Sheldon>For some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up.

229
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,950
<9-4,Bernadette>可怜的小家伙怎么样了
<9-4,Bernadette>How's the poor thing?

230
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,890
<9-5,Sheldon>我还撑着呢  谢谢你的关心
<9-5,Sheldon>Oh, I'm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.

231
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,570
<9-6,Bernadette>艾米  我给你带了点
<9-6,Bernadette>Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs

232
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,390
<9-6,Bernadette>我们实验室正在研发的药
<9-6,Bernadette>we were working on in the lab.

233
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,580
<9-6,Bernadette>这种对鼻塞很有用
<9-6,Bernadette>This is proving really good for congestion,

234
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,620
<9-6,Bernadette>但有很小的可能
<9-6,Bernadette>but there's a slight chance

235
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,360
<9-6,Bernadette>让你的眼泪有强酸的灼烧感
<9-6,Bernadette>it can make your tears burn like acid,

236
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,420
<9-6,Bernadette>吃了药  就求上天保佑吧
<9-6,Bernadette>so if you take it-- happy thoughts.

237
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,670
<9-7,Sheldon>我去帮你放一缸能放松身心的水吧
<9-7,Sheldon>Uh, I'm going to draw you a soothing bath.

238
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,590
<9-7,Sheldon>你的水温计在哪
<9-7,Sheldon>Where's your bath thermometer?

239
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,340
<9-8,Amy>我没有水温计
<9-8,Amy>I don't have a bath thermometer.

240
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,360
<9-9,Sheldon>好吧  那我就帮你放一缸
<9-9,Sheldon>Fine. Then I'm going to draw you

241
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,580
<9-9,Sheldon>让神经紧绷的水温不明水吧
<9-9,Sheldon>a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.

242
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,230
<9-10,Bernadette>这种药的化痰功能很强
<9-10,Bernadette>This is a really good expectorant.

243
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,920
<9-10,Bernadette>不过有些试药员报告说
<9-10,Bernadette>Although some test subjects reported

244
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,890
<9-10,Bernadette>她们听到音乐时会忍不住分泌乳汁
<9-10,Bernadette>lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.

245
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,820
<9-11,Amy>好了  是这么回事
<9-11,Amy>Okay, okay, here's the deal.

246
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
<9-11,Amy>我不需要你的药  我没病
<9-11,Amy>I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.

247
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,110
<9-12,Bernadette>我不太明白
<9-12,Bernadette>I don't understand.

248
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,150
<9-13,Amy>我两天前就好多了
<9-13,Amy>I got better two days ago.

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,400
<9-13,Amy>但谢尔顿把我照顾得太好了  我舍不得
<9-13,Amy>It's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.

250
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,180
<9-14,Bernadette>所以你就一直骗他啊
<9-14,Bernadette>So you've just been lying to him?

251
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,750
<9-15,Amy>看我鼻子的东西
<9-15,Amy>See the stuff in my nose?

252
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,040
<9-15,Amy>那是胶水
<9-15,Amy>Rubber cement.

253
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,710
<9-16,Bernadette>我不是想批评你啦
<9-16,Bernadette>I don't mean to be judgy,

254
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,470
<9-16,Bernadette>但这种事不是只有疯子才会做吗
<9-16,Bernadette>but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.

255
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,470
<9-17,Amy>好吧
<9-17,Amy>All right.

256
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,220
<9-17,Amy>我跟他坦白
<9-17,Amy>I'll tell him.

257
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,460
<9-18,Sheldon (off)>艾米  你有力气自己洗澡吗
<9-18,Sheldon (off)>Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself,

258
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,430
<9-18,Sheldon (off)>还是你需要我帮忙
<9-18,Sheldon (off)>or do you need my help?

259
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,630
<9-19,Amy>我明天再坦白
<9-19,Amy>I'll tell him tomorrow.

260
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,980
<9-19,Amy>老娘想好好洗个澡
<9-19,Amy>Mama needs a bath.

261
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,870
<10-1,Penny>现在我们假设奇迹降临
<10-1,Penny>Now, let's assume, by some miracle,

262
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,740
<10-1,Penny>你真的钓上来一条鱼
<10-1,Penny>you actually catch a fish.

263
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,190
<10-1,Penny>你得知道怎样清理内脏
<10-1,Penny>You're going to have to know how to gut it.

264
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,040
<10-1,Penny>所以你要做的就是
<10-1,Penny>So, what you're going to do

265
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,820
<10-1,Penny>拿起刀
<10-1,Penny>is you're going to take your knife,

266
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,000
<10-1,Penny>从它的肚皮上切下去
<10-1,Penny>slice him right up the belly.

267
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,460
<10-1,Penny>要我停下来吗
<10-1,Penny>You want me to stop?

268
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,170
<10-2,Howard>-不  我没事  你继续  -好
<10-2,Howard>- No, I'm fine. Keep going. - All right.

269
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,360
<10-2,Howard>千万别切得太深
<10-2,Howard>Now, you don't want to cut too deep into its guts,

270
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,820
<10-2,Howard>不然血会溅得你满脸都是
<10-2,Howard>or the blood will just squirt all over your face.

271
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,710
<10-2,Howard>我的天啊
<10-2,Howard>Oh, my God.

272
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,600
<10-2,Howard>你们这群阿宅是怎么回事
<10-2,Howard>What is with you guys?

273
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,610
<11-1,Leonard>不是我们的错啊
<11-1,Leonard>It's not our fault.

274
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,090
<11-1,Leonard>我们的老爸又没和我们做过这些事
<11-1,Leonard>Our dads never did anything like this with us.

275
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,220
<11-2,Penny>从来没有过吗
<11-2,Penny>What, never?

276
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,310
<11-3,Leonard>我爸爸是个人类学家
<11-3,Leonard>My dad was an anthropologist.

277
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,090
<11-3,Leonard>我们唯一的父子活动
<11-3,Leonard>The only father-son time he spent

278
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,320
<11-3,Leonard>都献给那个有两千年历史的
<11-3,Leonard>was with a 2,000-year-old

279
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
<11-3,Leonard>伊特鲁里亚男孩的尸骸了
<11-3,Leonard>skeleton of an Etruscan boy.

280
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,840
<11-3,Leonard>我可讨厌那小子了
<11-3,Leonard>I hated that kid.

281
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,430
<11-4,Raj>我爸只会带我去他的妇科办公室
<11-4,Raj>Mine just took me to his gynecology office.

282
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,820
<11-4,Raj>我甚至无聊到
<11-4,Raj>I got so bored,

283
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,250
<11-4,Raj>把阴道润滑剂涂在鞋底
<11-4,Raj>I'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes

284
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,470
<11-4,Raj>然后幻想我是在滑冰
<11-4,Raj>and pretend I was ice-skating.

285
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,900
<11-5,Howard>我小时候美好的父子时光
<11-5,Howard>Yeah, well, my quality father-son time

286
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,370
<11-5,Howard>都用来盯着窗外
<11-5,Howard>was spending my adolescence looking out the window

287
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,650
<11-5,Howard>等我爸会不会回心转意回家来了
<11-5,Howard>waiting for my dad to come back someday.

288
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,360
<11-6,Raj>好吧  霍华德赢了
<11-6,Raj>Yeah, okay, Howard wins.

289
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,980
<11-7,Leonard>也许我们在长大的过程中
<11-7,Leonard>You know, maybe we didn't have opportunities like this

290
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,520
<11-7,Leonard>没有这样的机会  但现在
<11-7,Leonard>when we were growing up, but right now,

291
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,370
<11-7,Leonard>有位父亲真的要带你去钓鱼了
<11-7,Leonard>there's a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.

292
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,800
<11-7,Leonard>你说得对
<11-7,Leonard>You're right.

293
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,120
<11-8,Howard>-我得好好学  -很好
<11-8,Howard>- I should do this. - Great.

294
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,520
<11-9,Penny>拿着
<11-9,Penny>Here you go.

295
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,770
<11-9,Penny>你现在要做的是
<11-9,Penny>What you're going to do

296
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,810
<11-9,Penny>把你的手指伸进它的喉咙
<11-9,Penny>is you're going to stick your thumb down its throat,

297
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,310
<11-9,Penny>抓住内脏往外拉
<11-9,Penny>grab the guts and pull.

298
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,680
<11-10,Howard>我要动手啦
<11-10,Howard>Here we go.

299
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,190
<11-11,Penny>瞧  这是鱼妈妈  快看她产的卵
<11-11,Penny>Oh, look, it's a female. You can see all the eggs.

300
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,620
<3-12,Howard>* 在阳光下漫步 *
<3-12,Howard>* I'm walking on sunshine *

301
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,360
<3-13,Mrs. Rostenkowski>* 感觉多么爽快 *
<3-13,Mrs. Rostenkowski>* And don't it feel good *

302
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,690
<3-13,Mrs. Rostenkowski>* 感觉多么惬意 *
<3-13,Mrs. Rostenkowski>* And don't it feel good *

303
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,570
<3-13,Mrs. Rostenkowski>谢尔顿  你可算回来了
<3-13,Mrs. Rostenkowski>Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you're back.

304
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,690
<12-1,Amy>我又严重了
<12-1,Amy>Taking a turn for the worst.

305
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,190
<12-1,Amy>我觉得你得再帮我洗个澡
<12-1,Amy>I think I'm going to need another bath.

306
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,660
<12-2,Sheldon>听你这么说真是意外
<12-2,Sheldon>I'm surprised to hear that.

307
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,540
<12-2,Sheldon>那天我担心你怎么一直没有好转
<12-2,Sheldon>See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren't recovering,

308
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,840
<12-2,Sheldon>所以趁你睡觉时
<12-2,Sheldon>so while you were sleeping,

309
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,490
<12-2,Sheldon>取了你的唾液样本  到实验室进行细菌培养
<12-2,Sheldon>I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.

310
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,650
<12-3,Amy>是吗
<12-3,Amy>Oh?

311
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,240
<12-4,Sheldon>结果出来了
<12-4,Sheldon>I got the results back.

312
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,370
<12-4,Sheldon>你有出现如下症状吗
<12-4,Sheldon>Have you developed any of the following symptoms?

313
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,500
<12-4,Sheldon>鼻子变长
<12-4,Sheldon>A growing nose,

314
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,190
<12-4,Sheldon>或是裤子区域有温热感觉
<12-4,Sheldon>or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region?

315
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,650
<12-4,Sheldon>也就是大家熟知的
<12-4,Sheldon>Also known as full-blown

316
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,250
<12-4,Sheldon>"撒谎撒谎  裤裆烧光"
<12-4,Sheldon>"Liar, liar, pants on fire."

317
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,600
<12-4,Sheldon>好啦  好啦
<12-4,Sheldon>All right, all right.

318
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,650
<12-5,Amy>但最开始我真的病了
<12-5,Amy>But I really was sick at the beginning.

319
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,340
<12-5,Amy>只是有你照顾我的感觉真是太好了
<12-5,Amy>It's just been so nice having you take care of me.

320
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,210
<12-6,Sheldon>你骗我  我会伤心的  艾米
<12-6,Sheldon>It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy.

321
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,800
<12-6,Sheldon>我以为我们的关系是建立在信任
<12-6,Sheldon>I thought our relationship was based on trust

322
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,680
<12-6,Sheldon>以及倾向于对我有利的相互欣赏之上
<12-6,Sheldon>and a mutual admiration that skews in my favor.

323
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,580
<12-7,Amy>我很抱歉我这么做了
<12-7,Amy>I feel terrible I did this.

324
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,910
<12-8,Sheldon>尽管这么说我也不好受
<12-8,Sheldon>It pains me to say it,

325
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,910
<12-8,Sheldon>但我觉得惩罚是必须的
<12-8,Sheldon>but I think some form of penalty is in order,

326
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,290
<12-8,Sheldon>以防日后再出现这样的行为
<12-8,Sheldon>so as to discourage this type of behavior in the future.

327
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,430
<12-9,Amy>这无可厚非  那你想怎么惩罚我
<12-9,Amy>I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?

328
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,870
<12-10,Sheldon>在理想世界里  我会把你关在
<12-10,Sheldon>In a perfect world, I'd lock you

329
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,320
<12-10,Sheldon>广场上的围笼里
<12-10,Sheldon>in a stockade in the public square.

330
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,540
<12-10,Sheldon>那可能需要申请准证
<12-10,Sheldon>That probably requires a permit.

331
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,810
<12-11,Amy>可以不允许我
<12-11,Amy>I could not be allowed

332
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,100
<12-11,Amy>参加下一部《星际迷航》电影的首映啊
<12-11,Amy>to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.

333
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,530
<12-12,Sheldon>这惩罚也太重了
<12-12,Sheldon>Oh, that seems overly harsh.

334
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,930
<12-12,Sheldon>你只是向人性弱点屈服
<12-12,Sheldon>You gave in to a human weakness.

335
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,720
<12-12,Sheldon>你又没杀人
<12-12,Sheldon>You didn't kill a man.

336
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,550
<12-12,Sheldon>这惩罚可能有点传统
<12-12,Sheldon>You know, it's a tad old-school,

337
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,550
<12-12,Sheldon>但我哥溜进我爸的卡车
<12-12,Sheldon>but my father was not one to spare the rod

338
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,600
<12-12,Sheldon>偷喝他的驾车威士忌时
<12-12,Sheldon>when my brother would sneak into his truck

339
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,940
<12-12,Sheldon>我爸奉行的是"不打不成材"
<12-12,Sheldon>and drink his driving whiskey.

340
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,710
<12-13,Amy>你是说  你要打我屁屁吗
<12-13,Amy>Are you saying you want to spank me?

341
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,460
<12-13,Amy>我也不想啊
<12-13,Amy>I don't want to.

342
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
<12-14,Sheldon>但我别无选择了啊
<12-14,Sheldon>But it looks like you left me no choice.

343
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,820
<12-15,Amy>的确是
<12-15,Amy>That's true.

344
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,810
<12-15,Amy>我是个非常"淘气"的坏女孩
<12-15,Amy>I've been a very bad girl.

345
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,840
<13-1,Howard>走起  走起  咱们去钓鱼
<13-1,Howard>Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to fish we go.

346
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,340
<13-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>你穿成这样啊
<13-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>That's what you're wearing?

347
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,960
<13-3,Howard>不行吗
<13-3,Howard>No good?

348
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,170
<13-3,Howard>体育用品店的人说
<13-3,Howard>The guy at the sporting goods store

349
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,200
<13-3,Howard>钓鱼就要穿这个
<13-3,Howard>said these are what fishermen wear.

350
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,480
<13-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>在卡通片里差不多
<13-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>Maybe in cartoons.

351
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
<13-5,Howard>真希望在上传照片
<13-5,Howard>Wish I had known that before I posted

352
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,930
<13-5,Howard>到网上前就知道这点
<13-5,Howard>all those pictures on Facebook.

353
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,600
<13-6,Mr. Rostenkowski>好了  出发吧
<13-6,Mr. Rostenkowski>All right, let's hit the road.

354
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,340
<13-6,Mr. Rostenkowski>大早上去猎几只鸭子也不错
<13-6,Mr. Rostenkowski>I wouldn't mind shooting some ducks in the morning.

355
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,440
<13-7,Howard>等等  咱们还要猎东西吗
<13-7,Howard>Wait, now we're shooting things?

356
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,790
<13-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>我喜欢用大口径的子弹
<13-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>I like using a big shell.

357
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,370
<13-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>虽然之后没法吃
<13-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>You can't eat them afterwards,

358
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,990
<13-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>但打爆它们很有趣
<13-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>but it's fun watching them blow up.

359
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,570
<13-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>先生  您邀请我一起去
<13-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>Sir, I'm flattered

360
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,920
<13-9,Howard>我真是受宠若惊
<13-9,Howard>that you invited me,

361
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,230
<13-9,Howard>我真的很想让您接受我
<13-9,Howard>and I really want you to like me,

362
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,290
<13-9,Howard>但是
<13-9,Howard>but...

363
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,050
<13-9,Howard>我想这趟行程不是什么好主意
<13-9,Howard>I don't think this trip is the way to do it.

364
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,540
<13-9,Howard>而且如果上面满是鸭子残骸
<13-9,Howard>And I can't return these things

365
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,950
<13-9,Howard>我也退不了这身行头
<13-9,Howard>if there's chunks of duck all over them.

366
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,020
<13-10,Mr. Rostenkowski>那你为什么同意一起去
<13-10,Mr. Rostenkowski>So, why'd you agree to come?

367
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,050
<13-11,Howard>因为伯纳黛特逼我去
<13-11,Howard>'Cause Bernadette made me.

368
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,930
<13-12,Mr. Rostenkowski>我也尝试不去
<13-12,Mr. Rostenkowski>I tried to back out, too.

369
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,390
<13-12,Mr. Rostenkowski>我老婆也逼我去
<13-12,Mr. Rostenkowski>My wife said I had to go.

370
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,170
<13-13,Howard>真的吗  您老婆也逼你做事吗
<13-13,Howard>Really? Your wife makes you do stuff?

371
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,190
<13-13,Howard>您可是吓人的大个儿警察
<13-13,Howard>You're a big, scary cop.

372
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,530
<13-14,Mr. Rostenkowski>你是个宇航员
<13-14,Mr. Rostenkowski>You're an astronaut,

373
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,290
<13-14,Mr. Rostenkowski>不也一样被老婆牵着鼻子走
<13-14,Mr. Rostenkowski>and your wife makes you do things,

374
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,970
<13-14,Mr. Rostenkowski>而且她只是个小不点
<13-14,Mr. Rostenkowski>and she's only four feet tall.

375
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,440
<13-15,Howard>那我们现在怎么办
<13-15,Howard>So, what do we do now?

376
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,470
<13-15,Howard>她们是要我们出去玩一整个周末呢
<13-15,Howard>They expect us to go away for the weekend.

377
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,220
<13-16,Mr. Rostenkowski>棕榈泉附近有家印式赌场
<13-16,Mr. Rostenkowski>There's an Indian casino near Palm Springs.

378
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,540
<13-16,Mr. Rostenkowski>双骰会玩吗
<13-16,Mr. Rostenkowski>You know how to shoot craps?

379
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,010
<13-17,Howard>不会  但我对骰子游戏也略知一二
<13-17,Howard>No, but I'm not a stranger to dice games.

380
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,460
<13-17,Howard>我是希伯来圣地庙学校的"快艇骰"冠军
<13-17,Howard>I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.

381

383
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,570
