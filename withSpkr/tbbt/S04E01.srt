00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,610
<1-1,Howard>现在是宫保鸡丁
<1-1,Howard>And now the kung pao chicken.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,650
<1-3,Raj>很顺利啊
<1-3,Raj>Smooth.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,150
<1-4,Howard>最后
<1-4,Howard>And finally,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,440
<1-4,Howard>我的木须肉

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,980
<1-6,Howard>菜上齐了  先生们
<1-6,Howard>Oh, there you have it, gentlemen.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,280
<1-6,Howard>整整一桌由机器人上的晚餐
<1-6,Howard>Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,800
<1-7,Raj>而且只花了28分钟
<1-7,Raj>And it only took 28 minutes.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,730
<1-8,Sheldon>是很不错  但我们必须要小心
<1-8,Sheldon>Impressive, but we must be cautious.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,700
<1-9,Howard>-为什么  -今天机器人来上中国菜
<1-9,Howard>- Why?  - Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,820
<1-10,Sheldon>明天就穿越回过去
<1-10,Sheldon>Tomorrow, it travels back in time

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,020
<1-10,Sheldon>谋杀莎拉·康纳
<1-10,Sheldon>and tries to kill Sarah Connor.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,750
<1-11,Leonard>我可不觉得这会发生  谢尔顿
<1-11,Leonard>I don't think that's going to happen, Sheldon.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,330
<1-12,Sheldon>确实没发生过
<1-12,Sheldon>No one ever does.

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,250
<1-12,Sheldon>所以才会发生
<1-12,Sheldon>That's why it happens.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,770
<1-13,Penny (arriving)>嘿  晚餐到了吗
<1-13,Penny (arriving)>Hey. Is the food here?

<1-13,Penny (arriving)>Ooh. What's that?

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,350
<1-14,Howard>亲爱的女士
<1-14,Howard>That, dear lady,

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,330
<1-15,Penny>好酷啊
<1-15,Penny>Ah, cool.

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,090
<1-16,Howard>叫我把酱油递给你
<1-16,Howard>Ask me to pass the soy sauce.

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,810
<1-17,Penny>空间站里有人用机械手打酱油吗
<1-17,Penny>Oh, does that come up much on the space station?

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,080
<1-18,Howard>通常会是亚裔或犹太航天员
<1-18,Howard>Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,290
<1-19,Penny>-好吧  给我酱油  -就来
<1-19,Penny>- All right. Pass the soy sauce.  - Coming up.

<1-21,Leonard>工作如何
<1-21,Leonard>So how's work?

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,580
<1-22,Penny>还不赖吧
<1-22,Penny>Oh, it's not bad.

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,700
<1-22,Penny>有点饿了
<1-22,Penny>Kind of hungry.

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,340
<1-23,Leonard>我们都饿
<1-23,Leonard>Yeah, we all are.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,160
<1-24,Howard>等等就好
<1-24,Howard>Just wait.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,100
<1-25,Sheldon>佩妮  你有想过
<1-25,Sheldon>You realize, Penny, that the technology

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,000
<1-25,Sheldon>这机械臂所蕴含的科技会在某天
<1-25,Sheldon>that went into this arm will one day make

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,660
<1-25,Sheldon>让你这种没有能力的服务员下岗么
<1-25,Sheldon>unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,910
<1-26,Penny>真的吗
<1-26,Penny>Really?

36
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,500
<1-26,Penny>他们会造往你汉堡上吐口水的机器人吗
<1-26,Penny>They're going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?

37
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,040
<1-27,Sheldon>我以为你跟她分手了
<1-27,Sheldon>I thought you broke up with her.

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,590
<1-27,Sheldon>她为什么在这儿
<1-27,Sheldon>Why is she here?

39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,710
<1-28,Howard>好了  搞定
<1-28,Howard>Okay, here we go.

40
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,240
<1-28,Howard>传递酱油

41
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,700
<1-28,Howard>手抬起来
<1-28,Howard>Put out your hand.

42
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,200
<1-29,Penny>真不可思议
<1-29,Penny>That's amazing.

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,060
<1-30,Sheldon>我可不会说不可思议
<1-30,Sheldon>I wouldn't say amazing.

44
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,980
<1-30,Sheldon>最多不过是比《乡村熊狂欢节》里的
<1-30,Sheldon>At best, it's a modest leap forward

46
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,350
<1-30,Sheldon>使用的最基本的科技前进了一小步而已
<1-30,Sheldon>from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,560
<1-31,Howard>嘿  谢尔顿

50
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,460
<1-33,Howard>不  才不是
<1-33,Howard>No, not peace.

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,110
<1-33,Howard>等着
<1-33,Howard>Hang on.

53
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,900
<2-1,Penny>美国航天局知道你用这个作餐巾纸架吗
<2-1,Penny>Does NASA know you're using that thing as a napkin holder?

54
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,490
<2-2,Howard>开玩笑  他们以为这个还在JPL的保险柜里呢
<2-2,Howard>You kidding? They still think it's in a secure locker at JPL.

56
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,010
<2-3,Penny>你偷的
<2-3,Penny>You stole it?

57
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,110
<2-4,Howard>借的
<2-4,Howard>Borrowed.

58
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,990
<2-4,Howard>关键在表现得像把自己的东西带到车上
<2-4,Howard>The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,660
<2-4,Howard>不好意思
<2-4,Howard>Excuse me.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,600
<2-5,Sheldon (phone gives text alert)>然后想到一个很有趣的双关语
<2-5,Sheldon (phone gives text alert)>and she's made a very amusing pun.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,330

<2-5,Sheldon (phone gives text alert)>"I don't care for perchloroethylene,

<2-5,Sheldon (phone gives text alert)>不喜欢乙二醇醚
<2-5,Sheldon (phone gives text alert)>She doesn't like glycol ether.

66

<2-5,Sheldon (phone gives text alert)>听起来就像"亦"
<2-5,Sheldon (phone gives text alert)>Sounds like "either."

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,610
<2-5,Sheldon (phone gives text alert)>"噗-哈-哈"

<2-13,Penny>我一直在问你  "有新鲜事吗"
<2-13,Penny>I have been asking you, "What's new?"

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,300
<2-13,Penny>你居然从来没想过说
<2-13,Penny>and you never thought to go with,

90
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,340
<2-21,Penny>好吧  那你们交流都说什么
<2-21,Penny>Okay, well, what do you communicate about?

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,810
<2-22,Sheldon>我的物理工作和她的神经生物学工作
<2-22,Sheldon>Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology,

92
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,820
<2-22,Sheldon>最新话题是论我们生个孩子的可能性
<2-22,Sheldon>and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.

93
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,050
<2-23,Penny (spits out drink explosively. Howard types. Robot arm hands Penny a napkin)>谢谢
<2-23,Penny (spits out drink explosively. Howard types. Robot arm hands Penny a napkin)>Thank you.

94
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,820
<2-24,Leonard>等等  要孩子
<2-24,Leonard>Wait a minute-- a child?

95
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,900
<2-24,Leonard>你从没见过这女的
<2-24,Leonard>You never see this girl.

96
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,040
<2-24,Leonard>只有电邮短信和推特联系
<2-24,Leonard>You just e-mail and text and Twitter.

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,230
<2-24,Leonard>然后现在就考虑要孩子了
<2-24,Leonard>Now you're considering having a baby?

98
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,690
<2-25,Sheldon>艾米指出通过我俩的结合
<2-25,Sheldon>Amy pointed out that between the two of us,

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,770
<2-25,Sheldon>我们的基因将会有机会
<2-25,Sheldon>our genetic material has the potential

100
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,650
<2-25,Sheldon>制造出前所未有的
<2-25,Sheldon>of producing the first in a line

101
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,440
<2-25,Sheldon>智力超群  仁慈善良的君主
<2-25,Sheldon>of intellectually superior, benign overlords

102
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,370
<2-25,Sheldon>带领人类走向光明未来
<2-25,Sheldon>to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.

103
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,340
<2-26,Howard>我猜想未来的历史学家
<2-26,Howard>I'm guessing that future historians

104
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,540
<2-26,Howard>将会谴责我们不趁这机会杀了谢尔顿
<2-26,Howard>will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.

105
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,800
<2-27,Penny>好吧  我有个问题
<2-27,Penny>Okay, I have a question.

106
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,730
<2-28,Sheldon>请说  佩妮
<2-28,Sheldon>Yes, Penny.

107
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,780
<2-29,Penny>你不喜欢别人碰你
<2-29,Penny>You don't even like people touching you.

108
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,610
<2-29,Penny>你们怎么做爱呢
<2-29,Penny>How are you going to have sex?

109
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,710
<2-30,Sheldon>我们干嘛要做爱
<2-30,Sheldon>Why on earth would we have sex?

110
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,820
<2-31,Penny>亲爱的  你的私处开始发育的时候
<2-31,Penny>Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you?

111
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,230
<2-31,Penny>你妈妈没跟你谈过吗
<2-31,Penny>You know, when your private parts started growing?

112
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,470
<2-32,Sheldon>我很清楚人类繁殖的方式
<2-32,Sheldon>I'm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce,

113
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,530
<2-32,Sheldon>既脏乱又不卫生
<2-32,Sheldon>Which is messy, unsanitary,

114
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,690
<2-32,Sheldon>而且跟你做了三年邻居
<2-32,Sheldon>And based on living next to you for three years,

115
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,250
<2-32,Sheldon>听了太多不必要又响亮的呼唤神
<2-32,Sheldon>Involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.

116
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,900
<2-33,Penny>天呐
<2-33,Penny>Oh, God.

117
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,600
<2-33,Penny>对  就是这句
<2-33,Penny>Yes, exactly.

118
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,830
<2-34,Sheldon>因此  如果艾米和我
<2-34,Sheldon>Consequently, if Amy and I choose

119
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,470
<2-34,Sheldon>选择让一个新生命降临
<2-34,Sheldon>to bring new life into this world,

120
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,310
<2-34,Sheldon>我们会让生育专家
<2-34,Sheldon>It will be accomplished clinically,

121
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,440
<2-34,Sheldon>在实验室用培养皿受精
<2-34,Sheldon>with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes.

122
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,470
<2-34,Sheldon>这倒提醒我
<2-34,Sheldon>Which reminds me--

123
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,500
<2-34,Sheldon>你不仅屁股大  而且头脑简单  精力充沛
<2-34,Sheldon>you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigor.

124
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,450
<2-34,Sheldon>你的子宫可以代孕吗
<2-34,Sheldon>Is your womb available for rental?

125
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,690
<2-35,Leonard>还想深入八一八谢米恋吗
<2-35,Leonard>Still digging the Shamy?

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,890
<2-36,Penny>谢尔顿
<2-36,Penny>Look, Sheldon,

127
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,970
<2-36,Penny>先别急着选孕育科
<2-36,Penny>before you race off to the fertility clinic,

128
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,180
<2-36,Penny>你也可以考虑
<2-36,Penny>you might want to think about--

129
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,260
<2-36,Penny>老天  怎么说呢
<2-36,Penny>uh, gee, I don't know--

130
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,050
<2-36,Penny>切实地花点时间陪她
<2-36,Penny>maybe actually spending some time with her.

131
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,050
<2-37,Sheldon>-你是说约会  -没错
<2-37,Sheldon>- You mean dating?  - Yeah.

132
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,630
<2-39,Sheldon>-我不能和艾米约会  -为什么
<2-39,Sheldon>- I can't date Amy.  - Why not?

133
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,600
<2-41,Sheldon>她不是我女朋友
<2-41,Sheldon>She's not my girlfriend.

134
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,750
<2-42,Penny>不要把它当成和女朋友约会
<2-42,Penny>Okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend.

135
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,070
<2-42,Penny>把它当成
<2-42,Penny>Think of it as, uh...

136
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,700
<2-42,Penny>了解你孩子的未来妈妈
<2-42,Penny>Getting to know the future mother of your child.

137
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,030
<2-43,Sheldon>我还真没想到
<2-43,Sheldon>I hadn't considered that.

138
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,670
<2-43,Sheldon>她将来应该会接触我们的后代
<2-43,Sheldon>I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny.

139
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,250
<2-43,Sheldon>你觉得通过短信息
<2-43,Sheldon>And you don't think I can achieve

140
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,480
<2-43,Sheldon>我无法达到必要的亲密吗
<2-43,Sheldon>the required intimacy via text messaging?

141
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,790
<2-44,Penny>应该不能
<2-44,Penny>Probably not.

142
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,620
<2-45,Sheldon>看来电话公司一直在骗我
<2-45,Sheldon>It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.

143
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,190
<3-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<3-1,Sheldon>Penny.

144
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,480
<3-1,Sheldon>佩妮  佩妮
<3-1,Sheldon>Penny. Penny.

145
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,160
<3-2,Penny>你应该知道我站在门的另一边
<3-2,Penny>You do realize I stand on the other side of the door

146
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,980
<3-2,Penny>等你敲完三次门吧
<3-2,Penny>waiting for you to finish knocking three times.

147
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,590
<3-3,Sheldon>我知道  我能从门缝看到脚的影子
<3-3,Sheldon>I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.

148
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,570
<3-4,Penny>重点是敲三次很浪费时间
<3-4,Penny>Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.

149
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,880
<3-5,Sheldon>如果你想找个
<3-5,Sheldon>If you're looking for an example

150
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,590
<3-5,Sheldon>浪费时间的例子
<3-5,Sheldon>of a waste of time, I would refer you

151
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,820
<3-5,Sheldon>我们现在的话题就很浪费时间
<3-5,Sheldon>to the conversation we're having right now.

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,050
<3-6,Penny>你有事吗
<3-6,Penny>What do you want?

153
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,710
<3-7,Sheldon>我决定了接受你的建议
<3-7,Sheldon>I've decided to take your advice and have arranged

154
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,960
<3-7,Sheldon>还安排了跟艾米约会
<3-7,Sheldon>to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.

155
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,000
<3-8,Penny>那太好了
<3-8,Penny>Oh, that's great.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,850
<3-8,Penny>-玩得开心  -等等
<3-8,Penny>- Have fun.  - Wait.

157
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,730
<3-9,Sheldon>你要载我去
<3-9,Sheldon>You have to drive me.

158
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,850
<3-11,Sheldon>-什么  -你知道我不开车
<3-11,Sheldon>- What?  - You know I don't drive.

159
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,690
<3-12,Penny>-去问莱纳德  -问了
<3-12,Penny>- Well, go ask Leonard.  - I did.

160
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,020
<3-13,Sheldon>他说  我复述  问问佩妮
<3-13,Sheldon>He said-- and I quote-- "Ask Penny.

161
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,210
<3-13,Sheldon>那是她的可笑主意
<3-13,Sheldon>It was her cockamamy idea."

162
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,800
<3-14,Penny>莱纳德说"可笑"?
<3-14,Penny>Leonard said "cockamamy"?

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,710
<3-15,Sheldon>好吧  那是我说的
<3-15,Sheldon>Actually, I'm paraphrasing.

164
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,400
<3-15,Sheldon>在基督教家庭长大
<3-15,Sheldon>Having been raised in a Christian household,

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,040
<3-15,Sheldon>我实在不习惯他的用语
<3-15,Sheldon>I'm uncomfortable with the language he used.

166
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,710
<3-15,Sheldon>老实说
<3-15,Sheldon>And to be honest,

167
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,390
<3-15,Sheldon>其实我也不喜欢"可笑"这个词
<3-15,Sheldon>I'm not entirely comfortable with "cockamamy."

168
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,510
<3-16,Penny>好吧  什么时候约会
<3-16,Penny>Okay, fine. When's the date?

169
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,180
<3-17,Sheldon>-现在  -现在?
<3-17,Sheldon>- Now.  - Now?

170
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,960
<3-19,Sheldon>快点  我们要迟到了
<3-19,Sheldon>Hurry. We're going to be late.

171
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,780
<3-20,Penny>谢尔顿  你有没有想过
<3-20,Penny>Sheldon, did it ever occur to you

172
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,970
<3-20,Penny>我可能有别的事要忙吗
<3-20,Penny>that I might have other plans?

173
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,940
<3-20,Penny>对不起
<3-20,Penny>I'm sorry.

174
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,150
<3-21,Sheldon>你有别的事忙吗
<3-21,Sheldon>Do you have other plans?

175
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,190
<3-22,Penny>倒是没有  不过
<3-22,Penny>Well, no, not per se, but...

176
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,230
<3-23,Sheldon>这么说这个话题
<3-23,Sheldon>So this conversation is as pointless

177
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,770
<3-23,Sheldon>跟你的敲门独白一样没意义咯
<3-23,Sheldon>as your door-knocking soliloquy?

178
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,330
<3-24,Penny>我去拿我的可笑钥匙
<3-24,Penny>Let me get my... cockamamy keys.

179
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,510
<4-1,Howard>天呐  太爽了
<4-1,Howard>Oh, God, that feels so good.

180
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,920
<4-1,Howard>对  就是那里
<4-1,Howard>Yeah, that's the spot.

181
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,680
<4-1,Howard>宝贝儿
<4-1,Howard>Oh, baby.

182
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,600
<4-2,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>霍华德  吃饭啦
<4-2,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Howard, dinner's ready!

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,510
<4-3,Howard>我一会再吃
<4-3,Howard>I'll eat later.

184
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,240
<4-3,Howard>现在很忙
<4-3,Howard>I'm busy!

185
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,140
<4-3,Howard>爽啊
<4-3,Howard>Oh, yeah.

186
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,180
<4-3,Howard>就跟人手一样
<4-3,Howard>Just like a real hand.

187
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,000
<5-1,Sheldon>谢谢你载我去
<5-1,Sheldon>Thank you for driving me.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,520
<5-2,Penny>不客气
<5-2,Penny>You're welcome.

189
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,520
<5-3,Sheldon>但我希望你不穿人字拖
<5-3,Sheldon>I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops.

190
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,740
<5-3,Sheldon>穿人字拖开车很危险
<5-3,Sheldon>It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops.

191
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,350
<5-4,Penny>-谢尔顿  -对不起
<5-4,Penny>- Sheldon.  - Sorry.

192
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,560
<5-5,Sheldon>我只是不想成为另一个人字拖的受害者
<5-5,Sheldon>I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.

193
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,950
<5-6,Penny>我能问个问题吗
<5-6,Penny>Can I ask you a question?

194
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,850
<5-7,Sheldon>鉴于你的社区大学学历
<5-7,Sheldon>Given your community college education,

195
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,130
<5-7,Sheldon>我鼓励你尽量多问
<5-7,Sheldon>I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.

196
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,200
<5-8,Penny>好  我的问题是
<5-8,Penny>Yeah. Well, my question is--

197
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,860
<5-8,Penny>其实我很清楚答案
<5-8,Penny>and I'm pretty sure I know the answer--

198
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,770
<5-8,Penny>这是你第一次约会吗
<5-8,Penny>Is this your first date?

199
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,830
<5-9,Sheldon>那得看情况
<5-9,Sheldon>That depends.

200
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,910
<5-9,Sheldon>跟我妹在国庆日
<5-9,Sheldon>Does square-dancing with my sister

201
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,550
<5-9,Sheldon>青年敬耶稣方块舞会上
<5-9,Sheldon>at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown

202
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,090
<5-9,Sheldon>跳舞算吗
<5-9,Sheldon>count as a date?

203
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,360
<5-10,Penny>不算
<5-10,Penny>No.

204
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,270
<5-11,Sheldon>那这是我第一次约会
<5-11,Sheldon>Then, this is my first date.

205
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,380
<5-12,Penny>那有几件事
<5-12,Penny>Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things

206
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,250
<5-12,Penny>你应该要知道
<5-12,Penny>you should probably know.

207
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,170
<5-13,Sheldon>我有一个硕士学位和两个博士学位
<5-13,Sheldon>I have a master's degree and two doctorates.

208
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,240
<5-13,Sheldon>我应该知道的事  我都知道
<5-13,Sheldon>The things I should know, I do know.

209
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,680
<5-14,Penny>我的意思是  我比你更清楚约会
<5-14,Penny>My point is, I know more about dating than you,

210
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,360
<5-14,Penny>而且如果你真有你认为的那么聪明
<5-14,Penny>and if you were as smart as you think you are,

211
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,990
<5-14,Penny>你就会听我的话
<5-14,Penny>you would listen to me.

212
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,870
<5-15,Sheldon>如果你是约会专家  那怎么我今晚有约会
<5-15,Sheldon>If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight

213
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,080
<5-15,Sheldon>而你只能当我的司机呢
<5-15,Sheldon>and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?

214
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,530
<5-16,Penny>说得好
<5-16,Penny>Fair point.

215
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,650
<6-1,Raj>《水行侠》的有些问题我想不明白
<6-1,Raj>You know, there's something I've always wondered about Aquaman.

216
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,020
<6-3,Raj>-什么  -他去哪便便
<6-3,Raj>- Yeah?  - Where does he poop?

217
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,720
<6-4,Leonard>什么
<6-4,Leonard>What?

218
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,380
<6-5,Raj>亚特兰蒂斯的马桶长什么样
<6-5,Raj>What would a toilet look like in Atlantis?

219
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,310
<6-5,Raj>你怎么冲掉呢
<6-5,Raj>How would you flush it?

220
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,190
<6-5,Raj>就算你冲掉了  便便又能冲去哪呢
<6-5,Raj>And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,680
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>一会儿再讨论
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>Hold that thought.

222
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,430
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>喂  霍华德  怎么了
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>Hey, Howard. What's going on?

223
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,600
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>啥
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>What...

224
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,010
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>等等  霍华德  慢点说
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>Hold on. Howard, Howard, slow down.

225
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,590
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>机械手卡在你的什么上了
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>The robot hand is stuck on your what?

226
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,340
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>说出来肯定吓你一跳
<6-6,Leonard (phone rings)>You're not going to believe this.

227
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,730
<7-1,Penny>艾米  听谢尔顿说
<7-1,Penny>So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me

228
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,880
<7-1,Penny>你是一个神经...什么来着
<7-1,Penny>you're a neuro... something-or-other.

229
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,220
<7-2,Amy>是神经生物学家
<7-2,Amy>Neurobiologist.

230
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,660
<7-2,Amy>你车的"检查引擎"灯亮了
<7-2,Amy>Your "check engine" light is on.

231
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,890
<7-3,Penny>噢  不管它
<7-3,Penny>Yeah, it's okay.

232
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,900
<7-4,Amy>但如果灯亮了就说明...
<7-4,Amy>But the light indicates...

233
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,260
<7-5,Sheldon>不用费心了
<7-5,Sheldon>Don't bother.

234
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,940
<7-5,Sheldon>我已经浪费太多时间
<7-5,Sheldon>I've wasted many an hour

235
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,610
<7-5,Sheldon>攻击这座顽固的风车了
<7-5,Sheldon>tilting at that particular windmill.

236
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,590
<7-6,Penny>你用的什么香水吗
<7-6,Penny>Uh, what is that scent you're wearing?

237

<7-6,Penny>真好闻

241
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,340
<7-9,Amy>你是同性恋么
<7-9,Amy>Are you a homosexual?

242
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,330
<7-10,Penny>当然不  我只是赞美你而已
<7-10,Penny>No, no, I'm just giving you a compliment.

243
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,880
<7-11,Amy>要你是同性恋  赞美不听着更由衷吗
<7-11,Amy>Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.

244
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,670
<7-12,Penny>那啥  来点音乐怎样
<7-12,Penny>Guys, how 'bout some music?

245
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,840
<7-13,Sheldon>哦不  我可不想要
<7-13,Sheldon>Oh, no, I wouldn't care for that.

246
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,480
<7-13,Sheldon>艾米  你呢
<7-13,Sheldon>Amy?

247
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,220
<7-14,Amy>我也是  谢了
<7-14,Amy>No, thank you.

248
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,510
<7-14,Amy>好吧
<7-14,Amy>Okay.

249
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,100
<7-15,Penny>那就诡异地沉默着吧
<7-15,Penny>Uncomfortable silence it is.

250
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,290
<7-15,Penny>谢尔顿  你有没有告诉艾米
<7-15,Penny>Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy

251
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,090
<7-15,Penny>你小时候在德州长大的经历
<7-15,Penny>what it was like for you growing up in Texas?

252
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,440
<7-16,Sheldon>没有
<7-16,Sheldon>No.

253
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,760
<7-17,Penny>哎  为什么不告诉她
<7-17,Penny>Well, why don't you tell her?

254
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,580
<7-18,Sheldon>好吧
<7-18,Sheldon>All right.

255
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,700
<7-18,Sheldon>痛苦得要死
<7-18,Sheldon>It was hell.

256
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,550
<7-19,Penny>艾米  有什么想法么
<7-19,Penny>Any follow up, Amy?

257
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,220
<7-20,Amy>没有
<7-20,Amy>No.

258
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,630
<7-21,Penny>我在内布拉斯加州长大
<7-21,Penny>I myself grew up in Nebraska.

259
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,410
<7-21,Penny>奥马哈郊外的一个小镇
<7-21,Penny>Small town outside of Omaha.

260
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,560
<7-21,Penny>很好的地方  大多是家庭农场  还有些制毒窝点
<7-21,Penny>Nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.

261
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,290
<7-22,Sheldon>不好意思  这样还不如诡异地沉默呢
<7-22,Sheldon>I'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?

262
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,310
<7-23,Penny>我也不知道  不过是试着找点话题
<7-23,Penny>I don't know. I was just trying something.

263
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,740
<7-24,Sheldon>麻瓜一个[此处引用《哈利波特》里的说法]
<7-24,Sheldon>Muggles.

264
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,960
<8-1,Raj>你是滑倒摔进机械手里的吗
<8-1,Raj>You slipped and fell into a robot hand?

265
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,300
<8-2,Howard>对
<8-2,Howard>Yes.

266
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,040
<8-3,Raj>鸡鸡先着地
<8-3,Raj>Penis first?

267
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,240
<8-4,Howard>对  快帮我
<8-4,Howard>Yes. Now, help me!

268
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,830
<8-5,Leonard>我本来想建议用润滑剂
<8-5,Leonard>I'd suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling

269
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,920
<8-5,Leonard>但我想其实你已经栽在润滑剂里了
<8-5,Leonard>you fell on some of that as well.

270
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,630
<8-6,Howard>不好笑  莱纳德
<8-6,Howard>Not funny, Leonard.

271
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,520
<8-7,Raj>是吗  一个机械手卡在你小弟弟上
<8-7,Raj>Really? A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk, dude.

272
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,410
<8-7,Raj>这还不好笑吗  不信你问别人
<8-7,Raj>That's funny, ask anyone.

273
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,080
<8-8,Howard>拜托  趁我妈还没进来  快把这玩意弄掉
<8-8,Howard>Plea-- before my mother walks in, get this off me!

274
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,120
<8-9,Leonard>唔  我看看
<8-9,Leonard>Okay, let's see.

275
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,010
<8-10,Howard>别  别碰电脑
<8-10,Howard>No, no! Don't touch.

276
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,070
<8-10,Howard>程序暂停了
<8-10,Howard>The program is paused.

277
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,400
<8-11,Leonard>那就重新启动呗
<8-11,Leonard>Well, then let's un-pause it.

278
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,670
<8-12,Howard>别  导入错误的程序
<8-12,Howard>No, no! I loaded the wrong program.

279
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,580
<8-12,Howard>这玩意以为自己在外太空握着把螺丝刀呢
<8-12,Howard>The hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space.

280
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,270
<8-12,Howard>要是程序继续  它就要开始扭了
<8-12,Howard>If you continue the program, it's gonna start twisting.

281
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,880
<8-12,Howard>好吧
<8-12,Howard>A-All right.

282
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,530
<8-13,Raj>这样如何
<8-13,Raj>Um, how about this.

283
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,480
<8-13,Raj>小熊维尼的脑袋卡在蜂蜜树上时
<8-13,Raj>When-when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck

284
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,500
<8-13,Raj>他的伙伴们就会上去拉住他
<8-13,Raj>in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him

285
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,170
<8-13,Raj>然后往外拔啊拔啊拔
<8-13,Raj>and pulled and pulled.

286
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,450
<8-14,Leonard>你爱咋咋地
<8-14,Leonard>You do what you want,

287
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,090
<8-14,Leonard>我可不想碰其他男人的"蜂蜜树"
<8-14,Leonard>I'm not touching another man's honey tree.

288
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,550
<8-15,Raj>好吧  不拔了
<8-15,Raj>All right, uh, forget pulling.

289
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,190
<8-15,Raj>那就找把电锯  直接锯掉
<8-15,Raj>How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?

290
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,990
<8-16,Howard>啥  不准用电锯
<8-16,Howard>What?! No saws!

291
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,140
<8-16,Howard>一个包皮环切还不够吗
<8-16,Howard>One circumcision was enough.

292
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,650
<8-17,Leonard>那乙快焊炬呢
<8-17,Leonard>How about an acetylene torch?

293
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,420
<8-18,Howard>好吧  不敢相信我还要声明这些
<8-18,Howard>Okay, I can't believe this needs to be said out loud.

294
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,810
<8-18,Howard>不准拔  不准用电锯和焊炬
<8-18,Howard>No pulling, no saws, no torches.

295
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,420
<8-19,Leonard>那你要我们做啥
<8-19,Leonard>Well, then what do you want us to do?

296
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,820
<8-21,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>霍华德  我做了饼干
<8-21,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Howard, I made cookies for you

297
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,280
<8-21,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>给你和你的小伙伴
<8-21,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>and your little friends!

298
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,750
<8-22,Howard>好极了  老妈  多谢
<8-22,Howard>That's great, Mom, thanks!

299
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,580
<8-23,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我送上来  再带点夏威夷宾治酒
<8-23,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I'll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!

300
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,960
<8-24,Howard>别上来
<8-24,Howard>Don't come up here!

301
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,190
<8-25,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>干嘛  看不起你妈吗
<8-25,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!

302
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,590
<8-26,Howard>话是没错  但这不是关键
<8-26,Howard>Yes, but that's not the point!

303
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,710
<8-26,Howard>快帮帮忙
<8-26,Howard>Get me out of here.

304
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,860
<8-27,Leonard>你有想法吗  拉杰
<8-27,Leonard>You have any ideas, Raj?

305
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,790
<8-28,Raj>现在啊  我满脑子都是饼干和夏威夷宾治酒
<8-28,Raj>Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

306
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,300
<9-1,Penny>好吧  换个话题
<9-1,Penny>Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation.

307
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,310
<9-1,Penny>今晚是谢尔顿的盛大之夜啊
<9-1,Penny>This is a big night for Sheldon.

308
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,480
<9-1,Penny>是吧  谢尔顿
<9-1,Penny>Right, Sheldon?

309
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,090
<9-2,Sheldon>盛大
<9-2,Sheldon>Big night?

310
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,530
<9-2,Sheldon>冬至日的夜晚才叫大
<9-2,Sheldon>The winter solstice is a big night.

311
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,210
<9-2,Sheldon>在南加利福尼亚
<9-2,Sheldon>It's over 14 hours

312
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,180
<9-2,Sheldon>一共有整整14小时呢
<9-2,Sheldon>in Southern California.

313
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,440
<9-3,Amy>这句话仿得真有意思
<9-3,Amy>That's an amusing factoid.

314
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,290
<9-4,Sheldon>谢谢
<9-4,Sheldon>Thank you.

315
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,520
<9-4,Sheldon>不
<9-4,Sheldon>No, no.

316
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,230
<9-5,Penny>我是说  今晚是谢尔顿第一次正式约会
<9-5,Penny>My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon's first official date.

317
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,900
<9-5,Penny>你们继续吧
<9-5,Penny>Discuss.

318
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,310
<9-6,Amy>真的吗
<9-6,Amy>Is this true?

319
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,420
<9-7,Sheldon>当然  在国庆日上的青年敬基督
<9-7,Sheldon>Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus

320
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,240
<9-7,Sheldon>方块舞会上的那次半乱伦约会不算
<9-7,Sheldon>Fourth of July Hoedown didn't count.

321
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,260
<9-8,Penny>艾米  那你呢
<9-8,Penny>So, um, Amy, what about you?

322
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,190
<9-8,Penny>你约会过吗
<9-8,Penny>Do you date much?

323
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,470
<9-9,Amy>一年一次
<9-9,Amy>Once a year.

324
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,520
<9-9,Amy>我和我妈说好了
<9-9,Amy>It's a deal I made with my mother

325
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,640
<9-9,Amy>这样她就不唠叨这事
<9-9,Amy>in exchange for her silence on the matter,

326
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,680
<9-9,Amy>还可以偶尔用她的乔治·富曼烤架
<9-9,Amy>as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill

327
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,530
<9-9,Amy>锁住美味  没有脂肪
<9-9,Amy>that seals in the flavor without the fat.

328
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,890
<9-9,Amy>你呢  佩妮
<9-9,Amy>How about you, Penny?

329
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,400
<9-9,Amy>你约会过很多次吗
<9-9,Amy>Do you go on many dates?

330
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,160
<9-10,Penny>其实也没有很多次啦
<9-10,Penny>Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many.

331
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,510
<9-10,Penny>有几个吧
<9-10,Penny>A few.

332
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,190
<9-10,Penny>这算啥表情
<9-10,Penny>What's...?

333
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,970
<9-11,Sheldon>你把约171个不同男人描述为"有几个"
<9-11,Sheldon>Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as "A few."

334
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,420
<9-11,Sheldon>什么
<9-11,Sheldon>What...

335
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,520
<9-12,Penny>你怎么算的171个
<9-12,Penny>Where did you get 171 men?

336
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,140
<9-13,Sheldon>简单的推断
<9-13,Sheldon>Simple extrapolation.

337
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,980
<9-13,Sheldon>我认识你的这三年来
<9-13,Sheldon>In the three years that I've known you,

338
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,440
<9-13,Sheldon>你有两年是单身
<9-13,Sheldon>you were single for two.

339
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,400
<9-13,Sheldon>在那两年里  你跟17名追求者约会过
<9-13,Sheldon>During that time, I saw 17 different suitors.

340
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,700
<9-13,Sheldon>往前倒推的话  请纠正如果观察有误
<9-13,Sheldon>If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias

341
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,230
<9-13,Sheldon>并假设你初次约会年龄为15岁
<9-13,Sheldon>and postulate an initial dating age of 15

342
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,030
<9-14,Penny>等等  等等
<9-14,Penny>Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

343
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,720
<9-14,Penny>我才不是15岁开始约会的
<9-14,Penny>I did not start dating at 15.

344
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,870
<9-15,Sheldon>抱歉  十六岁
<9-15,Sheldon>I'm sorry. Sixteen?

345
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,550
<9-15,Sheldon>十四
<9-15,Sheldon>Fourteen.

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,930
<9-17,Sheldon>我的错
<9-17,Sheldon>My mistake.

347
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,610
<9-17,Sheldon>假设钟形曲线的左半部分在目前达到峰值
<9-17,Sheldon>Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present,

348
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,910
<9-17,Sheldon>那就是说总数为193人
<9-17,Sheldon>that would bring the total up to 193 men.

349
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,040
<9-17,Sheldon>正负8人
<9-17,Sheldon>Plus or minus eight men.

350
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,530
<9-18,Amy>太厉害了
<9-18,Amy>Remarkable.

351
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,250
<9-18,Amy>你跟这些人都有过性关系吗
<9-18,Amy>Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?

352
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,170
<9-19,Penny>没有
<9-19,Penny>No.

353
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,090
<9-20,Sheldon>这个数字要算的话也相当简单
<9-20,Sheldon>Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.

354
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,590
<9-22,Sheldon>基于我早上在她公寓门口尴尬邂逅
<9-22,Sheldon>Based on the number of awkward encounters I've had

355
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,030
<9-22,Sheldon>陌生过夜男士的数量
<9-22,Sheldon>with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning,

356
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,280
<9-22,Sheldon>加上遇见她穿着前晚衣服
<9-22,Sheldon>plus the number of times she's returned home wearing the same clothes

357
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,440
<9-22,Sheldon>早上回家的次数
<9-22,Sheldon>she wore the night before...

358
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,140
<9-23,Penny>好了  谢尔顿  我们都明白你意思了
<9-23,Penny>Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.

359
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,740
<9-24,Sheldon>那就是193人
<9-24,Sheldon>So we multiply 193--

360
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,480
<9-24,Sheldon>减去她失去童贞之前的21人
<9-24,Sheldon>minus 21 men before the loss of virginity--

361
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,650
<9-24,Sheldon>即172人乘以0.18
<9-24,Sheldon>so 172 times 0.18 gives us...

362
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,380
<9-24,Sheldon>30.96位性伴侣
<9-24,Sheldon>30.96 sexual partners.

363
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,510
<9-24,Sheldon>约等于31
<9-24,Sheldon>Let's round that up to 31.

364
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,640
<9-25,Penny>好了  谢尔顿  这根本不对
<9-25,Penny>Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.

365
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,750
<9-25,Penny>跟实际数字大相径庭
<9-25,Penny>That is not even close to the real number.

366
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,710
<9-25,Penny>这里给我来杯酒
<9-25,Penny>I'm gonna need a drink over here.

367
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,890
<9-26,Amy>这真有趣
<9-26,Amy>This is very interesting.

368
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,490
<9-26,Amy>个人的文化认知是非常主观的
<9-26,Amy>Cultural perceptions are subjective.

369
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,200
<9-26,Amy>佩妮  在你看来  你是荡妇吗
<9-26,Amy>Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?

370
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,430
<9-27,Penny>不  不是
<9-27,Penny>No! No!

371
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,740
<9-27,Penny>不是
<9-27,Penny>No.

372
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,680
<9-27,Penny>我们还是自顾自用餐好了  好吗
<9-27,Penny>Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?

373
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,730
<9-28,Sheldon>确实是个有趣的话题
<9-28,Sheldon>This is an interesting topic.

374
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,290
<9-28,Sheldon>你有多少次性经验
<9-28,Sheldon>How many sexual encounters have you had?

375
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,420
<9-29,Amy>这要看志愿参加科学实验
<9-29,Amy>Does volunteering for a scientific experiment

376
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,330
<9-29,Amy>通过电子系统刺激人脑中的
<9-29,Amy>in which orgasm was achieved by electronically

377
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,960
<9-29,Amy>愉悦中心区获得性高潮也算吗
<9-29,Amy>stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain count?

378
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,160
<9-30,Sheldon>我想应该算的
<9-30,Sheldon>I should think so.

379
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,240
<9-31,Amy>那就是128次
<9-31,Amy>Then 128.

380
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,780
<10-1,Leonard>好的  进来吧
<10-1,Leonard>Okay, come on.

381
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,270
<10-1,Leonard>就快到了
<10-1,Leonard>Almost there.

382
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,760
<10-2,Howard>-别用力拉  -我没在拉
<10-2,Howard>- Don't tug. - No tugging.

383
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,940
<10-3,Raj>下回你自己搞定
<10-3,Raj>Next time, take your own advice.

384

<10-4,Leonard>打扰下  能否帮帮我们
<10-4,Leonard>Excuse me, could you help us out?

385
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,090
<10-5,Nurse>天哪天哪天哪
<10-5,Nurse>My, my, my.

386
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,240
<10-5,Nurse>这怎么回事
<10-5,Nurse>What do we have here?

387
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,020
<10-6,Howard>我不小心滑倒了
<10-6,Howard>I slipped and fell.

388
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,860
<10-7,Nurse>嗯  这我们经常碰到
<10-7,Nurse>Yeah, we get that a lot.

389
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,660
<10-7,Nurse>这是什么
<10-7,Nurse>What is this?

390
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,180
<10-8,Howard>是机器人的手臂
<10-8,Howard>It's a robot arm.

391
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,330
<10-9,Nurse>那机器人的其他部分呢
<10-9,Nurse>Where's the rest of the robot?

392
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,510
<10-10,Howard>我就造了手臂
<10-10,Howard>I only built the arm.

393
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,660
<10-11,Nurse>因为你就需要这个  是吗
<10-11,Nurse>'Cause that's all you needed, right?

394
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,470
<10-12,Howard>能先帮我解决这再说吗
<10-12,Howard>Can you please just help me?!

395
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,350
<10-12,Howard>好吧  好吧
<10-12,Howard>All right, all right.

396
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,200
<10-13,Nurse>稍安勿躁
<10-13,Nurse>Hang on, stay calm.

397
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,880
<10-13,Nurse>请派护理员送轮椅来
<10-13,Nurse>I need an orderly with a wheelchair.

398
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,710
<10-13,Nurse>有被机械手钳住小弟弟的来看急诊
<10-13,Nurse>I got a robot hand grasping a man's penis out here.

399
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,030
<10-14,Howard>你讲话就不能含蓄点
<10-14,Howard>You think you could be a little more discreet?

400
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,600
<10-15,Nurse>抱歉  "机械手钳住小弟弟"这种情况未设代码
<10-15,Nurse>I'm sorry,we don't have a code for "Robot hand grasping a man's penis."

401
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,860
<10-15,Nurse>它为何还连到电脑上
<10-15,Nurse>Why is it hooked up to a computer?

402
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,600
<10-16,Leonard>-就是通过电脑控制机械手的  -但电脑死机了
<10-16,Leonard>- Uh, it's what controls the arm. - But it's frozen.

403
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,070
<10-18,Nurse>你试过关机重启吗
<10-18,Nurse>Did you try turning it off and back on again?

404
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,050
<10-19,Howard>不  这事远比这复杂得多
<10-19,Howard>No, you see, it's more complicated than that.

405
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,380
<10-19,Howard>别  住手
<10-19,Howard>No, wait!

406
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,570
<10-19,Howard>小熊维尼终于从蜂蜜树中脱困
<10-19,Howard>Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.

407
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,210
<10-20,Raj>现在能让我们吃饼干和夏威夷宾治了吧
<10-20,Raj>Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?

408
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,500
<11-1,Sheldon>你说得对
<11-1,Sheldon>You were right.

409

<11-1,Sheldon>这个夜晚确实收获颇丰
<11-1,Sheldon>This was a very productive evening.

<11-1,Sheldon>今晚我见识到了艾米·菲拉·福勒全新的一面
<11-1,Sheldon>I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

411
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,970
<11-2,Penny>我没跟31个男人有过性关系
<11-2,Penny>I did not have sex with 31 guys.

412
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,840
<11-3,Sheldon>我很乐意验算下  但数字不会骗人的
<11-3,Sheldon>I'll be happy to check the math, but numbers don't lie, Penny.

413
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,720
<11-3,Sheldon>不管怎样  现在我和艾米已共度了"美好时光"
<11-3,Sheldon>In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together,

414
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,980
<11-3,Sheldon>我就更有信心
<11-3,Sheldon>I feel much more confident

415
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,830
<11-3,Sheldon>继续将我俩关系发展到下一阶段了
<11-3,Sheldon>proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.

416
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,970
<11-4,Penny>什么阶段
<11-4,Penny>And that is?

417
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,050
<11-5,Sheldon>利用试管授精和代孕
<11-5,Sheldon>Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus

418
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,860
<11-5,Sheldon>生下我们的后代向人类献礼
<11-5,Sheldon>to gift humanity with our progeny.

419
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,640
<11-6,Penny>你还在计划这个
<11-6,Penny>You're still on that?

420
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,370
<11-7,Sheldon>人世无常  人类难道不该有所安慰
<11-7,Sheldon>In these uncertain times, doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

421
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,830
<11-8,Penny>好吧  这样吧
<11-8,Penny>Okay, you know what?

422
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,340
<11-8,Penny>我再换种方式跟你说
<11-8,Penny>I'm gonna come at this in a whole new way.

423
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,220
<11-8,Penny>谢尔顿  如果你想用培养皿造出你跟艾米的孩子
<11-8,Penny>Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish,

424
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,310
<11-8,Penny>我一定会去告诉你的妈妈
<11-8,Penny>I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

425
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,550
<11-9,Sheldon>这威胁不了我
<11-9,Sheldon>That's no threat.

426
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,560
<11-9,Sheldon>我妈一直都想抱孙子的
<11-9,Sheldon>My mother's always wanted a grandchild.

427
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,750
<11-10,Penny>真的  你那虔信基督再生的母亲
<11-10,Penny>Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother

428
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,660
<11-10,Penny>会想要一个非婚生的试管婴儿当她的孙子
<11-10,Penny>wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?

429
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,830
<11-11,Sheldon>诅咒你
<11-11,Sheldon>Curses.

430
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,680
<11-12,Penny>我要是早点想出这招
<11-12,Penny>If I'd thought of that in the first place,

431
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,020
<11-12,Penny>今晚也不用受这份罪了
<11-12,Penny>I could've saved myself this whole night.

432
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,810
<11-13,Sheldon>现在还不算晚
<11-13,Sheldon>Well, it's not that late.

433
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,400
<11-13,Sheldon>你还是可以出去寻找32号性伴侣
<11-13,Sheldon>You could still go out and look for number 32.

434
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,020
<11-13,Sheldon>晚安
<11-13,Sheldon>Good night.

435
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,400
<11-14,Leonard (on phone)>霍华德  怎么了
<11-14,Leonard (on phone)>Hey, Howard, what's up?

436
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,040
<11-15,Sheldon>我决定不要孩子了
<11-15,Sheldon>I've decided not to procreate.

<11-16,Leonard>霍华德  慢点说
<11-16,Leonard>Howard, uh, slow down.

439
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,120
<11-16,Leonard>什么叫悲剧重演了
<11-16,Leonard>What do you mean it happened again?
