<1-1,Sheldon>Hey, would you like to hear some songs I've rewritten

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,810
<1-1,Sheldon>促进儿童对自然科学的产生兴趣的歌吗
<1-1,Sheldon>to get children interested in the hard sciences?

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,260
<1-2,Howard>-好啊  -你不是吧
<1-2,Howard>- Sure. - Really?

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,710
<1-3,Leonard>是啊  我喜欢音乐  也喜欢科学
<1-3,Leonard>Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science,

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,130
<1-4,Howard>我还喜欢嘲笑谢尔顿  开唱吧
<1-4,Howard>I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.

<1-6,Leonard>Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we-we get it.

18
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,190
<1-7,Sheldon>或许你会比较喜欢这首
<1-7,Sheldon>Perhaps you'd prefer this one.

24
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,180
<1-8,Leonard>谢谢
<1-8,Leonard>Thank you.

25
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,350
<1-9,Sheldon>你俩有谁认识碧昂丝[女歌手]吗
<1-9,Sheldon>Do either of you know Beyonce?

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,500
<1-9,Sheldon>我想让她也来支持这计划
<1-9,Sheldon>I'd love her to get behind it.

27
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,390
<1-13,Sheldon>你们知道宇航局最近在弄的
<1-13,Sheldon>You guys know the new Discovery class missions

28
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,190
<1-14,Raj>-发现计划吗  -知道啊
<1-14,Raj>- that NASA's been working on? - Yeah.

29
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,220
<1-14,Raj>宇航局投入成本由低到高分别是
<1-14,Raj>发现计划  新疆界计划  探索计划  旗舰计划

30
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,220
<1-16,Raj>他们想要在里面加入一段来自地球的讯息
<1-16,Raj>Well, they're looking to include a message from Earth

31
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,960
<1-16,Raj>以防哪天真碰见了外星生命
<1-16,Raj>in case one of them is encountered by alien life.

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,520
<1-17,Leonard>我遇见外星人的时候  我发现到
<1-17,Leonard>When I encountered alien life, I-I discovered

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,230
<1-17,Leonard>最重要的事情就是别抢了他的专座
<1-17,Leonard>that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,880
<1-18,Sheldon>你吸地球空气还得依赖呼吸器[哮喘]
<1-18,Sheldon>All right, you can't breathe our air without an inhaler,

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,260
<1-18,Sheldon>他对地球的坚果过敏
<1-18,Sheldon>he's allergic to Earth nuts,

36
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,460
<1-18,Sheldon>还好意思说我外星人呢
<1-18,Sheldon>but I'm the alien.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,760
<1-19,Raj>反正我和少数几位科学家
<1-19,Raj>Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,030
<1-19,Raj>被要求提交一份方案
<1-19,Raj>that have been asked to submit a design proposal

39
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,080
<1-19,Raj>设计讯息本身及其传达系统
<1-19,Raj>for the message and its delivery system.

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,600
<1-20,Sheldon>-太棒了  -恭喜啊
<1-20,Sheldon>- Excellent. - Congratulations.

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,340
<1-22,Leonard>所以我在想你们有谁
<1-22,Leonard>And I was wondering if any of you guys

42
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,860
<1-23,Raj>愿意来帮忙我呢
<1-23,Raj>would like to help me do it.

43
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,140
<1-24,Leonard>废话  当然愿意啦  你有什么构想了吗
<1-24,Leonard>Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?

44
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,130
<1-25,Sheldon>我来告诉你应该怎么做
<1-25,Sheldon>I'll tell you exactly what you should do:

45
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,360
<1-25,Sheldon>避免对地球人感知模式的先入为主
<1-25,Sheldon>avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,120
<1-26,Howard>完全正确
<1-26,Howard>Yeah, absolutely.

47
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,320
<1-26,Howard>你需要有个能用更多元化
<1-26,Howard>You need a device capable of delivering information

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,690
<1-26,Howard>感知传播形式来投放讯息的仪器
<1-26,Howard>across a wide range of perceptual modalities.

49
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,350
<1-27,Sheldon>任何智能生物最少都需要有
<1-27,Sheldon>Any intelligent organism would at the very least need

50
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,830
<1-27,Sheldon>知晓物体在空间中所在位置的能力
<1-27,Sheldon>the ability to locate the position of objects in space.

51
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,320
<1-27,Sheldon>所以最理想的星际沟通方式应该是触觉
<1-27,Sheldon>So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.

52
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,400
<1-28,Howard>改造一台三维触感传输器好让它能
<1-28,Howard>Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged

53
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,710
<1-28,Howard>多类型感知传输
<1-28,Howard>for cross-sensory transposition?

54
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,360
<1-29,Raj>跟我料想的一模一样
<1-29,Raj>Exactly what I expected.

55
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,870
<1-29,Raj>两个人把想法强灌到我脑里
<1-29,Raj>Two people forcing their ideas on me

56
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,770
<1-29,Raj>而只有一位绅士愿意问我
<1-29,Raj>and only one gentleman who could be bothered

57
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,520
<1-29,Raj>我有什么构想
<1-29,Raj>to ask me what my thoughts were.

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,380
<1-29,Raj>你们俩出局了  恭喜  莱纳德
<1-29,Raj>You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard,

59
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,390
<1-29,Raj>你入围了
<1-29,Raj>you're on the team.

60
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,390
<1-30,Leonard>我妈咪培养了个绅士
<1-30,Leonard>My mommy raised a gentleman.

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,500
<2-1,Raj>谢谢你过来
<2-1,Raj>Hey. Thanks for coming by.

68
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,880
<2-2,Leonard>我很乐意来帮忙啊
<2-2,Leonard>Yeah. I'm excited to help.

69
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,930
<2-3,Raj>我不是不愿意叫上另外两个
<2-3,Raj>I would have included the others, but...

70
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,660
<2-3,Raj>可你也知道他们来了会怎么样
<2-3,Raj>you know exactly what would've happened.

71
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,380
<2-3,Raj>他们会抢过这个计划  还对我们颐指气使
<2-3,Raj>They would've taken over the project and bossed us around.

72
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,340
<2-3,Raj>我懂
<2-3,Raj>I get it.

73
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,580
<2-4,Leonard>就今早吧
<2-4,Leonard>Uh, just this morning,

74
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,780
<2-4,Leonard>谢尔顿不允许我在早餐"浆果与坚果"里
<2-4,Leonard>Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts

75
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,110
<2-4,Leonard>知名美国早餐麦片品名
<2-4,Leonard>其实并不含任何浆果或坚果

76
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,310
<2-4,Leonard>加杏仁奶  他说理论这算坚果大战
<2-4,Leonard>because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.

77
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,820
<2-5,Raj>你应该叫他少多管闲事
<2-5,Raj>You should have told him to mind his own business.

78
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,370
<2-6,Leonard>是啊  这句话比我当时回答的那句好多了
<2-6,Leonard>Yeah. That's better than what I did say, which was,

79
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,160
<2-6,Leonard>我回了"好吧  我配气泡水吃吧"
<2-6,Leonard>"Fine, I'll eat them with club soda."

80
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,010
<2-7,Raj>他们凭啥觉得自己可以永远掌控一切啊
<2-7,Raj>What makes them think they're always in charge of everything?

81
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,680
<2-8,Leonard>他们是雄性帝王[α]人格嘛
<2-8,Leonard>Mmm, they're alpha males.

82
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,180
<2-9,Raj>那我们俩算啥
<2-9,Raj>What does that make us?

83
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,310
<2-10,Leonard>我们可以当宰相[β]  一人之下万人之上
<2-10,Leonard>We could be betas. They're second in charge.

84
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,330
<2-11,Raj>这样听起来还行
<2-11,Raj>Okay, that sounds good.

85
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,750
<2-12,Leonard>或者我们可以是死老百姓[Ω]
<2-12,Leonard>Or we could be omegas.

86
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,080
<2-12,Leonard>任帝王将相蹂躏玩弄
<2-12,Leonard>They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.

87
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,000
<2-13,Raj>听起来的确很像我们
<2-13,Raj>Okay, that sounds like us.

88
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,150
<2-14,Leonard>都无所谓了  这里没有帝王
<2-14,Leonard>Whatever. There's no alphas here,

89
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,520
<2-14,Leonard>而这是你的项目
<2-14,Leonard>and this is your project.

90
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,130
<2-14,Leonard>你来做主  你想怎么开始
<2-14,Leonard>You're in charge. How do you want to start?

91
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,260
<2-15,Raj>我不知道  你想怎么开始呢
<2-15,Raj>I don't know. How do you want to start?

92
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,880
<2-15,Raj>不知道啊
<2-15,Raj>I don't know.

93
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,750
<2-16,Leonard>我们应该打给谢尔顿跟霍华德吗
<2-16,Leonard>Should we call Sheldon and Howard?

94
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,800
<2-17,Raj>不用  我们可以自己搞定
<2-17,Raj>No. We can do this by ourselves.

95
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,370
<2-18,Leonard>好的  行  你想怎么开始
<2-18,Leonard>Okay. Great. How do you want to start?

96
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,400
<2-18,Leonard>我不知道  那你想怎么开始
<2-18,Leonard>I don't know. How do you want to start?

97
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,720
<3-1,Penny>谢尔顿
<3-1,Penny>Sheldon.

98
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,180
<3-1,Penny>谢尔顿
<3-1,Penny>Sheldon.

99
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,200
<3-1,Penny>谢尔顿
<3-1,Penny>Sheldon.

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,100
<3-2,Sheldon>我敢说你一开始是为了嘲笑我
<3-2,Sheldon>I bet that started off as a joke,

101
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,470
<3-2,Sheldon>但敲完第三下时  你发现
<3-2,Sheldon>but by the third one you realized

102
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,290
<3-2,Sheldon>有一股莫名的愉悦感涌上心头
<3-2,Sheldon>there was something strangely enjoyable about it.

103
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,950
<3-3,Penny>是啊  搞得人家都想再来一次了
<3-3,Penny>Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.

104
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,560
<3-4,Sheldon>我不建议这么做  你这辈子都会戒不掉
<3-4,Sheldon>I don't recommend it. You'll be doing it the rest of your life.

105
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,220
<3-4,Sheldon>如果你是来找莱纳德  他去库萨帕里家了
<3-4,Sheldon>Anyway, if you're looking for Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.

106
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,700
<3-5,Penny>不是  我其实是来找你谈谈
<3-5,Penny>Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.

107
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,550
<3-6,Sheldon>这么好啊
<3-6,Sheldon>How nice.

108
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,430
<3-6,Sheldon>给你提供几个我有兴趣的话题
<3-6,Sheldon>Here are some topics that interest me:

109
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,140
<3-6,Sheldon>量子力学  火车  旗帜
<3-6,Sheldon>quantum mechanics, trains, flags...

110
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,120
<3-7,Penny>不是不是  是来谈我的演艺事业
<3-7,Penny>No, no. It's about my acting career.

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,040
<3-8,Sheldon>抱歉
<3-8,Sheldon>Oh, sorry.

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
<3-8,Sheldon>这不在话题名单之上
<3-8,Sheldon>That's not on the list.

113
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,050
<3-9,Penny>等等  别这样
<3-9,Penny>Oh, wait. No.

114
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,200
<3-10,Sheldon>不如我们各退一步
<3-10,Sheldon>How about we split the difference

115
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,400
<3-10,Sheldon>改来聊聊为什么奥地利是大公国
<3-10,Sheldon>and discuss why Austria was an archduchy

116
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,760
<3-10,Sheldon>而不是普通公国
<3-10,Sheldon>and not just a regular duchy.

117
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,670
<3-11,Penny>听我说  事情是这样的
<3-11,Penny>Okay, look, here's the thing.

118
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,880
<3-11,Penny>我喜欢做医药销售  干得也不错
<3-11,Penny>I like pharmaceutical sales--it's going great--

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,270
<3-11,Penny>但我有一个电影的试镜
<3-11,Penny>but I have an audition for a movie,

120
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,470
<3-11,Penny>如果我得到那个角色  可能会失去现在的一切
<3-11,Penny>and if I get it, it could screw everything up.

121
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,610
<3-12,Sheldon>我完全知道你该怎么做
<3-12,Sheldon>I know exactly what you should do.

122
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,260
<3-12,Sheldon>很可惜  我不能告诉你
<3-12,Sheldon>Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.

123
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,620
<3-13,Penny>为什么
<3-13,Penny>Well, why?

124
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,390
<3-14,Sheldon>我在尝试改过自新
<3-14,Sheldon>I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf.

125
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,340
<3-14,Sheldon>今天早些时候  有人向我指出
<3-14,Sheldon>Earlier today, it was pointed out to me

126
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,690
<3-14,Sheldon>我常常将自己的想法强加于人
<3-14,Sheldon>that I tend to force my ideas on people.

127
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,990
<3-15,Penny>你真的不打算告诉我吗
<3-15,Penny>You're really not gonna tell me?

128
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,310
<3-16,Sheldon>不  时机已过火车已离站
<3-16,Sheldon>No, that train has left the station.

129
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,960
<3-16,Sheldon>现在我们有两种玩法
<3-16,Sheldon>Now, we can play this one of two ways.

130
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,680
<3-16,Sheldon>你可以说"火车  再说说"
<3-16,Sheldon>You can say, "Trains, tell me more,"

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,880
<3-16,Sheldon>或...
<3-16,Sheldon>or...

132
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,570
<3-16,Sheldon>你也可以那样看着我
<3-16,Sheldon>you can just look at me like that

133
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,880
<3-16,Sheldon>我就会开始说
<3-16,Sheldon>and I'll start.

134
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,320
<4-1,Bernadette>你在里面鼓捣啥呢
<4-1,Bernadette>What's going on in here?

135
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,600
<4-2,Howard>我在做分子鸡尾酒
<4-2,Howard>I am making molecular cocktails.

136
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,260
<4-2,Howard>这个小球其实就是大都会鸡尾酒
<4-2,Howard>This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.

137
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,170
<4-3,Bernadette>那要怎么喝呢
<4-3,Bernadette>How do you drink it?

138
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,330
<4-4,Howard>直接放进嘴里  然后像挤青春痘那样挤爆它
<4-4,Howard>Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.

139
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,650
<4-5,Bernadette>我还是喝啤酒吧
<4-5,Bernadette>I think I'll have a beer.

140
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,920
<4-6,Howard>先跟我一起拍张照
<4-6,Howard>First take a picture with me.

141
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,580
<4-7,Bernadette>为什么
<4-7,Bernadette>Why?

142
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,940
<4-8,Howard>我和拉杰一直在说要
<4-8,Howard>Well, Raj and I always talked about learning

143
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,370
<4-8,Howard>一起学做这样的鸡尾酒
<4-8,Howard>how to make cocktails like this together,

144
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,190
<4-8,Howard>现在我学会了  我要把照片放分享网站上
<4-8,Howard>so I taught myself and I'm putting this on Instagram

145
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,270
<4-8,Howard>好让他看见  觉得自己很屎
<4-8,Howard>so he can see it and feel like a turd.

146
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,370
<4-8,Howard>笑一个
<4-8,Howard>Say cheese.

147
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,130
<4-9,Bernadette>是因为航天探测器的项目他没让你参与吗
<4-9,Bernadette>Is this about the space probe he's working on without you?

148
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,290
<4-10,Howard>那还用说  肯定是啊
<4-10,Howard>You betcha. The very one.

149
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,000
<4-11,Bernadette>霍华德  你是成年人了
<4-11,Bernadette>Howard, you're grown men.

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,100
<4-11,Bernadette>你们几个用不着干什么事都在一起
<4-11,Bernadette>You guys don't have to do everything together.

151
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,130
<4-12,Howard>我知道  所以我今晚跟你待着啊
<4-12,Howard>I know. That's why I'm spending tonight with you.

152
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,330
<4-13,Bernadette>你是想让拉杰难过
<4-13,Bernadette>Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.

153
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,160
<4-14,Howard>跟我的宝贝一起惩罚他
<4-14,Howard>With my honeybunch.

154
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,010
<4-15,Bernadette>你真幼稚
<4-15,Bernadette>You're being childish.

155
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,840
<4-16,Howard>不  他才是
<4-16,Howard>No. He is.

156
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,790
<4-16,Howard>没错  我是有支配性人格
<4-16,Howard>So I have a dominant personality.

157
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,540
<4-16,Howard>我们大家都知道
<4-16,Howard>We all know that.

158
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,220
<4-17,Bernadette>抱歉  我们都知道什么
<4-17,Bernadette>I'm sorry. What do we know?

159
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
<4-18,Howard>在社交团体中
<4-18,Howard>In social groupings,

160
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,830
<4-18,Howard>话事权总是自然而然落在我手里
<4-18,Howard>I just naturally wind up in charge.

161
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,970
<4-19,Bernadette>你别误会  我不是要质疑你
<4-19,Bernadette>Don't take this the wrong way,

162
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,280
<4-19,Bernadette>但你是吃了多少颗这种小酒球啊
<4-19,Bernadette>but how many of these little booze balls have you had?

163
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,370
<4-20,Howard>你认为我不是领导吗
<4-20,Howard>You don't think I'm a leader?

164
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,260
<4-21,Bernadette>我开玩笑啦  你当然是啊
<4-21,Bernadette>I was kidding. Of course you are.

165
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,880
<4-22,Howard>对啊  我想改也改不过来
<4-22,Howard>Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to.

166
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,130
<4-23,Bernadette>你最好不要改  因为我喜欢这样的你
<4-23,Bernadette>You better not change, because I love who you are.

167
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,470
<4-23,Bernadette>你鼓捣完后  需要我帮忙清理吗
<4-23,Bernadette>Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you're done

168
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,450
<4-23,Bernadette>或是你一个人全包了
<4-23,Bernadette>or can you do it all by yourself?

169
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,850
<4-24,Howard>我全包了
<4-24,Howard>All by myself.

170
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,920
<4-25,Bernadette>这才是我的大领导嘛
<4-25,Bernadette>There's my big boss man.

171
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,130
<5-1,Sheldon>通常在火车头前面
<5-1,Sheldon>So, often on the front of the locomotive

172
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,860
<5-1,Sheldon>有一个大铁楔
<5-1,Sheldon>is a large iron wedge

173
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,190
<5-1,Sheldon>用来清理铁轨上的东西
<5-1,Sheldon>for clearing objects off the tracks.

174
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,080
<5-1,Sheldon>通常俗称"排障器"[抓牛器]
<5-1,Sheldon>Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher,

175
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,080
<5-1,Sheldon>最早在火车头装这个
<5-1,Sheldon>是为了把铁轨上散步的牛或障碍赶走

176
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,790
<5-1,Sheldon>我喜欢更确切的叫法"爆牛器"
<5-1,Sheldon>I prefer the more accurate "Cow exploder."

178
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,440
<5-2,Penny>好吧  谢尔顿  我问你个问题
<5-2,Penny>Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.

179
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,370
<5-4,Penny>如果我在火车站
<5-4,Penny>If I was at a train station

180
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,190
<5-4,Penny>有一辆火车可以载我去我现在的工作
<5-4,Penny>and one train could take me to my current job

181
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,990
<5-4,Penny>另一辆可以载我去一部电影的试镜
<5-4,Penny>and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie,

182
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,550
<5-4,Penny>那我应该上哪辆火车呢
<5-4,Penny>which train should I get on?

183
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,850
<5-5,Sheldon>你是在利用火车来骗我给你建议吗
<5-5,Sheldon>Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?

184
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
<5-6,Penny>不是
<5-6,Penny>No.

185
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,350
<5-6,Penny>那就可以说
<5-6,Penny>All right, then.

186
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,650
<5-7,Sheldon>你应该上第三辆火车
<5-7,Sheldon>You should take a third train

187
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,740
<5-7,Sheldon>去参加电影试镜
<5-7,Sheldon>where you audition for the movie

188
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,850
<5-7,Sheldon>但先别着急做职业上的抉择
<5-7,Sheldon>but hold off on making a career decision

189
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,980
<5-7,Sheldon>等了解更多情况再说
<5-7,Sheldon>until you have more information.

190
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,410
<5-7,Sheldon>你说得有道理
<5-7,Sheldon>You're right.

191
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,320
<5-8,Penny>我在担心一件根本还没发生的事
<5-8,Penny>I'm worried about something that hasn't even happened yet.

192
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,650
<5-8,Penny>你真是位智者
<5-8,Penny>You are a wise man.

193
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,300
<5-9,Sheldon>佩妮  谁更聪明  是智者
<5-9,Sheldon>Well, Penny, who's smarter: the wise man

194
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,150
<5-9,Sheldon>还是向智者寻求建议的那个人
<5-9,Sheldon>or the person who comes to him for advice?

195
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,840
<5-10,Penny>我猜你说得对
<5-10,Penny>Oh, I guess you're right.

196
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,630
<5-10,Penny>或许还真是懂得寻求建议的人
<5-10,Penny>Maybe it is the person who asks.

197
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,280
<5-11,Sheldon>错  是智者
<5-11,Sheldon>No, it's the wise man.

198
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,460
<5-11,Sheldon>不然他干嘛叫智者
<5-11,Sheldon>That's why he's called the wise man.

199
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,570
<5-11,Sheldon>你知道我怎么知道的吗
<5-11,Sheldon>You know how I know that?

200
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,420
<5-11,Sheldon>我就是智者
<5-11,Sheldon>I'm the wise man.

201
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,110
<5-12,Penny>抱歉  我刚才在想什么啊
<5-12,Penny>I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

202
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,030
<5-13,Sheldon>出于好奇问一句
<5-13,Sheldon>Uh, just out of curiosity,

203
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,620
<5-13,Sheldon>这件事你干嘛不问莱纳德意见呢
<5-13,Sheldon>why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this?

204
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,180
<5-14,Penny>因为我早就知道他会说什么
<5-14,Penny>'Cause I already know what he'll say.

205
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,920
<5-14,Penny>"这个那个  总之你不该去"
<5-14,Penny>"Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it."

206
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,100
<5-15,Sheldon>跟他本人在这似的
<5-15,Sheldon>It's just like he's here!

207
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,300
<6-1,Raj>人类之前已经尝试过将讯息投放到太空中
<6-1,Raj>Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space,

208
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,040
<6-1,Raj>就像旅行者上的金唱片
<6-1,Raj>like the Golden Record on Voyager,

209
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,180
<6-1,Raj>骂声一片
<6-1,Raj>were heavily criticized.

210
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,200
<6-2,Leonard>外星人只有做一台唱机出来
<6-2,Leonard>Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record

211
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,350
<6-2,Leonard>才能播放金唱片
<6-2,Leonard>if they figured out how to build a record player.

212
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,640
<6-3,Raj>不过公平地说  我看着ET用一台学习玩具
<6-3,Raj>Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone

213
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,640
<6-3,Raj>和一把伞  做了一台电话机
<6-3,Raj>out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella.

214
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,150
<6-3,Raj>那小家伙就像棕色皮肤的马盖先
<6-3,Raj>Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.

215
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,150
<6-3,Raj>美国90年代连续剧中的男主角
<6-3,Raj>擅长用普通生活用品作为工具

216
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,170
<6-4,Leonard>如果E.T.真实存在  会大有帮助
<6-4,Leonard>That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.

217
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,720
<6-5,Raj>电影里它快死的时候  我的感情是真实的
<6-5,Raj>Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.

218
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,350
<6-6,Leonard>天啊  还有它躺在台子上  他们电击它
<6-6,Leonard>My God, when he's on the table and they use the paddles on him.

219
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,650
<6-7,Raj>它全身都变白了
<6-7,Raj>And he's all white.

220
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,770
<6-8,Leonard>他们把他放进袋子  拉上拉链
<6-8,Leonard>They zip him up in that bag.

221
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,000
<6-9,Raj>格蒂一直在哭
<6-9,Raj>And Gertie can't stop crying.

222
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,590
<6-10,Leonard>花都枯萎了
<6-10,Leonard>The flower dies.

223
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,960
<6-11,Raj>-够了  我们换个话题吧  -好的
<6-11,Raj>- Okay, let's talk about something else.- All right.

224
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,390
<6-12,Leonard>听起来我们需要一种简单的沟通方式
<6-12,Leonard>So it-it sounds like we need a way to communicate that's simple.

225
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,370
<6-13,Raj>而且不需要外部机器
<6-13,Raj>And doesn't require outside machinery

226
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,510
<6-13,Raj>就可以直接读取
<6-13,Raj>to be built to access it.

227
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,560
<6-14,Leonard>这也是一个问题  因为我们根本不知道
<6-14,Leonard>It's also a problem because we don't even know

228
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,580
<6-14,Leonard>找到这个东西的外星人是否有视觉
<6-14,Leonard>if the aliens who find this can see.

229
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,640
<6-14,Leonard>他们可能会用
<6-14,Leonard>I mean, they might communicate

230
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,550
<6-14,Leonard>和我们完全不同的方式进行交流
<6-14,Leonard>in a totally different way than us.

231
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,320
<6-15,Raj>就像我的小狗生我气时
<6-15,Raj>Like when my dog is mad at me,

232
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,030
<6-15,Raj>她的表达方式是尿我拖鞋上
<6-15,Raj>she tells me by peeing in my slippers.

233
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,600
<6-16,Leonard>这还真是一个很好的例子
<6-16,Leonard>That's actually a valid example.

234
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,410
<6-16,Leonard>动物就会用气味来传达信息
<6-16,Leonard>Animals do deliver messages through scent.

235
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,320
<6-17,Raj>蜜蜂通过舞蹈来互相交流
<6-17,Raj>Bees talk to each other by dancing.

236
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,490
<6-17,Raj>鲸鱼有自己的鲸鱼歌
<6-17,Raj>Whales have their songs.

237
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,950
<6-18,Leonard>佩妮有20种翻白眼的方式
<6-18,Leonard>Penny has about 20 different ways of rolling her eyes

238
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,890
<6-18,Leonard>每种白眼都代表不同的意思
<6-18,Leonard>that each mean something different.

239
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,570
<6-19,Raj>好了  总结起来就是
<6-19,Raj>Okay, so, what it sounds like is,

240
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,860
<6-19,Raj>我们需要的是
<6-19,Raj>what we want is a device

241
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,830
<6-19,Raj>一种不光是用视觉  还能透过其他感知方式
<6-19,Raj>that can deliver a message through not only sight,

242
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,380
<6-19,Raj>传递讯息的装置
<6-19,Raj>but other senses, as well.

243
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,940
<6-20,Leonard>任何宇宙文明都应该具备的
<6-20,Leonard>The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization

244
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,380
<6-20,Leonard>最基本的感知就是触觉了
<6-20,Leonard>would have to possess is touch.

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,050
<6-21,Raj>我们应该设计一个可以播放视频
<6-21,Raj>We could make a video-playing device

246
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,560
<6-21,Raj>同时能把讯息转化到
<6-21,Raj>that simultaneously translates the information

247
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,850
<6-21,Raj>可触摸媒介上的装置
<6-21,Raj>into a tactile medium.

248
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,530
<6-22,Leonard>我们只需要装配一台三维交流系统装置就行了
<6-22,Leonard>All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system!

249
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,820
<6-23,Raj>我们完全可以办到
<6-23,Raj>We-we can totally do that!

250
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,500
<6-24,Leonard>我知道
<6-24,Leonard>I know!

251
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,150
<6-25,Raj>实在太棒了
<6-25,Raj>This is great!

252
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,250
<6-26,Leonard>-还有件事你知道吗  -什么
<6-26,Leonard>- Yeah, you know what else it is? - What?

253
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,920
<6-28,Howard>这和谢尔顿  霍华德之前说的完全一样
<6-28,Howard>Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.

254
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,930
<6-29,Raj>多谢你在我拖鞋里撒的这泡尿
<6-29,Raj>Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.

255
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,580
<7-1,Sheldon (singing)>* 这是猛虎的眼睛 *
<7-1,Sheldon (singing)>* It's the eye of the tiger *

257
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,300
<7-1,Sheldon (singing)>* 这是蝙蝠的耳朵 *
<7-1,Sheldon (singing)>* It's the ear of the bat *

258
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,640
<7-1,Sheldon (singing)>* 这是鲶鱼的胡须 *
<7-1,Sheldon (singing)>* It's the whiskers of the catfish *

259
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,420
<7-1,Sheldon (singing)>* 和海象的... *
<7-1,Sheldon (singing)>* And the walrus... *

260
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,730
<7-2,Howard>等等  不是说你的歌烂  它的确很烂
<7-2,Howard>Hang on. Not that your song isn't terrible-- it is...

261
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,060
<7-2,Howard>但是你提到蝙蝠  怎么能忘掉声纳呢
<7-2,Howard>...but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?

262
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,760
<7-3,Sheldon>人家还没唱完呢
<7-3,Sheldon>You didn't let me finish.

263
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,980
<7-3,Sheldon>* 既然提到了蝙蝠*
<7-3,Sheldon>* And also regarding the bat *

264
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,660
<7-3,Sheldon>* 它还有声纳 *
<7-3,Sheldon>* It has sonar. *

265
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,040
<7-4,Leonard>好啊
<7-4,Leonard>Hello.

266
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,100
<7-5,Howard>我说
<7-5,Howard>Look,

267
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,070
<7-6,Raj>我知道你们俩不高兴  但我们讨论过了
<7-6,Raj>I know you guys are upset, but we've talked about it,

268
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,590
<7-6,Raj>我们认为你们的加入
<7-6,Raj>and we think it'd be beneficial

269
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,590
<7-6,Raj>对这个项目很有好处
<7-6,Raj>for you to be part of the project.

270
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,970
<7-7,Howard>哎哟哟  你听到了吗  谢尔顿
<7-7,Howard>Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?

271
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,030
<7-8,Sheldon>抱歉  我刚才很专心在想
<7-8,Sheldon>I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes

272
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,100
<7-8,Sheldon>"食蚁兽的鼻子"和什么词押韵
<7-8,Sheldon>with "Nose of the aardvark."

273
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,900
<7-9,Leonard>我们希望你俩加入这个项目
<7-9,Leonard>We want you back on the project with us.

274
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,790
<7-10,Sheldon>哎哟哟  你听到了吗  霍华德
<7-10,Sheldon>Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?

275
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,490
<7-11,Raj>我们承认
<7-11,Raj>Look, we admit it.

276
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,190
<7-11,Raj>你俩的点子非常不错
<7-11,Raj>The idea that you guys came up with was really good,

277
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,350
<7-11,Raj>我也很希望得到你们的帮助
<7-11,Raj>and I'd love your help.

278
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,930
<7-12,Howard>我想要你说出这些话对也不容易吧
<7-12,Howard>I suppose it couldn't have been easy for you to say that.

279
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,180
<7-13,Raj>是不容易  所以你们愿意吗
<7-13,Raj>It wasn't, so... are you in?

280
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,790
<7-14,Sheldon>-愿意  -当然
<7-14,Sheldon>- Certainly. - Sure.

281
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,690
<7-15,Howard>太好了
<7-15,Howard>Great.

282
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,290
<7-16,Leonard>既然大家意见都一致了
<7-16,Leonard>Now that we're all on the same page,

283
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,120
<7-16,Leonard>今晚我们就一起开始工作吧
<7-16,Leonard>let's get together tonight and work on it.

284
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,330
<7-16,Leonard>"今晚一起来"
<7-16,Leonard>"Get together tonight"?

285
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,420
<7-17,Sheldon>莱纳德  不要老是想掌控全局
<7-17,Sheldon>Leonard, stop trying to control everything,

286
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,900
<7-17,Sheldon>让可怜的拉杰也有机会做个决定好吗
<7-17,Sheldon>and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do.

287
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,960
<7-17,Sheldon>说吧  拉杰
<7-17,Sheldon>Go ahead, Raj.

288
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,650
<7-18,Raj>我觉得我们现在就开始吧
<7-18,Raj>Okay, I think we should do it right now.

289
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,100
<7-19,Sheldon>-我今晚比较方便  -好吧
<7-19,Sheldon>- Tonight works better for me. - Okay.

290
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,690
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>好了  只是个试镜而已
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>Okay, it's just an audition.

291
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,270
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>我干嘛要紧张呢
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>Why am I nervous?

292
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,650
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>也许这是一件好事
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>Maybe it's a good thing.

293
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,380
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>紧张代表我很渴望这角色
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>Just means I want it.

294
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,580
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>我一定能得到这个角色的
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>And I can have it.

295
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,680
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>这种感觉倍儿爽
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>This feels right.

296
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,450
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>我当初干嘛要放弃演艺事业呢
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>Why did I ever give this up?

297
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,260
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>往事一幕一幕涌上心头
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>I'm starting to remember.

298
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,700
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>我想尝试一种新的方式
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>So, I'd like to try a technique

299
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,160
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>让大家享受平等的待遇
<8-1,Penny (voiceover)>where no one gets steamrolled.

300
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,330
<9-1,Raj>你们说话时
<9-1,Raj>When you talk,

301
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,090
<9-1,Raj>不要一开口就提出新点子
<9-1,Raj>instead of bringing up a new idea,

302
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,410
<9-1,Raj>要尊重别人之前的发言  加上"如你所说"
<9-1,Raj>respect what was just said by building on it.

303
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,850
<9-2,Sheldon>如你所说
<9-2,Sheldon>Uh, building on that...

304
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,210
<9-2,Sheldon>我们应该叫个外卖
<9-2,Sheldon>...we should order dinner.

305
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,210
<9-3,Leonard>你这话哪一点算是如他所说呀
<9-3,Leonard>How is that building on what he just said?

306
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,310
<9-4,Howard>如谢尔顿所说  我想吃中餐
<9-4,Howard>Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.

307
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,980
<9-5,Raj>等等  如莱纳德所说
<9-5,Raj>Hang on. Building on what Leonard said,

308
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,440
<9-5,Raj>完全没人是接我所说的啊
<9-5,Raj>no one built on what I said.

309
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,160
<9-6,Sheldon>如你所说的"如你所说"
<9-6,Sheldon>Building on "building on that,"

310
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,100
<9-6,Sheldon>科罗拉多有家新开的自选披萨店
<9-6,Sheldon>there's a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.

311
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,150
<9-7,Leonard>如你所说  我想提醒你
<9-7,Leonard>Building on that, I'd like to remind you,

312
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,310
<9-7,Leonard>我有乳糖不耐症
<9-7,Leonard>I'm lactose intolerant.

313
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,840
<9-8,Howard>我看过菜单了  里面有豆酪可选
<9-8,Howard>I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.

314
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,510
<9-9,Sheldon>你没有说"如你所说"  你输了
<9-9,Sheldon>You didn't say "building on." You're out!

315
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,720
<9-10,Leonard>这又不是"我说你做"游戏
<9-10,Leonard>It's not Simon Says.

316
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,830
<9-11,Raj>你的重点错了  谢尔顿
<9-11,Raj>Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.

317
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,760
<9-12,Sheldon>你输了  你也输了
<9-12,Sheldon>You're out, and you're out.

318
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,910
<9-12,Sheldon>我赢了  谁想吃披萨
<9-12,Sheldon>I win! Who wants pizza?

319
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,270
<10-1,Girl>佩妮
<10-1,Girl>Penny?

320
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,550
<10-3,Girl>好久没看到你来试镜了
<10-3,Girl>I haven't seen you auditioning in a while.

321
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,300
<10-4,Penny>我找了份医药销售代表的工作
<10-4,Penny>Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.

322
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,430
<10-5,Girl>你不演戏了吗
<10-5,Girl>You quit acting?

323
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,440
<10-6,Penny>算是吧
<10-6,Penny>Well, kind of.

324
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,470
<10-6,Penny>不过现在我需要演
<10-6,Penny>But now I get to act like

325
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,070
<10-6,Penny>心脏发炎只是无关痛痒的副作用而已
<10-6,Penny>inflamed heart is only a "Mild side effect."

326
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,030
<10-7,Second Girl>我听说干这一行可以赚不少钱呢
<10-7,Second Girl>I heard you can make good money doing that.

327
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,440
<10-8,Penny>是啊  待遇还不错  但我有时会怀念演戏
<10-8,Penny>Yeah, it's going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.

328
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,570
<10-10,Penny>真的吗
<10-10,Penny>Really?

329
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,780
<10-11,First Girl>我告诉你  我可是烦透了这种倍受屈辱
<10-11,First Girl>'Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation

330
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,810
<10-11,First Girl>被人当块肉般对待的生活
<10-11,First Girl>and being treated like a piece of meat.

331
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,750
<10-12,Audiitoner>切尔西
<10-12,Audiitoner>Chelsea?

332
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,740
<10-13,First Girl>祝我好运吧
<10-13,First Girl>Wish me luck.

333
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,760
<10-14,Second Girl>他们一定会喜欢你
<10-14,Second Girl>They're gonna love you.

334
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,840
<10-14,Second Girl>我听说她都快40岁了  全身都修整过
<10-14,Second Girl>I heard she's pushing 40 and everything's fake.

335
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,840
<10-15,Penny>这谣言是我传出去的
<10-15,Penny>Yeah. I started that rumor.

336
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,620
<11-1,Leonard>我们已经讨论出了投放讯息的设备
<11-1,Leonard>Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message,

337
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,180
<11-1,Leonard>现在可以讨论要投放什么讯息了
<11-1,Leonard>maybe we should talk about what the message could be.

338
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,800
<11-2,Raj>我认为要能显示出地球人的模样
<11-2,Raj>Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.

339
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,610
<11-3,Howard>他们在先驱者号探测器上装的是
<11-3,Howard>The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe

340
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,650
<11-3,Howard>一对裸男女的画像
<11-3,Howard>had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.

341
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,380
<11-4,Sheldon>我对那种不感冒
<11-4,Sheldon>Yeah, I never cared for that.

342
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,900
<11-4,Sheldon>简直是在告诉掠夺种族
<11-4,Sheldon>It's advertising to predator races

343
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,830
<11-4,Sheldon>我们是有多软弱多好蹂躏
<11-4,Sheldon>just how soft and squishy we are.

344
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,210
<11-5,Leonard>蹂躏你自己去
<11-5,Leonard>Squeeze yourself!

345
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,040
<11-6,Sheldon>听了别不高兴
<11-6,Sheldon>Oh, don't be offended.

346
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,350
<11-6,Sheldon>你明知道我们四人当中
<11-6,Sheldon>You know, of the four of us,

347
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,530
<11-6,Sheldon>你最有小鲜肉的质感了
<11-6,Sheldon>you have the most veal-like consistency.

348
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,710
<11-7,Raj>或许有方法可以表明我们没有侵略的意愿
<11-7,Raj>Well, maybe there's a way to appear nonaggressive,

349
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,330
<11-7,Raj>但还是有保护我们自己的能力
<11-7,Raj>but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary.

350
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,770
<11-7,Raj>比如微笑着一手挥手
<11-7,Raj>Like smiling and waving with one hand,

351
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,280
<11-7,Raj>另一只手里拎个砍下来的虎头
<11-7,Raj>but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.

352
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,560
<11-8,Howard>你想投放一条放冷箭的讯息
<11-8,Howard>You want to send a passive-aggressive message

353
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,630
<11-8,Howard>到太空里吗
<11-8,Howard>out into the universe?

354
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,660
<11-8,Howard>太可笑了
<11-8,Howard>That's ridiculous.

355
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,320
<11-9,Raj>你说的放冷箭是指
<11-9,Raj>Oh, you mean passive-aggressive

356
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,790
<11-9,Raj>发张你和你老婆吃着本属于我的
<11-9,Raj>like posting pictures of you and your wife

357
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,740
<11-9,Raj>大都会鸡尾酒球的那种行为吗
<11-9,Raj>eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?

358
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,980
<11-10,Sheldon>也许霍华德说的放冷箭是指
<11-10,Sheldon>Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive

359
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,530
<11-10,Sheldon>一开始请我们大家来帮忙你的项目
<11-10,Sheldon>like asking our group to help on your project,

360
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,860
<11-10,Sheldon>可是最终只选了莱纳德一个人
<11-10,Sheldon>and then only choosing Leonard.

361
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,350
<11-11,Raj>抱歉伤你们感情了
<11-11,Raj>Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,

362
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,580
<11-11,Raj>可你们俩都太强势
<11-11,Raj>but you do have strong personalities

363
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,420
<11-11,Raj>话事权总是会被你们抢过去
<11-11,Raj>and always end up taking over.

364
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,950
<11-12,Howard>也没有总是啊
<11-12,Howard>It's not always.

365
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,620
<11-13,Leonard>那次去漫展
<11-13,Leonard>What about when we went to Comic-Con

366
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,240
<11-13,Leonard>我们办成赫特人贾巴
<11-13,Leonard>and dressed like Jabba the Hutt?

367
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,670
<11-13,Leonard>《星球大战》角色
<11-13,Leonard>基本就是一条大型脑满肠肥样鼻涕虫

368
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,670
<11-13,Leonard>你扮贾巴的脑袋
<11-13,Leonard>You got to be Jabba's head,

369
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,890
<11-13,Leonard>我只能扮死肥鼻涕虫下半身
<11-13,Leonard>and I got to be his fat slug butt.

370
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,130
<11-14,Sheldon>我们看起来超赞
<11-14,Sheldon>We looked great.

371
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,500
<11-15,Leonard>你还让个男人坐我身上
<11-15,Leonard>You let a guy sit on me.

372
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,430
<11-16,Howard>他扮的是莱亚公主
<11-16,Howard>He was dressed as Princess Leia.

373
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,000
<11-16,Howard>合照效果特好
<11-16,Howard>It made a nice picture.

374
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,340
<11-17,Leonard>我只是说拉杰和我有时候感觉被排挤了
<11-17,Leonard>I'm just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.

375
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,690
<11-18,Raj>比如你带谢尔顿去了德克萨斯
<11-18,Raj>Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas

376
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,440
<11-18,Raj>带他参观了宇航局
<11-18,Raj>and showed him all around NASA--

377
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,480
<11-18,Raj>都没想到请莱纳德和我去啊
<11-18,Raj>you didn't even think to ask me and Leonard.

378
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,320
<11-19,Howard>你们说得对
<11-19,Howard>You know what? You're right.

379
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,280
<11-19,Howard>我应该邀请你们的
<11-19,Howard>I should have asked you.

380
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,480
<11-20,Sheldon>如果他邀请了  立马答应
<11-20,Sheldon>Yeah, and if he does ask you, go.

381
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,220
<11-20,Sheldon>老炫酷了
<11-20,Sheldon>It's amazing.

382
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,050
<11-21,Howard>如果要说被排挤
<11-21,Howard>Okay, and if we're talking about being left out of things,

383
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,310
<11-21,Howard>你们去了天行者牧场也没带我们啊
<11-21,Howard>you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.

384
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,770
<11-22,Sheldon>那地方我也诚意推荐
<11-22,Sheldon>Oh, I recommend that, too.

385
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,210
<11-22,Sheldon>简直是梦幻之旅啊
<11-22,Sheldon>That was a magical experience!

386
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,390
<11-23,Leonard>等等
<11-23,Leonard>Wait a minute.

388
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,860
<11-23,Leonard>谢尔顿跟詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯待了一天
<11-23,Leonard>Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones

389
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,300
<11-23,Leonard>都没告诉我们
<11-23,Leonard>and never told any of us.

390
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,710
<11-24,Sheldon>还真是
<11-24,Sheldon>I sure did.

391
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,450
<11-24,Sheldon>天了噜
<11-24,Sheldon>Oh, my goodness!

392
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,650
<11-24,Sheldon>从贾巴脑袋到跟黑武士吃雪糕
<11-24,Sheldon>Well, from Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader,

393
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,970
<11-24,Sheldon>我这一路走来精彩纷呈啊
<11-24,Sheldon>I'm having a heck of a ride.

394
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,900
<11-24,Sheldon>你看
<11-24,Sheldon>Yeah, look,

395
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,160
<11-24,Sheldon>明显由我说了算的时候都有好事发生
<11-24,Sheldon>clearly, good things happen when I'm in charge.

396
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,230
<11-24,Sheldon>孩子们现在何不退下
<11-24,Sheldon>Now, why don't you boys step aside,

397
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,090
<11-24,Sheldon>让朕将此项目一举击破
<11-24,Sheldon>let me knock this project out?

398
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,660
<11-25,Leonard>谢尔顿  不是你做主
<11-25,Leonard>Sheldon, you're not in charge.

399
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,970
<11-25,Leonard>拉杰做主
<11-25,Leonard>Raj is in charge.

400
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,520
<11-26,Sheldon>莱纳德  究竟谁做主
<11-26,Sheldon>Leonard, who's really in charge?

401
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,400
<11-26,Sheldon>是做主的人  还是任命谁做主的人
<11-26,Sheldon>The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?

402
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,660
<11-26,Sheldon>他说得对
<11-26,Sheldon>He's right.

403
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,850
<11-27,Raj>你想想  其实我们都能做主
<11-27,Raj>If you think about it, we're all in charge.

404
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,340
<11-28,Sheldon>不  做主的人才是主...
<11-28,Sheldon>No, the guy in charge is in...

405
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,980
<11-28,Sheldon>怎么每个人都不懂这种问题呢
<11-28,Sheldon>Why is everyone so bad at these?!

406
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,130
<12-1,Penny>整段经历都让我记起
<12-1,Penny>I mean, the whole experience reminded me

407
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,920
<12-1,Penny>为什么我会恨那个世界
<12-1,Penny>about how much I hated about that world.

408
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,530
<12-1,Penny>那种焦虑压抑  负能量爆棚
<12-1,Penny>You-you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity.

409
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,970
<12-1,Penny>我不想有那种感觉
<12-1,Penny>I don't want to feel those things.

410
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,690
<12-1,Penny>我想把药卖给有那种感觉的人
<12-1,Penny>I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.

411
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,540
<12-2,Amy>难以置信你居然这么干脆地
<12-2,Amy>I can't believe you got up and walked out

412
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,630
<12-2,Amy>放弃大电影的试镜
<12-2,Amy>of an audition for a big movie.

413
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,830
<12-2,Amy>是啊
<12-2,Amy>I did.

414
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,720
<12-3,Penny>我进去了  念了段台词
<12-3,Penny>I-I mean, I walked in, read for the part,

415
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,620
<12-3,Penny>然后卡壳了  就马上走人了
<12-3,Penny>then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.

416
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,270
<12-4,Bernadette>很高兴能看到你对工作有了新的认识
<12-4,Bernadette>Well, I'm glad you have a new appreciation for your job.

417
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,510
<12-5,Penny>确实有新感悟
<12-5,Penny>I do, and you know, I don't think

418
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,530
<12-5,Penny>我还没好好谢过你帮我找到这份工作
<12-5,Penny>I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.

419
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,070
<12-6,Bernadette>好好谢还是压根没谢过
<12-6,Bernadette>Properly, at all.

420
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,820
<12-6,Bernadette>都是我从未听过的言语
<12-6,Bernadette>It's just words I've never heard.

421
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,010
<12-6,Bernadette>谢谢你
<12-6,Bernadette>Well, thank you.

422
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,330
<12-7,Penny>你是个好朋友  改变了我的人生
<12-7,Penny>You're a good friend, and you changed my life.

423
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,880
<12-8,Bernadette>不客气
<12-8,Bernadette>You're welcome.

424
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,550
<12-8,Bernadette>既然你现在也挣大钱了
<12-8,Bernadette>Hey, now that you're making some real money,

425
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,480
<12-8,Bernadette>可以请你的朋友出去吃顿大餐表示感谢啊
<12-8,Bernadette>maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.

426
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,230
<12-9,Penny>当然
<12-9,Penny>Sure.

427
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,090
<12-10,Amy>或许也应该带上你另一个朋友
<12-10,Amy>And you probably have to invite your other friend

428
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,600
<12-10,Amy>因为听者有份
<12-10,Amy>'cause she overheard you talking about it,

429
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,160
<12-10,Amy>不带她就太不对了
<12-10,Amy>and it would be awkward to exclude her.

430
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,790
<12-11,Penny>好的
<12-11,Penny>Okay.

432
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,450
<12-13,Penny>行吧
<12-13,Penny>All right.

433
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,670
<12-14,Bernadette>别忘带钱包
<12-14,Bernadette>Don't forget your wallet.

434
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,660
<12-14,Bernadette>我...
<12-14,Bernadette>I...

435
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,730
<13-1,Sheldon (on screen)>来自地球的问候

<13-1,Sheldon (on screen)>Just turn left at Alpha Centauri.
