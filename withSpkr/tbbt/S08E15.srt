1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,930
<1-1,Sheldon>我新编了一个科学笑话  想听吗
<1-1,Sheldon>I've invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,120
<1-2,Amy>好啊
<1-2,Amy>Sure.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,040
<1-3,Sheldon>换一个灯泡要多少个爱迪生呢
<1-3,Sheldon>How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,190
<1-4,Amy>几个
<1-4,Amy>How many?

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,150
<1-5,Sheldon>谁管他  他偷了灯泡这个创意
<1-5,Sheldon>Who cares? He stole the idea

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,690
<1-5,Sheldon>他不配有自己为主题的笑话
<1-5,Sheldon>and doesn't deserve his own joke.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,250
<1-6,Amy>这是真的吗
<1-6,Amy>Is that really true?

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,960
<1-7,Sheldon>当然  所以你才能知道这是个好笑话
<1-7,Sheldon>Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,960
<1-7,Sheldon>好笑话就是得寓教于乐
<1-7,Sheldon>It not only entertains, it informs.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,790
<1-8,Barry>抱歉打扰了
<1-8,Barry>Hey, sorry to interrupt.

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,970
<1-9,Sheldon>巴里
<1-9,Sheldon>Uh, Barry,

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,980
<1-9,Sheldon>换一个灯泡要多少个爱迪生呢
<1-9,Sheldon>uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,410
<1-10,Barry>你知道灯泡实际上不是爱迪生发明的吧
<1-10,Barry>Did you know Edison didn't actually invent the light bulb?

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,140
<1-11,Sheldon>你来干嘛  巴里
<1-11,Sheldon>What do you want, Barry?

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,140
<1-12,Barry>来给艾米送一份小小谢礼
<1-12,Barry>Just wanted to drop this off as a little thank you for Amy.

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,480
<1-13,Amy>为什么送我礼物
<1-13,Amy>What's this for?

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,280
<1-14,Barry>你的点子真的帮了我大忙
<1-14,Barry>Your idea really helped me out.

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,920
<1-14,Barry>我光锥量子化的论文已经发表到网上了
<1-14,Barry>My light-cone quantization paper's online already.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,420
<1-14,Barry>反响非常棒
<1-14,Barry>The response has been amazing.

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,510
<1-15,Amy>那太好了
<1-15,Amy>Well, that's fascinating.

22
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,890
<1-15,Amy>我迫不及待要去拜读了
<1-15,Amy>I can't wait to read it.

23
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,430
<1-16,Sheldon>我也是呢
<1-16,Sheldon>Oh, no, me as well.

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,810
<1-16,Sheldon>请发到我电子邮箱sheldon@bazinga.biz
<1-16,Sheldon>Uh, please e-mail it to sheldon@bazinga.biz.

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,980
<1-16,Sheldon>为什么是.biz[商]吗
<1-16,Sheldon>Why "Dot-biz"?

26
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,280
<1-16,Sheldon>因为我一招"商"得你体无完肤
<1-16,Sheldon>Because I just gave you the business.

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,950
<1-16,Sheldon>还因为bazinga.com被人先注册了
<1-16,Sheldon>And also bazinga.com was taken.

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,470
<1-17,Barry>好啦  再次谢谢你
<1-17,Barry>Anyway, thanks again.

29
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,890
<1-17,Barry>库伯  去"吃鸡..."蛋吧
<1-17,Barry>Cooper, suck eggs.

30
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,940
<1-18,Sheldon>你什么时候去帮巴里·克里普奇了
<1-18,Sheldon>Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,320
<1-19,Amy>我最近在思考通过元胞自动机来
<1-19,Amy>Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,520
<1-19,Amy>研究神经元连接
<1-19,Amy>to neuronal connectivity,

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,370
<1-19,Amy>然后我觉得这可能对弦理论研究
<1-19,Amy>and I thought it might have some interesting applications

34
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,790
<1-19,Amy>有些不错的用途  小忙不值得一提啦
<1-19,Amy>to string theory-- it's not a big deal.

35
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,200
<1-20,Sheldon>是吗
<1-20,Sheldon>Oh, really?

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,740
<1-20,Sheldon>我研究弦理论走进死胡同那会儿
<1-20,Sheldon>When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end,

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,410
<1-20,Sheldon>你怎么没想过来帮我呢
<1-20,Sheldon>why didn't you try to help me?

38
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,450
<1-21,Amy>我有啊  你说生物学家唯一懂的数学
<1-21,Amy>I did-- you said the only math biologists know is

39
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,550
<1-21,Amy>就是如果有三只青蛙  一只跳走了
<1-21,Amy>if you have three frogs and one hops away,

40
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,280
<1-21,Amy>那还剩下两只
<1-21,Amy>that leaves two frogs.

41
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,460
<1-22,Sheldon>还挺有哏的  的确像是我会说的话
<1-22,Sheldon>That's pretty funny, that does sound like me.

42
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,390
<1-22,Sheldon>但这也不代表
<1-22,Sheldon>But that doesn't mean

43
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,190
<1-22,Sheldon>你就可以去站街边
<1-22,Sheldon>that you should be standing on street corners

44
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,820
<1-22,Sheldon>随便男人经过  就把你的计算给人家啊
<1-22,Sheldon>handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,600
<1-23,Amy>谢尔顿  我们都是科学家
<1-23,Amy>Sheldon, we're all scientists.

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,370
<1-23,Amy>我就是帮忙一个同事
<1-23,Amy>I helped out a fellow colleague.

47
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,740
<1-23,Amy>你要不要这么小气
<1-23,Amy>You're being petty.

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,380
<1-23,Amy>我小气吗
<1-23,Amy>I'm being petty?

49
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,370
<1-24,Sheldon>你明知道我跟巴里是职场上宿敌
<1-24,Sheldon>You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry.

50
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,780
<1-24,Sheldon>你也听到他说的了  他叫我去"吃鸡..."蛋
<1-24,Sheldon>You heard him-- he told me to suck eggs.

51
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,680
<1-24,Sheldon>如果我跟他是朋友  那他就会叫我去
<1-24,Sheldon>If we were friends, he would have suggested

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,740
<1-24,Sheldon>吃些比较令人爽快的东西
<1-24,Sheldon>I suck something more pleasant.

53
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,180
<1-24,Sheldon>你笑什么
<1-24,Sheldon>Why are you laughing?

54
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,290
<1-24,Sheldon>你是不是学坏了
<1-24,Sheldon>Did you learn something?

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,460
<2-1,Howard (on phone)>好的  妈
<2-1,Howard (on phone)>Okay, Ma.

62
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,090
<2-1,Howard (on phone)>替我跟格莱蒂斯阿姨问好
<2-1,Howard (on phone)>Say hi to Aunt Gladys.

63
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,360
<2-1,Howard (on phone)>我也爱你
<2-1,Howard (on phone)>Yeah, I love you, too.

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,700
<2-1,Howard (on phone)>再见
<2-1,Howard (on phone)>Bye.

65
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,310
<2-2,Bernadette>你妈妈在佛罗里达玩得开心吗
<2-2,Bernadette>Your mom having fun in Florida?

66
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,530
<2-3,Howard>她很喜欢那里
<2-3,Howard>Mmm, she loves it.

67
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,510
<2-3,Howard>她终于找到个春暖花开  大家都在讨论
<2-3,Howard>She finally found a place where everyone talks about

68
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,720
<2-3,Howard>流了多少汗的地方
<2-3,Howard>how sweaty they are.

69
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,800
<2-3,Howard>总之  她是想我们回她家
<2-3,Howard>Anyway, she wants us to go to the house

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,430
<2-3,Howard>去看看斯图尔特会不会太"孤单"
<2-3,Howard>and check in on Stuart because he might be "lonely."

71
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,790
<2-4,Bernadette>她只是人很好嘛
<2-4,Bernadette>She's just being nice.

72
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,670
<2-5,Howard>我是他宝贝儿子  她怎么就不找人
<2-5,Howard>Well, I'm her son, how come she doesn't send someone

73
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,900
<2-5,Howard>来看看我孤不孤单
<2-5,Howard>to check on me if I'm lonely?

74
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,040
<2-6,Bernadette>因为你有个老婆
<2-6,Bernadette>Because you have a wife.

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,980
<2-7,Howard>是没错  可是有时候你下班好晚
<2-7,Howard>Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.

76
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,690
<2-8,Bernadette>我知道你不喜欢斯图尔特赖在你家
<2-8,Bernadette>I know you don't like Stuart being in the house,

77
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,000
<2-8,Bernadette>但他的店马上要重新开张了
<2-8,Bernadette>but the store's about to reopen,

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,680
<2-8,Bernadette>我相信他很快又能自食其力
<2-8,Bernadette>I'm sure he'll get back on his feet.

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,430
<2-8,Bernadette>那就太好了
<2-8,Bernadette>That would be great.

80
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,780
<2-9,Howard>我也非常想跟我妈的关系回到正常
<2-9,Howard>I'd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.

81
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,480
<2-10,Bernadette>"正常"这词有点言过其实  但你说是就是吧
<2-10,Bernadette>Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.

82
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
<3-2,Sheldon>-好啊  -好...
<3-2,Sheldon>- Hey. - Hello.

83
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,600
<3-3,Penny>你还好吧
<3-3,Penny>You okay?

84
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,510
<3-4,Sheldon>如果我还好  我会说  "好!"
<3-4,Sheldon>If I was okay, I would've said "Hello"

85
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,180
<3-4,Sheldon>而不是语气很衰的"好..."
<3-4,Sheldon>and not the much more ominous "Hello."

86
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,160
<3-5,Penny>怎么啦
<3-5,Penny>What's going on?

87
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,970
<3-6,Sheldon>我在生艾米的气
<3-6,Sheldon>I'm mad at Amy.

88
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,900
<3-7,Penny>她也在你最爱的无袖背心腋下留下汗渍了吗
<3-7,Penny>Did she leave pit stains in your favorite crop top, too?

89
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,890
<3-7,Penny>没有
<3-7,Penny>No.

90
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,830
<3-8,Sheldon>她帮巴里·克里普奇在线理论上做出突破
<3-8,Sheldon>She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.

91
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,900
<3-9,Penny>听起来挺好的啊
<3-9,Penny>Oh, that sounds like a good thing.

92
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,860
<3-10,Sheldon>照理来说是  可是我已经不研究弦理论了
<3-10,Sheldon>Well, it would be, except that I left string theory

93
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
<3-10,Sheldon>因为我觉得那是条死路
<3-10,Sheldon>because I decided it was a dead end.

94
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,760
<3-10,Sheldon>而她背着我
<3-10,Sheldon>Yeah, and then she went behind my back

95
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,660
<3-10,Sheldon>跑去帮忙别人证明我错了
<3-10,Sheldon>to help someone else prove me wrong.

96
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,910
<3-10,Sheldon>而且还是帮我的宿敌
<3-10,Sheldon>My rival, no less.

97
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,200
<3-10,Sheldon>抱歉让你看到了这一幕
<3-10,Sheldon>I'm sorry you had to see that.

98
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,630
<3-11,Penny>我只遗憾我手边没相机
<3-11,Penny>I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.

99
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,540
<3-12,Sheldon>她为什么要这么对我呢
<3-12,Sheldon>Why would she do this to me?

100
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,230
<3-13,Penny>我想她不是故意要惹你生气
<3-13,Penny>Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose.

101
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,570
<3-13,Penny>而且你不是总说
<3-13,Penny>Besides, aren't you the one who says

102
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,650
<3-13,Penny>没有什么是比让科学进步更重要的吗
<3-13,Penny>there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?

103
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,710
<3-14,Sheldon>我说的是  没有什么比
<3-14,Sheldon>No, I said there's nothing more important

104
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,630
<3-14,Sheldon>"我"让科学进步更重要的
<3-14,Sheldon>than me advancing science.

105
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,170
<3-15,Penny>好吧  如果我没理解错
<3-15,Penny>All right, well, if I'm understanding this right,

106
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,560
<3-15,Penny>而她也真的只是帮忙了别的科学家
<3-15,Penny>and all she did was help out another scientist,

107
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,570
<3-15,Penny>我觉得你对这件事应该就算了吧
<3-15,Penny>I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.

108
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,170
<5-26,Sheldon>"算了吧"
<5-26,Sheldon>Ugh, "Let it go."

109
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,880
<3-16,Sheldon>这句话我听了一辈子了
<3-16,Sheldon>I have heard that my whole life.

110
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,660
<3-16,Sheldon>每次我有事情不开心  就有人让我"算了吧"
<3-16,Sheldon>Every time something upsets me somebody says, "Let it go,"

111
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,060
<3-16,Sheldon>说得好像都是我的问题
<3-16,Sheldon>you know, like it's my fault,

112
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,340
<3-16,Sheldon>我有不高兴的情绪是不对的
<3-16,Sheldon>and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.

113
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,560
<3-17,Penny>我不知道该说什么了
<3-17,Penny>I don't know what to tell you.

114
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,150
<3-17,Penny>你何不跟她谈谈呢
<3-17,Penny>I mean, why don't you talk to her?

115
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,130
<3-18,Sheldon>你就这点能耐吗
<3-18,Sheldon>Is that all you have?

116
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,240
<3-18,Sheldon>"跟她谈"和"算了吧"这种陈腔滥调的方法招数
<3-18,Sheldon>Shopworn tidbits like "talk to her" and "let it go"?

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
<3-18,Sheldon>佩妮  生活给了我又酸又苦的柠檬
<3-18,Sheldon>Gee, Penny, life's giving me lemons.

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,390
<3-18,Sheldon>我该怎么办
<3-18,Sheldon>What should I do?

119
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,030
<3-19,Penny>你可以找个"地方"塞进去呀
<3-19,Penny>Well, you could shove them somewhere.

120
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,440
<3-20,Sheldon>好吧  现在你会发散思维了
<3-20,Sheldon>Okay, now you're getting creative.

121
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,630
<4-1,Stuart>再次感谢你们来帮忙
<4-1,Stuart>Thanks again for your help.

122
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,670
<4-3,Raj>-不用谢  -别客气
<4-3,Raj>- No problem. - Our pleasure.

123
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,000
<4-4,Leonard>这地方看起来真棒
<4-4,Leonard>The place really looks great.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
<4-5,Raj>是啊  你应该早几年放火烧掉的
<4-5,Raj>Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.

125
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,830
<4-6,Stuart>我再三地告诉你们  不是我故意烧掉的
<4-6,Stuart>I keep telling you I didn't burn it down.

126
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,390
<4-7,Leonard>我们知道  因为为了骗保险金
<4-7,Leonard>We know, we know-- because burning something down

127
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,930
<4-7,Leonard>而故意纵火  那叫"犯罪"
<4-7,Leonard>for the insurance money is a "crime."

128
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,810
<4-8,Bernadette>斯尔图特  这地方简直焕然一新呀
<4-8,Bernadette>Stuart, this place looks amazing.

129
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,830
<4-9,Stuart>谢谢
<4-9,Stuart>Thanks.

130
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,580
<4-10,Howard>看得出来你很用心
<4-10,Howard>You really did a nice job.

131
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,360
<4-11,Stuart>谢谢你在这整段过程中
<4-11,Stuart>And thank you for putting up with me

132
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,020
<4-11,Stuart>容忍我住在你妈家里
<4-11,Stuart>staying at your mom's through all this.

133
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,200
<4-11,Stuart>否则我也不能重开这家店
<4-11,Stuart>I-I couldn't have done it otherwise.

134
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,520
<4-12,Howard>别说客套话了  我很高兴你能...
<4-12,Howard>I appreciate that, and I'm glad you were able to...

135
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,860
<4-12,Howard>那是我妈的家具吗
<4-12,Howard>Is that my mother's furniture?

136
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,400
<4-13,Stuart>是啊  她说我可以搬过来用
<4-13,Stuart>Yeah, she said I could use it.

137
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,040
<4-13,Stuart>看起来很搭吧
<4-13,Stuart>Doesn't it look great?

138
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,300
<4-14,Howard>还是放小房间里比较搭  因为它只属于那里
<4-14,Howard>Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.

139
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,030
<4-15,Bernadette>华仔
<4-15,Bernadette>Howie.

140
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,620
<4-16,Howard>你何不索性把整个房间都搬空算了
<4-16,Howard>Why don't you just clean out the whole room?

141
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,190
<4-16,Howard>把我三年级给我妈做的手工彩线小丑拿走啊
<4-16,Howard>Take the string art clown I made her in third grade

142
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,370
<4-16,Howard>再随便把我参加游泳班
<4-16,Howard>and the ribbon I got in swim class

143
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,570
<4-16,Howard>在水里憋气赢来的缎带奖拿走啊
<4-16,Howard>for putting my face in the water.

144
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,900
<4-17,Stuart>你干嘛生气啊
<4-17,Stuart>What is your problem?

145
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,110
<4-17,Stuart>你妈都不介意了
<4-17,Stuart>She said it was okay.

146
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,750
<4-18,Howard>我是她的儿子  我很介意
<4-18,Howard>Well, I'm her son, and I say it's not okay.

147
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,270
<4-19,Stuart>哪门子的儿子  那手工小丑你也就花了十分钟做的吧
<4-19,Stuart>Some son-- looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.

148
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,030
<4-20,Howard>或许我应该像你一样去念名牌艺术学校
<4-20,Howard>Well, maybe I should've gone to a fancy art school like you.

149
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,570
<4-20,Howard>然后开一家失败的漫画店
<4-20,Howard>Then I could run a failed comic shop

150
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,960
<4-20,Howard>店倒了就去骗其他人妈妈的钱
<4-20,Howard>and mooch off some guy's mother.

151
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,640
<4-21,Bernadette>我们先走吧  让你冷静一下
<4-21,Bernadette>Why don't we leave so you can cool off?

152
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,380
<4-22,Stuart>这主意不错
<4-22,Stuart>I think that's a good idea.

153
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,550
<4-22,Stuart>快带他离开我的店
<4-22,Stuart>Take him out of my store.

154
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,330
<4-23,Howard>你的店
<4-23,Howard>Your store?!

155
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,280
<4-23,Howard>你重开店的钱还是我妈给的
<4-23,Howard>My mother gave you the money to reopen.

156
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,620
<4-23,Howard>我哪儿也不去
<4-23,Howard>I'm not going anywhere.

157
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,080
<4-24,Leonard>要不我们去给派对买点吃的吧
<4-24,Leonard>Why don't we go get the food for the party.

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,170
<4-25,Stuart>麻烦你们了
<4-25,Stuart>Thank you.

159
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,530
<4-26,Raj>聪明  这样看起来我们好像在帮忙
<4-26,Raj>Smart-- looks like we're being helpful.

160
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,140
<4-27,Leonard>其实我们只是想快点逃离这个难堪的场面
<4-27,Leonard>Mmm, when really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation.

161
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,520
<5-1,Sheldon>为什么偏偏要帮巴里·克里普奇呢
<5-1,Sheldon>Kripke, you know, of all the people-- Barry Kripke.

162
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,510
<5-1,Sheldon>我超....你是故意像个疯子一样叠衣服
<5-1,Sheldon>I'm so... Are you folding it like a crazy person

163
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,520
<5-1,Sheldon>好让我看不过眼帮你吗
<5-1,Sheldon>to get me to do it for you?!

164
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,900
<5-2,Penny>不是啊
<5-2,Penny>No.

165
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,450
<5-3,Sheldon>算了  我来吧
<5-3,Sheldon>Oh, give me that.

166
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,220
<5-3,Sheldon>我很好奇
<5-3,Sheldon>Just out of curiosity,

167
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,190
<5-3,Sheldon>如果我想放下某件事
<5-3,Sheldon>if I were to let something go,

168
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,800
<5-3,Sheldon>我该怎么做到呢
<5-3,Sheldon>how would I do that?

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,610
<5-4,Penny>我不知道  想想其他事情试试
<5-4,Penny>I don't know-- just think about something else.

170
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,880
<5-5,Sheldon>我可以想食蚁兽吗
<5-5,Sheldon>Can I think about the spiny anteater?

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,000
<5-5,Sheldon>可以啊
<5-5,Sheldon>Sure.

172
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,740
<5-5,Sheldon>食蚁兽
<5-5,Sheldon>The spiny anteater...

173
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,020
<5-7,Sheldon>从来没背着我去帮忙巴里·克里普奇
<5-7,Sheldon>never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke.

174
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,220
<5-7,Sheldon>这招一点用都没有
<5-7,Sheldon>That didn't help at all.

175
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,380
<5-8,Penny>有些人会尝试运用观想术
<5-8,Penny>You know, some people try visualization.

176
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,010
<5-9,Sheldon>那要怎么做
<5-9,Sheldon>How does that work?

177
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,540
<5-11,Sheldon>好
<5-11,Sheldon>Okay,

178
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,810
<5-10,Penny>想象你的问题是一支笔
<5-10,Penny>imagine your problems are a pen.

179
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,410
<5-11,Sheldon>好的
<5-11,Sheldon>Okay.

180
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,560
<5-12,Penny>现在想象你握着那支笔
<5-12,Penny>Now imagine you're holding that pen.

181
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,800
<5-11,Sheldon>好的
<5-11,Sheldon>Okay.

182
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,060
<5-14,Penny>现在松开手  让笔掉下来[算了吧]
<5-14,Penny>Now open your hand and let it go.

183
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,130
<5-15,Sheldon>可我才拿到这支笔
<5-15,Sheldon>But I just got this pen.

184
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,050
<5-15,Sheldon>上面有我名字的首字母缩写呢
<5-15,Sheldon>It's got my initials on it and everything.

185
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,560
<5-15,Sheldon>你看
<5-15,Sheldon>Look.

186
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,510
<5-16,Penny>谢尔顿  这没有那么难
<5-16,Penny>Sheldon, this isn't that hard.

187
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,910
<5-17,Sheldon>我或许有个让你教我的更好办法
<5-17,Sheldon>I may have a better way that you can teach me.

188
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,080
<5-18,Penny>怎么做
<5-18,Penny>How?

189
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,840
<5-19,Sheldon>如果我告诉你  在过去几个月里
<5-19,Sheldon>What if I told you that over the past few months

190
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,750
<5-19,Sheldon>艾米在暗中悄悄让你做一些智力小难题
<5-19,Sheldon>Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles

191
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,930
<5-19,Sheldon>就为了对比你和她实验室黑猩猩谁更聪明
<5-19,Sheldon>to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?

192
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,300
<5-20,Penny>什么  她才没让我解决什么小难题呢
<5-20,Penny>What? She didn't give me any puzzles.

193
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
<5-21,Sheldon>你确定吗
<5-21,Sheldon>Are you sure?

194
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,250
<5-22,Amy (in flashback)>天啊  我把剪刀弄成两半装不回来了
<5-22,Amy (in flashback)>Boy, I just can't seem to get these scissors back together.

195
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,920
<5-22,Amy (in flashback)>你能帮个忙吗
<5-22,Amy (in flashback)>Can you do it?

196
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,860
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>糟糕
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>Darn it.

197
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,830
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>我的眼睛进东西了
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>There's something in my eye,

198
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,610
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>我得把这些硬币按大小分类
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>and I need to sort these coins by size.

199
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,180
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>你能帮个忙吗
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>Can you help?

200
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,200
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>佩妮
<5-23,Amy (in flashback)>Penny?

201
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,800
<5-24,Amy (in flashback)>我超级想吃香蕉
<5-24,Amy (in flashback)>I really want to eat this banana,

202
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,780
<5-24,Amy (in flashback)>但它被卡在这个竹子机关箱了
<5-24,Amy (in flashback)>but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.

203
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,050
<5-25,Penny>那个科学婊
<5-25,Penny>Son of a bitch!

204
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,700
<5-26,Sheldon>太好了
<5-26,Sheldon>Okay, that's great.

205
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,670
<5-26,Sheldon>现在想  算了吧
<5-26,Sheldon>Now, let it go.

206
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,170
<5-27,Penny>你们居然把我和黑猩猩拿来做测试对比
<5-27,Penny>I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp!

207
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,730
<5-28,Sheldon>抱歉  测试你的人是艾米
<5-28,Sheldon>Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you.

208
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,470
<5-28,Sheldon>我可是很看好你哦
<5-28,Sheldon>I was rooting for you.

209
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,570
<5-28,Sheldon>对了  打开机关箱那次做得很不错哟
<5-28,Sheldon>Good job on that banana box, by the way.

210
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,070
<5-29,Penny>她为什么要这样做
<5-29,Penny>Why would she even do this?

211
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,290
<5-30,Sheldon>艾米在对人猿进行一系列实验
<5-30,Sheldon>She's been conducting an experiment on apes

212
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,540
<5-30,Sheldon>给它们各种难题  让它们解决
<5-30,Sheldon>where they're given various puzzles to solve.

213
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,180
<5-30,Sheldon>我对难题的复杂度表示惊讶
<5-30,Sheldon>I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles

214
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,410
<5-30,Sheldon>觉得可能有些人类都未必能解决
<5-30,Sheldon>and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them.

215
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,730
<5-30,Sheldon>于是艾米就说  "想让实验变得更有趣吗"
<5-30,Sheldon>That's when Amy said, "Want to make this interesting?"

216
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,300
<5-31,Penny>"让实验变得有趣"
<5-31,Penny>"Make this interesting"?

217
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,820
<5-31,Penny>你们还拿我开赌盘了吗
<5-31,Penny>You bet money on me?

218
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,080
<5-32,Sheldon>当然不
<5-32,Sheldon>No, no.

219
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,780
<5-32,Sheldon>我们设计了让你参与其中的实验
<5-32,Sheldon>We designed an experiment involving you.

220
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,150
<5-32,Sheldon>瞧  这样是不是很有趣呀
<5-32,Sheldon>See? Now, isn't that interesting?

221
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,650
<5-33,Penny>这一点都不有趣
<5-33,Penny>It's not interesting.

222
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,480
<5-33,Penny>简直太侮辱人了
<5-33,Penny>It's incredibly insulting.

223
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,820
<5-34,Sheldon>好吧  或许这样会有用
<5-34,Sheldon>Okay, maybe this will help--

224
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,570
<5-34,Sheldon>想象你拿着一支笔
<5-34,Sheldon>imagine you're holding a pen.

225
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,680
<5-34,Sheldon>别想太多  就是一支普通的笔
<5-34,Sheldon>Before you go too far, not a special pen

226
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,240
<5-34,Sheldon>上面没有刻你的姓名首字母
<5-34,Sheldon>with your initials engraved on it--

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,610
<5-34,Sheldon>不然下一步会很难做
<5-34,Sheldon>that'll make the next part really hard.

228
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,630
<5-36,Sheldon>够了
<5-36,Sheldon>That's it.

229
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,670
<5-37,Penny>出去
<5-37,Penny>Get out!

230
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,830
<5-36,Sheldon>我不懂你为啥要冲我发火
<5-36,Sheldon>I don't understand why you're mad at me.

231
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,400
<5-36,Sheldon>你应该朝艾米发火
<5-36,Sheldon>You should be mad at Amy.

232
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
<5-36,Sheldon>跟我下午的时候一样
<5-36,Sheldon>Like I was this afternoon.

233
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,490
<5-36,Sheldon>你瞧  我已经算了
<5-36,Sheldon>Hey, look at that-- I let it go.

234
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,580
<5-37,Penny>出去
<5-37,Penny>Get out!

235
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,350
<5-38,Sheldon>-佩妮  -干嘛
<5-38,Sheldon>- Penny? - What?

236
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,850
<5-40,Sheldon>我好像把笔留在里面了
<5-40,Sheldon>I think I left my pen in there.

237
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,020
<6-1,Bernadette>我懂你为什么不开心
<6-1,Bernadette>I understand why you're upset,

238
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,450
<6-1,Bernadette>可是他真的很努力地准备开店
<6-1,Bernadette>but he worked really hard to get the store ready.

239
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,930
<6-1,Bernadette>不过是一些家具
<6-1,Bernadette>And it's just furniture.

240
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,720
<6-1,Bernadette>是我妈的家具
<6-1,Bernadette>It's my mom's furniture.

241
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,370
<6-2,Howard>属于我从小长大的房子
<6-2,Howard>It belongs in the house I grew up in--

242
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,140
<6-2,Howard>就放在那堆电视节目表旁边
<6-2,Howard>next to that pile of TV Guides

243
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,870
<6-2,Howard>在一个十岁孩子的眼里
<6-2,Howard>and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old,

244
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,170
<6-2,Howard>可是很棒的线条艺术
<6-2,Howard>was a quality piece of string art!

245
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,760
<6-3,Bernadette>华仔  等漫画店成功
<6-3,Bernadette>Howie, if the store succeeds,

246
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,130
<6-3,Bernadette>斯图尔特有了收入
<6-3,Bernadette>Stuart has a source of income,

247
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,060
<6-3,Bernadette>他就能搬出你妈的房子
<6-3,Bernadette>and he can move out of your mother's house.

248
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,030
<6-3,Bernadette>付出这些旧家具作为代价
<6-3,Bernadette>Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price

249
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,880
<6-3,Bernadette>还是挺划算的
<6-3,Bernadette>to pay for that.

250
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,760
<6-4,Howard>这倒是个好理由
<6-4,Howard>That is a good point.

251
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,230
<6-4,Howard>可是我跟你结婚不是为了好理由
<6-4,Howard>But I didn't marry you for good points.

252
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,460
<6-4,Howard>我跟你结婚是为了
<6-4,Howard>I married you to blindly support me

253
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,120
<6-4,Howard>不管我有多荒谬  你都会盲目支持我
<6-4,Howard>no matter how ridiculous I'm being!

254
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,010
<6-5,Bernadette>所以我才改写了我们的结婚誓言啊
<6-5,Bernadette>This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.

255
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,820
<7-1,Leonard>你好  我们来拿漫画中心订的餐
<7-1,Leonard>Hi, we're here to pick up an order for Comic Center.

256
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,110
<7-2,Waitress>好  让我查一下
<7-2,Waitress>Sure, let me go check on that.

257
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,850
<7-3,Raj>我觉得那是内森·菲利安
<7-3,Raj>Dude, I-I think that's Nathan Fillion.

258
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,820
<7-4,Leonard>真的是他
<7-4,Leonard>Oh yeah, look at that.

259
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,870
<7-5,Raj>他正在挑掉番茄里的沙拉
<7-5,Raj>And he's picking the tomatoes out of his salad

260
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,580
<7-5,Raj>跟我一样
<7-5,Raj>just like I do.

261
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,390
<7-5,Raj>我一直觉得自己跟他有缘
<7-5,Raj>I always did feel a connection with him.

262
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,550
<7-5,Raj>我有个主意
<7-5,Raj>Oh, I have got an idea.

263
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,010
<7-6,Leonard>我们不会去拍卖网站上卖他的番茄
<7-6,Leonard>We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.

264
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,830
<7-7,Raj>如果我们能让《萤火虫》里的雷诺兹船长
<7-7,Raj>No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly

265
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,030
<7-7,Raj>去斯图尔特的店办签名会
<7-7,Raj>to do a signing at Stuart's store,

266
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,510
<7-8,Leonard>那一定超棒
<7-8,Leonard>that would be amazing.

267
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,970
<7-8,Leonard>一定很棒
<7-8,Leonard>That would be great.

268
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,890
<7-9,Raj>所以我们要过去搭话吗
<7-9,Raj>So should we go talk to him?

269
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,140
<7-9,Raj>我不知道
<7-9,Raj>I don't know.

270
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,450
<7-10,Leonard>如果他态度不好  以后他演的剧
<7-10,Leonard>I mean, if he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me

271
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,860
<7-10,Leonard>-我就没法看了  -屁咧
<7-10,Leonard>- to watch him in anything again. - What?!

272
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,600
<7-11,Raj>演琼恩·雪诺的是个混蛋
<7-11,Raj>The-the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk.

273
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,120
<7-11,Raj>我们还是在看《权利的游戏》啊
<7-11,Raj>We still watch Game of Thrones.

274
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,020
<7-12,Leonard>他是混蛋是因为你追了他的尾
<7-12,Leonard>He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.

275
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,370
<7-13,Raj>我注意力被分散了嘛
<7-13,Raj>I was distracted.

276
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,410
<7-13,Raj>一个守夜人的车上绑着皮划艇
<7-13,Raj>It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch

277
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,210
<7-13,Raj>确实很奇怪嘛
<7-13,Raj>with a kayak strapped to his car.

278
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,040
<7-13,Raj>来吧
<7-13,Raj>Come on.

279
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,790
<7-13,Raj>你好 抱歉
<7-13,Raj>Hi, excuse me, s-s...

280
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,260
<7-17,Leonard>我们不想打扰您
<7-17,Leonard>I-I don't mean to bother you,

281
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,200
<7-13,Raj>可我们真的非常喜欢《萤火虫》
<7-13,Raj>but we're just really big fans of Firefly.

282
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,010
<7-13,Raj>还有《恐怖博士》
<7-13,Raj>A-And Dr. Horrible.

283
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,990
<7-14,Nathan Fillion>你们认错人了
<7-14,Nathan Fillion>Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake.

284
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,640
<7-14,Nathan Fillion>我不是演员
<7-14,Nathan Fillion>I'm not an actor.

285
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,540
<7-15,Raj>别这么说
<7-15,Raj>Don't say that.

286
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,070
<7-15,Raj>虽然没到朱迪·丹奇女爵士的等级
<7-15,Raj>I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench,

288
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,020
<7-15,Raj>但你也挺不错的
<7-15,Raj>but you're pretty great.

289
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,360
<7-16,Nathan Fillion>我懂了  你们以为我是内森·菲利安
<7-16,Nathan Fillion>Oh, yeah, I get it-- you think I'm Nathan Fillion,

291
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,250
<7-15,Raj>可我不是
<7-15,Raj>but I'm not.

292
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,840
<7-16,Nathan Fillion>你们要是不介意  我想继续吃午饭了
<7-16,Nathan Fillion>So if you don't mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.

293
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,150
<7-17,Leonard>走吧
<7-17,Leonard>Come on.

294
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,970
<7-17,Leonard>很抱歉打扰您了
<7-17,Leonard>Sorry to bother you.

295
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,430
<7-18,Raj>真不懂他脾气怎么这么差
<7-18,Raj>Don't know why he's so grumpy.

296
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,460
<7-18,Raj>上次有人误以为我演了《少年派》
<7-18,Raj>I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once,

298
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,070
<7-18,Raj>我到现在还飘飘然呢
<7-18,Raj>and I'm still floating.

299
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,840
<8-1,Amy>谢尔顿  是我
<8-1,Amy>Sheldon, it's me.

300
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
<8-1,Amy>你好
<8-1,Amy>Oh, hey.

301
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,080
<8-2,Penny>你看到了吗
<8-2,Penny>D-Did you see that?

302
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,470
<8-2,Penny>我自己找出了开门的方法
<8-2,Penny>I-I figured out how to open the door all by myself.

303
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,140
<8-2,Penny>我是不是该在笼子里扔粪庆祝啊
<8-2,Penny>Maybe I'll fling some feces around my cage to celebrate.

304
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,490
<8-3,Amy>你在说什么
<8-3,Amy>What are you talking about?

305
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,630
<8-4,Penny>我知道你秘密拿我做实验
<8-4,Penny>I know you've been giving me secret puzzle tests.

306
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,660
<8-5,Amy>谢尔顿  开门
<8-5,Amy>Sheldon, open the door.

307
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,320
<8-5,Amy>我不能开
<8-5,Amy>I can't.

308
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,630
<8-6,Sheldon>我光着呢
<8-6,Sheldon>I'm naked.

309
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,470
<8-7,Amy>我刚看到你了
<8-7,Amy>I just saw you.

310
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,390
<8-8,Sheldon>等一下
<8-8,Sheldon>Hang on.

311
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,380
<8-9,Penny>现在开门
<8-9,Penny>Open the door now.

312
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,790
<8-11,Penny>把裤子穿上
<8-11,Penny>Pull up your pants!

313
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,660
<8-11,Penny>这没什么大不了的
<8-11,Penny>It's not a big deal.

314
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,520
<8-12,Amy>我本科的时候经常做这种实验
<8-12,Amy>I run tests like this on undergrads all the time.

315
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,250
<8-12,Amy>如果你在大学里填写一些问卷
<8-12,Amy>If you fill out some paperwork at the university,

316
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,550
<8-12,Amy>我可以给你五块钱
<8-12,Amy>I can get you $5.

317
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,220
<8-13,Penny>谁稀罕你的五块钱
<8-13,Penny>I don't want $5.

318
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,400
<8-13,Penny>我要的是尊严
<8-13,Penny>I want my dignity.

319
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,180
<8-14,Amy>那你到底要多少  十块吗
<8-14,Amy>So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?

320
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,380
<9-2,Raj>-谢谢  -谢谢
<9-2,Raj>- Thank you. - Thanks.

321
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,160
<9-3,Leonard>-再次抱歉  -没关系
<9-3,Leonard>- Sorry again. - No problem.

322
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,820
<9-5,Raj>你确定你不是他吗
<9-5,Raj>A-Are you sure you're not him?

323
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,120
<9-5,Raj>你可以告诉我们的
<9-5,Raj>Uh, you can tell us.

324
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,420
<9-5,Raj>我们是科学家  不是什么狂热粉
<9-5,Raj>We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.

325
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,390
<9-6,Nathan Fillion>好吧
<9-6,Nathan Fillion>All right, fine.

326
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,900
<9-6,Nathan Fillion>我就是他
<9-6,Nathan Fillion>I'm him.

327
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,210
<9-7,Raj>结果你自己一个人在熟食店吃饭吗
<9-7,Raj>And you're eating alone at a deli.

328
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,760
<9-7,Raj>我不信  你不是他
<9-7,Raj>I don't buy it-- you're not him.

329
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,580
<9-8,Nathan Fillion>我就想安静地吃个午饭
<9-8,Nathan Fillion>I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace.

330
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,750
<9-8,Nathan Fillion>不过我确实是他
<9-8,Nathan Fillion>But I really am him.

331
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,850
<9-8,Nathan Fillion>多谢你们能成为我的粉丝
<9-8,Nathan Fillion>And thank you very much for being a fan.

332
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,690
<9-8,Nathan Fillion>你们要是想可以跟我合照
<9-8,Nathan Fillion>If you want, uh, let's take a picture.

333
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,210
<9-10,Raj>-那太好了  -好啊
<9-10,Raj>- That would be great. - Great.

334
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,160
<9-11,Leonard>-谢谢  -当然
<9-11,Leonard>- Yeah, thank you. - You bet.

335
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,520
<9-13,Raj>等等
<9-13,Raj>Wait, hang on.

336
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,110
<9-13,Raj>如果你真的是内森·菲利安
<9-13,Raj>If you're really Nathan Fillion,

337
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,440
<9-13,Raj>《萤火虫》里关于你帽子那句台词是什么
<9-13,Raj>what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?

338
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,410
<9-14,Nathan Fillion>"以我美丽的花帽子起誓  我要了结了你"
<9-14,Nathan Fillion>"I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you."

339
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,730
<9-15,Leonard>没错  就是这句
<9-15,Leonard>That's it, that's the line.

340
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,160
<9-16,Raj>不过...
<9-16,Raj>Although...

341
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,590
<9-16,Raj>我也知道台词  但我也不是内森·菲利安啊
<9-16,Raj>I knew the line-- doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.

342
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,390
<9-17,Nathan Fillion>你到底想不想拍照了
<9-17,Nathan Fillion>Do you want the picture or not?

343
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,270
<9-18,Raj>我想和内森·菲利安拍照
<9-18,Raj>I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.

344
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,480
<9-19,Nathan>跟一个长的像内森·菲利安  但是要比
<9-19,Nathan>How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion

345
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,970
<9-19,Nathan>平时的内森·菲利安更暴走一点的人呢
<9-19,Nathan>but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?

346
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,080
<9-20,Leonard>你怎么说
<9-20,Leonard>What do you think?

347
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,860
<9-21,Raj>放脸书上是够了
<9-21,Raj>Eh, it's good enough for Facebook.

348
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,640
<10-1,Leonard>不敢相信他们居然那么做
<10-1,Leonard>I can't believe they did that.

349
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,650
<10-2,Penny>我知道  太侮辱人了
<10-2,Penny>I know-- it's so insulting.

350
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,340
<10-2,Penny>有一次  他们还让我把香蕉
<10-2,Penny>At one point, they had me figure out

351
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,690
<10-2,Penny>从一个机关盒里拿出来
<10-2,Penny>how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.

352
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,290
<10-3,Leonard>等等  谢尔顿也给过我香蕉盒
<10-3,Leonard>Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box.

353
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,490
<10-3,Leonard>他也在测试我
<10-3,Leonard>He was testing me, too.

354
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,420
<10-4,Penny>难以置信
<10-4,Penny>Unbelievable.

355
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,410
<10-5,Leonard>而且黑猩猩怎么可能打开嘛
<10-5,Leonard>And how could a chimp even solve that?

356
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,050
<10-5,Leonard>根本不可能
<10-5,Leonard>That was impossible.

357
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,660
<10-6,Penny>真的吗  你没拿出来吗
<10-6,Penny>Really? You couldn't get it out?

358
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,140
<10-7,Sheldon>谢谢
<10-7,Sheldon>Thank you.

359
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,140
<10-8,Amy>这商店太棒了
<10-8,Amy>Wow, the store looks great.

360
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,140
<10-9,Leonard>你们对我俩都做测试了吗
<10-9,Leonard>So you guys were testing us both?

361
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,170
<10-9,Leonard>你们脑子有啥毛病啊
<10-9,Leonard>What is the matter with you?

362
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,690
<10-10,Penny>他们的毛病就是
<10-10,Penny>Eh, what's the matter with them is

363
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,280
<10-10,Penny>他们觉得自己聪明到冒烟了
<10-10,Penny>they think they're so smart they don't care

364
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,940
<10-10,Penny>根本不在乎会伤到别人的感情
<10-10,Penny>if they hurt other people's feelings.

365
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,200
<10-11,Amy>-好像是这么回事  -完全不是这么回事
<10-11,Amy>- Sounds like us. - That's not true.

366
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,950
<10-12,Sheldon>我还是没理解你们为什么生气
<10-12,Sheldon>I still don't understand why you're upset.

367
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,950
<10-12,Sheldon>你们每道题都解的比黑猩猩快
<10-12,Sheldon>You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.

368
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,110
<10-13,Amy>除了比巴纳巴斯慢  但他吃着药呢
<10-13,Amy>Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.

369
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,770
<10-14,Howard>对不起  可是逼得我快疯了
<10-14,Howard>I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.

370
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,930
<10-15,Bernadette>你能不能就这么算了吧
<10-15,Bernadette>Can you please just let it go?

371
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,220
<10-16,Sheldon>这事我能帮忙
<10-16,Sheldon>Oh, I can help you with that.

372
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,700
<10-16,Sheldon>想象你手里握着一支普通的笔
<10-16,Sheldon>Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen.

373
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,750
<10-16,Sheldon>而你最喜欢地笔好好的放在口袋里
<10-16,Sheldon>While your favorite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.

374
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,970
<10-17,Howard>等会再说
<10-17,Howard>Hold that thought.

375
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,820
<10-17,Howard>你好
<10-17,Howard>Hello?

376
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,960
<10-18,Amy>要怎么才能弥补
<10-18,Amy>How can I make this up to you?

377
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,070
<10-19,Penny>答案就在这个机关盒里
<10-19,Penny>The answer's in this puzzle box.

378
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,650
<10-19,Penny>看看你能不能打开它呢
<10-19,Penny>Let's see if you can open it.

379
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,420
<10-20,Stuart>你就不能先提醒他一下家具的事吗
<10-20,Stuart>You could have at least warned him about the furniture.

380
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,450
<10-21,Raj>我们搬的时候  我就是这么说的
<10-21,Raj>That's what I said when we moved it.

381
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,890
<10-22,Bernadette>你还帮着搬了
<10-22,Bernadette>You helped him?!

382
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,360
<10-23,Raj>没有  抱枕都是斯图尔特自己搬的哦
<10-23,Raj>No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.

383
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,010
<10-24,Leonard>你没事吧
<10-24,Leonard>Hey, you okay?

384
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,830
<10-25,Howard>有事
<10-25,Howard>Uh, no.

385
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,060
<10-26,Leonard>怎么了
<10-26,Leonard>What's wrong?

386
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,250
<10-27,Howard>我母亲去世了
<10-27,Howard>My mom died.

388
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,840
<10-28,Bernadette>什么

389
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,460
<10-29,Howard>是我姨妈打来的
<10-29,Howard>That was my aunt.

390
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,580
<10-29,Howard>妈妈小睡了一会
<10-29,Howard>Ma took a nap.

391
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,620
<10-29,Howard>但她再也没醒过来
<10-29,Howard>She never woke up.

<10-30,Bernadette>天啊  华仔
<10-30,Bernadette>Oh, my God, Howie.

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,700
<10-31,Leonard>节哀
<10-31,Leonard>I'm so sorry.

00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,220
<10-32,Raj>我们能帮上什么吗
<10-32,Raj>What can we do?

395
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,770
<10-33,Howard>不知道
<10-33,Howard>I don't know.

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,890
<10-34,Sheldon>我能说句话吗
<10-34,Sheldon>May I say something?

397
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,220
<10-35,Leonard>时机不对  谢尔顿
<10-35,Leonard>Not right now, Sheldon.

398
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,820
<10-36,Sheldon>-但我觉得可以安慰到他  -兄弟
<10-36,Sheldon>- But I think it would be comforting. - Buddy...

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,760
<10-38,Howard>不  没事的
<10-38,Howard>No, it's okay.

400
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,910
<10-38,Howard>你想说什么
<10-38,Howard>What?

401
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,950
<10-39,Sheldon>当我的父亲去世时
<10-39,Sheldon>When I lost my own father,

402
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,710
<10-39,Sheldon>我没有任何朋友陪我渡过那段时间
<10-39,Sheldon>I didn't have any friends to help me through it.

403
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,580
<10-39,Sheldon>而你有
<10-39,Sheldon>You do.

404
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,100
<10-40,Penny>我真以为他会说"算了吧"
<10-40,Penny>I really thought he was gonna say, "let it go."

405
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,860
<11-1,Raj (on phone)>谢谢  伯纳黛特
<11-1,Raj (on phone)>Okay, thanks, Bernadette.

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,530
<11-2,Penny>霍华德状态怎么样
<11-2,Penny>How's Howard holding up?

411
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,010
<11-3,Raj>他还撑得住
<11-3,Raj>He's hanging in there.

412
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,500
<11-4,Leonard>你还好吗  斯图尔特
<11-4,Leonard>How are you doing, Stuart?

413
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,790
<11-5,Stuart>还是不敢相信她居然走了
<11-5,Stuart>Still can't believe she's gone.

414
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,550
<11-5,Stuart>是这个女人收留了我
<11-5,Stuart>I mean, that woman took me in.

415
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,580
<11-5,Stuart>如果没有她  我可能要露宿街头了
<11-5,Stuart>If it wasn't for her, I-I would have been homeless.

416
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,420
<11-6,Amy>我们中也肯定有人会收留你的
<11-6,Amy>One of us would have taken you in.

417
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,070
<11-7,Stuart>是吗  我怎么没想起来有谁说过
<11-7,Stuart>Yeah, I don't recall any offers.

418
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,090
<11-7,Stuart>但这样也挺好  我很高兴最后是她收留了我
<11-7,Stuart>But, you know, uh, I-I'm glad it worked out the way it did

419
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,480
<11-7,Stuart>因为我由此认识了一位善良的人
<11-7,Stuart>because I got to know this wonderful person.

420
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,880
<11-7,Stuart>是啊
<11-7,Stuart>Yeah.

421
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,060
<11-8,Raj>沃罗威茨夫人非常特别
<11-8,Raj>Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special.

422
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,010
<11-8,Raj>当我刚搬到美国
<11-8,Raj>When I first moved to America,

423
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,540
<11-8,Raj>那时霍华德是我唯一的朋友
<11-8,Raj>Howard was my only friend.

424
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,780
<11-8,Raj>她让我在她家时宾至如归
<11-8,Raj>She made me feel so welcome in her home.

425
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,780
<11-8,Raj>不过事出有因  因为那几年
<11-8,Raj>Which says a lot, because, those first few years,

426
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,020
<11-8,Raj>她一直以为我是她家园丁
<11-8,Raj>she thought I was the gardener.

427
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,220
<11-9,Penny>她每次见到我
<11-9,Penny>Whenever I saw her,

428
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,230
<11-9,Penny>都说我太瘦了  使劲让我多吃
<11-9,Penny>she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.

429
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,810
<11-10,Amy>她也是这样对我的
<11-10,Amy>She did that to me, too.

430
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,480
<11-11,Penny>别抢走我对她的独家回忆
<11-11,Penny>Don't take this away from me.

431
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,050
<11-12,Sheldon>我不介意她的大吼大叫
<11-12,Sheldon>I didn't care for her yelling.

432
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,050
<11-12,Sheldon>但现在我再也听不到了
<11-12,Sheldon>But now that I'm not going to hear it again,

433
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,680
<11-12,Sheldon>真伤心
<11-12,Sheldon>I'm sad.

434
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,360
<11-13,Leonard>你要是乐意  之后我可以吼你
<11-13,Leonard>If you want, I can yell at you later.

435
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,260
<11-14,Sheldon>你吼不出她的霸气
<11-14,Sheldon>It won't be as good.

436
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,120
<11-15,Leonard>我们举杯
<11-15,Leonard>Let's have a toast.

437
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,260
<11-15,Leonard>敬沃罗威茨夫人
<11-15,Leonard>To Mrs. Wolowitz.

438
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,620
<11-15,Leonard>我们所有人亲爱的...
<11-15,Leonard>A loving mother...

439
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,540
<11-15,Leonard>母亲
<11-15,Leonard>...to all of us.

440
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,480
