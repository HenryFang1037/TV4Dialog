<1-25,Leonard>拍拍身上的土  忘记她向前看
<1-25,Leonard>Dust yourself off, forget it and move on.

<1-26,Stuart>我做不到

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,860
<2-20,Leonard>斯图尔特有压力才有动力
<2-20,Leonard>Stuart thrives under pressure.

131
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,100
<2-20,Leonard>所以他才会在漫画书店工作
<2-20,Leonard>That's why he works in a comic book store.

132
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,360
<3-1,Leonard>是斯图尔特
<3-1,Leonard>Oh, it's stuart.

133
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,860
<3-2,Sheldon>你不接么?
<3-2,Sheldon>You're not going to answer it?

134
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,630
<3-3,Leonard>他想谈佩妮的事
<3-3,Leonard>He wants to talk about penny.

135
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,030
<3-3,Leonard>而我不想
<3-3,Leonard>I don't want to talk about penny.

136
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,230
<3-4,Sheldon>你在做一个假设
<3-4,Sheldon>You're making an assumption.

137
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,960
<3-4,Sheldon>但万一是漫画店失火了呢
<3-4,Sheldon>Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.

138
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,530
<3-4,Sheldon>他需要你的帮助
<3-4,Sheldon>And he needs your assistance.

139
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,400
<3-5,Leonard>他怎么会打给我?
<3-5,Leonard>Why would he call me?

140
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,030
<3-6,Sheldon>我们不知道
<3-6,Sheldon>We don't know.

141
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,760
<3-6,Sheldon>我们没法知道  除非你接电话
<3-6,Sheldon>And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.

142
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,500
<3-7,Leonard>谢尔顿  我不会接的
<3-7,Leonard>I'm not answering the phone, sheldon.

143
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,660
<3-8,Sheldon>-接电话  莱纳德  -不
<3-8,Sheldon>- Answer the phone, leonard. - no!

144
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,200
<3-9,Leonard>好了  进到语音信箱里了
<3-9,Leonard>There, it went to voice mail.

145
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,830
<3-10,Sheldon>你不准备查语音信息么?
<3-10,Sheldon>Aren't you going to check your messages?

146
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,600
<3-10,Sheldon>不
<3-10,Sheldon>No.

147
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,560
<3-10,Sheldon>你一定要查查信息  莱纳德
<3-10,Sheldon>You have to check your messages, leonard!

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,900
<3-11,Leonard>留语音信息
<3-11,Leonard>The in a

149
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,660
<3-12,Sheldon>是社会契约的一半
<3-12,Sheldon>Is one half of a social contract

150
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,400
<3-12,Sheldon>而另一半要由查信息来完成
<3-12,Sheldon>Which is completed by the checking of the message.

151
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,860
<3-12,Sheldon>如果这个契约被打破了
<3-12,Sheldon>If that contract breaks down,

152
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,900
<3-12,Sheldon>整个社会的契约就都坍塌了
<3-12,Sheldon>Then all social contracts break down

153
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,260
<3-12,Sheldon>而我们就堕落到无政府状态
<3-12,Sheldon>And we descend into anarchy.

154
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,760
<3-13,Leonard>你脑袋里肯定是一片狼藉
<3-13,Leonard>It must be hell inside your head.

155
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,660
<3-14,Sheldon>偶尔会这样
<3-14,Sheldon>At times.

156
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,760
<3-15,Howard>哥几个  红色警戒
<3-15,Howard>Guys, we have a code red.

157
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,730
<3-16,Sheldon>你是指医院的紧急警报
<3-16,Sheldon>You mean "code red" the hospital emergency alert,

158
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,660
<3-16,Sheldon>还是蠕虫病毒
<3-16,Sheldon>"code red" the computer worm, or "code red" the cherry-flavored

159
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,100
<3-16,Sheldon>还是百事出品的樱桃味汽水?
<3-16,Sheldon>Soft drink from the makers of mountain dew?

160
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
<3-17,Howard>我检查零重力马桶的图纸时
<3-17,Howard>Look, I was going over the schematics

161
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,200
<3-17,Howard>在转向阀的说明里
<3-17,Howard>On my zero-g toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake

162
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,900
<3-17,Howard>我发现了一个小小小小的错误
<3-17,Howard>On the specifications for the diverter valve.

163
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,930
<3-18,Leonard>有多小?
<3-18,Leonard>How teeny tiny?

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
<3-19,Howard>大概冲了十次以后就该坏了
<3-19,Howard>It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.

165
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,760
<3-20,Sheldon>但任务要持续六个月呢
<3-20,Sheldon>But the mission is for six months.

166
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,960
<3-20,Sheldon>说的就是这个红色警戒
<3-20,Sheldon>Yeah, see, that's the code red.

167
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,630
<3-21,Howard>这就像魔术箱
<3-21,Howard>It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.

168
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,800
<3-21,Howard>没人知道什么时候  但总会在某个时候
<3-21,Howard>No one knows exactly when, but at some point

169
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,560
<3-21,Howard>有些比木偶更恶的东西 会从那个盒子里跳出来
<3-21,Howard>Something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.

170
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,300
<3-22,Sheldon>你通知航天局了么?
<3-22,Sheldon>Have you notified nasa?

171
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,000
<3-23,Howard>你疯了?  我该怎么说?
<3-23,Howard>No, are you crazy? what am I gonna say?

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,610
<3-23,Howard>我搞砸了你们的马桶
<3-23,Howard>"i screwed up your toilet and pretty soon

173
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,810
<3-23,Howard>不久之后
<3-23,Howard>"there's gonna be crap floating

174
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,240
<3-23,Howard>你们整洁的太空站里将漂满大便?
<3-23,Howard>All over your nice shiny space station"?

175
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,840
<3-24,Leonard>那你准备怎么做?
<3-24,Leonard>So, what are you gonna do?

176
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,840
<3-25,Howard>我先想出怎么修理  然后再告诉他们
<3-25,Howard>I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.

177
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,840
<3-26,Leonard>那要我们做什么
<3-26,Leonard>So, what do you need us for?

178
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,140
<3-27,Raj>他想不出来怎么修理
<3-27,Raj>He can't figure out how to fix it.

179
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,410
<3-28,Howard>你说过你会支持我的
<3-28,Howard>Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.

180
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,840
<3-29,Raj>我努力着呢
<3-29,Raj>I'm trying,

181
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,210
<3-29,Raj>但你得承认这实在太搞笑了
<3-29,Raj>but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.

182
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,610
<3-30,Sheldon>我同意
<3-30,Sheldon>I agree.

183
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,540
<3-30,Sheldon>宇宙探索的高科技性
<3-30,Sheldon>It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature

184
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,570
<3-30,Sheldon>与马桶事故的平凡 进行的对比
<3-30,Sheldon>Of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet

185
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,210
<3-30,Sheldon>在这里提供了笑点
<3-30,Sheldon>That provides the comic fodder here.

186
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,940
<3-30,Sheldon>快查你的信息
<3-30,Sheldon>Check your messages.

187
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,350
<4-1,Howard>好了  这是和国际空间站
<4-1,Howard>All right, this is an exact duplicate

188
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,620
<4-2,Raj>配备的沃罗威茨零重力废物处理系统
<4-2,Raj>Of the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste disposal system

189
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,620
<4-1,Howard>一模一样的副本
<4-1,Howard>As deployed on the international space station.

190
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,080
<4-2,Raj>你说的是沃罗威茨零重力 人类排泄物"散布"系统吧
<4-2,Raj>Don't you mean the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste distribution system?

191
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,980
<4-3,Leonard>好样的
<4-3,Leonard>Good one.

192
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,250
<4-5,Howard>真好笑
<4-5,Howard>Yeah, it's hilarious.

193
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,850
<4-5,Howard>现在
<4-5,Howard>Now...

194
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,780
<4-5,Howard>这些是太空站中
<4-5,Howard>Here's an approximation of the spare parts

195
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,450
<4-5,Howard>大概有的备用零件
<4-5,Howard>Available on the space station.

196
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
<4-5,Howard>我们要想个方法  只用这些零件
<4-5,Howard>We gotta find a way, using nothing but this,

197
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,180
<4-5,Howard>来加固这个
<4-5,Howard>To reinforce this so the waste material

198
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,520
<4-5,Howard>避免堵住旋转涡轮
<4-5,Howard>Avoids the spinning turbine.

199
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,080
<4-6,Raj>你是说不要打中风扇?[酿成大祸]
<4-6,Raj>You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?

200
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,780
<4-7,Sheldon>我不得不说
<4-7,Sheldon>Yeah, I have to say,

201
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,020
<4-7,Sheldon>我以为重复说马桶笑话会变得无聊
<4-7,Sheldon>I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.

202
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,780
<4-7,Sheldon>显然  用太空便便
<4-7,Sheldon>Apparently, there is no law

203
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,480
<4-7,Sheldon>做笑点完全无懈可击呢
<4-7,Sheldon>Of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.

204
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,920
<4-9,Leonard>-你好  莱纳德  -好啊  斯图尔特
<4-9,Leonard>- Hey, leonard. - hey, stuart.

205
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,520
<4-10,Stuart>-你在忙吗  -呃...
<4-10,Stuart>- You busy? - um...

206
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,580
<4-12,Howard>这是机密  莱纳德
<4-12,Howard>Classified, leonard.

207
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,550
<4-13,Leonard>不过是项常规曼哈顿工程罢了
<4-13,Leonard>Yeah, it's a regular manhattan project.

208
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,720
<6-2,Penny>啥事
<6-2,Penny>What's up?

209
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,920
<4-13,Leonard>我今晚要和佩妮约会
<4-13,Leonard>Well, tonight's my date with penny

210
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,880
<4-14,Stuart>鉴于我们没法通电话
<4-14,Stuart>And since we haven't been able to connect by phone...

211
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,420
<4-15,Leonard>真是抱歉  手机坏了
<4-15,Leonard>Yeah, I'm sorry, it's been broken.

212
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,280
<4-16,Stuart>-电邮也不行  -那也坏了
<4-16,Stuart>- Or e-mail. - yeah, that's broken, too.

213
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,350
<4-17,Leonard>能坏的都坏了
<4-17,Leonard>Everything's broken.

214
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,920
<4-18,Stuart>最后时刻  希望你能给我点建议
<4-18,Stuart>Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.

215
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,850
<4-19,Leonard>好吧  正好灵光一现
<4-19,Leonard>Uh, all right, well, off the top of my head,

216
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,620
<4-19,Leonard>和佩妮一起时  最关键的
<4-19,Leonard>You know, I think the most important thing with penny

217
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,150
<4-19,Leonard>就是要慢慢来
<4-19,Leonard>Is to go really slow.

218
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,020
<4-19,Leonard>相当慢那种
<4-19,Leonard>I mean, glacial.

219
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,320
<4-20,Stuart>好吧
<4-20,Stuart>Okay.

220
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,520
<4-21,Leonard>她平时总是被男人围着
<4-21,Leonard>You know, guys come onto her all the time,

221
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,150
<4-21,Leonard>所以  你得矜持一点
<4-21,Leonard>So, you need to set yourself apart.

222
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,950
<4-21,Leonard>羞涩一点
<4-21,Leonard>You know, be a little shy,

223
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,820
<4-21,Leonard>少点眼神交流
<4-21,Leonard>Don't make too much eye contact.

224
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,620
<4-21,Leonard>和她保持一种冷酷的疏离感
<4-21,Leonard>And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment

225
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,980
<4-21,Leonard>说白了就是畏惧感
<4-21,Leonard>And-and, you know, fear.

226
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,820
<4-22,Stuart>畏惧?
<4-22,Stuart>Fear?

227
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,320
<4-23,Leonard>对  就像
<4-23,Leonard>Yeah, like, uh,

228
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,680
<4-23,Leonard>你生怕一碰她就碎
<4-23,Leonard>You're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.

229
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,050
<4-24,Stuart>这个我很拿手呢
<4-24,Stuart>Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.

230
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,950
<4-24,Stuart>很好
<4-24,Stuart>Good, good.

231
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,520
<4-25,Leonard>今晚玩儿得开心点
<4-25,Leonard>Well, uh, you-you kids have fun tonight.

232
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,280
<4-26,Stuart>-多谢  莱纳德  -客气啥
<4-26,Stuart>- Thanks, leonard. - uh-huh.

233
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,980
<4-26,Stuart>那个到底是啥玩意儿
<4-26,Stuart>What is that thing anyway?

234
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,520
<4-27,Howard>你不知道吗
<4-27,Howard>You don't know what this is?

235
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,720
<4-29,Howard>-不知道  -很好  滚
<4-29,Howard>- No. - good. get out.

236
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,280
<4-30,Raj>害怕佩妮
<4-30,Raj>Be afraid of penny.

237
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,920
<4-30,Raj>很狡猾嘛
<4-30,Raj>Nice. very crafty.

238
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,920
<4-31,Leonard>这又不是馊主意
<4-31,Leonard>It wasn't bad advice.

239
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,150
<4-31,Leonard>只是不太管用罢了
<4-31,Leonard>It's just wasn't particularly helpful.

240
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,150
<4-32,Sheldon>不管怎样  俺娘常说  为一己私欲
<4-32,Sheldon>For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive

241
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,890
<4-32,Sheldon>而欺骗他人  会遭报应的
<4-32,Sheldon>for personal gain, we make jesue cry.

242
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,620
<5-1,Sheldon>好了  何不用这个2英寸PVC管
<5-1,Sheldon>All right, what if we use this two-inch pvc

243
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,180
<5-1,Sheldon>加固中间的交叉支撑呢?
<5-1,Sheldon>To reinforce the center cross-support?

244
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,580
<5-1,Sheldon>不行
<5-1,Sheldon>No good.

245
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,320
<5-2,Howard>对日本人和美国人或许有用
<5-2,Howard>I mean, it might work for the japanese

246
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,350
<5-2,Howard>你要知道太空舱里的
<5-2,Howard>And the americans, but have you seen the size

247
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,350
<5-2,Howard>俄罗斯人什么体型
<5-2,Howard>Of the russians they got up there?

248
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,120
<5-2,Howard>这东西得撑得起
<5-2,Howard>This thing has to hold up

249
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,880
<5-2,Howard>一群狂吃马铃薯的家伙
<5-2,Howard>Against a hearty potato-based diet.

250
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,220
<5-3,Leonard>我感觉很难过
<5-3,Leonard>I feel terrible.

251
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,620
<5-4,Howard>过来帮帮忙就不会难过了
<5-4,Howard>Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.

252
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,220
<5-5,Leonard>我故意破坏斯图尔特和佩妮的约会
<5-5,Leonard>I deliberately tried to sabotage stuart's date with penny.

253
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
<5-6,Raj>不难过才怪
<5-6,Raj>Of course you feel terrible.

254
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,950
<5-6,Raj>你完全搞砸了自己的"业"[印度教]
<5-6,Raj>You completely screwed up your karma, dude.

255
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,820
<5-7,Sheldon>你不会这么迷信吧
<5-7,Sheldon>You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,150
<5-8,Raj>这不是迷信
<5-8,Raj>It's not superstition.

257
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,750
<5-8,Raj>这跟牛顿学说差不多
<5-8,Raj>It's practically newtonian.

258
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,020
<5-8,Raj>任何作用力
<5-8,Raj>For every action,

259
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,750
<5-8,Raj>都会产生相等的反作用力
<5-8,Raj>There's an equal and opposite reaction.

260
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,420
<5-8,Raj>莱纳德表面像朋友
<5-8,Raj>Leonard pretends to be a friend

261
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,850
<5-8,Raj>实际行为却像个两面派婊子
<5-8,Raj>And acts like a two-faced bitch.

262
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,880
<5-8,Raj>因此  他会转世变成香蕉虫
<5-8,Raj>Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.

263
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,050
<5-8,Raj>其实是个完美的体系
<5-8,Raj>It's actually a very elegant system.

264
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,580
<5-9,Howard>这就是因果循环
<5-9,Howard>You know, what goes around comes around.

265
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,180
<5-9,Howard>说到循环
<5-9,Howard>Speaking of what goes around comes around...

266
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,180
<5-10,Raj>好吧
<5-10,Raj>Okay, look.

267
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,520
<5-10,Raj>与其加强这里的结构
<5-10,Raj>Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here,

268
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,550
<5-10,Raj>何不干脆另建一个通道来疏通呢
<5-10,Raj>What if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?

269
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,250
<5-11,Sheldon>行不通  管道直径不够
<5-11,Sheldon>It won't work. the diameter of the tubing is insufficient.

270
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,280
<5-12,Raj>那重置收集槽呢
<5-12,Raj>What if we reposition the collection tank?

271
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,020
<5-13,Sheldon>行不通  没地儿放
<5-13,Sheldon>It won't work. no way to mount it.

272
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,180
<5-14,Howard>我有个主意
<5-14,Howard>Okay, here's an idea.

273
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,780
<5-14,Howard>我干脆从此隐姓埋名
<5-14,Howard>What if I change my name and go live

274
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,350
<5-14,Howard>投靠以色列的堂姐艾薇和她老公
<5-14,Howard>With my cousin and her husband, avi, in israel?

275
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,050
<5-15,Sheldon>这个行得通
<5-15,Sheldon>That could work.

276
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,000
<6-2,Penny>-早安  -早安  怎么了
<6-2,Penny>- Morning. morning. - what's up?

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,840
<6-3,Leonard>没什么  我们熬了一夜
<6-3,Leonard>Nothing. we just pulled an all-nighter

278
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,100
<6-3,Leonard>修理一台零重力...意粉机
<6-3,Leonard>Trying to fix a zero-gravity... pasta maker.

279
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,840
<6-3,Leonard>我出去买点咖啡  你要吗
<6-3,Leonard>I'm going to make a coffee run. do you want any?

280
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,400
<6-4,Penny>不  谢了  我有
<6-4,Penny>Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.

281
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,970
<6-5,Leonard>很好  那昨晚的约会进展如何
<6-5,Leonard>Great. so how'd it go with stuart last night?

282
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,400
<6-6,Penny>我实在不想谈
<6-6,Penny>Um, I really don't want to talk about it.

283
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,640
<6-7,Leonard>当然可以
<6-7,Leonard>Yeah. right. sure.

284
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,870
<6-7,Leonard>不过  你们出去之前
<6-7,Leonard>The thing is, uh, before you guys went out,

285
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,300
<6-7,Leonard>我和他谈过  我...
<6-7,Leonard>I spoke to him and i...

286
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,840
<6-8,Penny>我说了  我不想谈
<6-8,Penny>I said I don't want to talk about it.

287
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,070
<6-9,Leonard>-我只是觉得...  -莱纳德
<6-9,Leonard>- Okay, I just, I kind of feel... - look, leonard,

288
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,070
<6-10,Penny>我和斯图尔特之间的事和你无关
<6-10,Penny>What goes on between me and stuart is none of your business.

289
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,720
<6-10,Penny>别管闲事了  行吧
<6-10,Penny>So just leave it alone, okay?

290
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,170
<6-11,Raj>你如果真想赎罪
<6-11,Raj>If you really want to clean up your karma,

291
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,100
<6-11,Raj>就快去帮我买拿铁
<6-11,Raj>Go get my freakin' latte.

292
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,770
<7-1,Howard>等下  我想到了
<7-1,Howard>Hang on, I think I've got this.

293
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,400
<7-1,Howard>帮我把这一小片PVC塑料
<7-1,Howard>Help me see if we can wedge this little piece

294
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,000
<7-1,Howard>塞进支撑杆后面
<7-1,Howard>Of pvc behind the support rod.

295
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,500
<7-2,Sheldon>你高估自己建的
<7-2,Sheldon>I think you're overestimating the tensile strength

296
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,840
<7-2,Sheldon>玩意的抗张强度了吧
<7-2,Sheldon>Of the substructure you're building.

297
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,700
<7-3,Howard>谢尔顿  我自有分寸
<7-3,Howard>Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.

298
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,770
<7-4,Sheldon>你要是有分寸  这里就不会放着太空马桶
<7-4,Sheldon>If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be

299
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,770
<7-4,Sheldon>而是放着我的咖啡桌
<7-4,Sheldon>A space toilet where my coffee table should be.

300
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,400
<7-5,Raj>霍华德  等等
<7-5,Raj>Howard,wait...

301
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,970
<7-5,Raj>为什么不用这个代替PVC管
<7-5,Raj>Why don't you ou use this instead of the pvc

302
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,070
<7-5,Raj>来辅助横向滤波器安装到位呢
<7-5,Raj>To keep the transverse filter assembly in place?

303
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,170
<7-6,Howard>因为这个东东不是空间站的零件
<7-6,Howard>Because this is not a spare part from the space station.

304
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,340
<7-6,Howard>这是比萨饼盒子里
<7-6,Howard>This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps

305
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
<7-6,Howard>用来避免盒盖接触起司的
<7-6,Howard>The lid from touching the cheese.

306
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,300
<7-7,Raj>就是这个用途吗
<7-7,Raj>That what that's for?

307
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,870
<7-7,Raj>在印度  盒盖就盖在起司上面
<7-7,Raj>In india, the lid just touches the cheese.

308
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,670
<7-7,Raj>当然了  我们还有极度的贫穷
<7-7,Raj>Of course, we also have rampant

309
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,970
<7-7,Raj>和周期性肆虐的霍乱
<7-7,Raj>Poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera,

310
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,570
<7-7,Raj>所以起司里有个小纸板也没啥大不了的
<7-7,Raj>So a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.

311
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,470
<7-8,Howard>-你去哪儿  -漫画书店
<7-8,Howard>- Where are you going? - comic book store.

312
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,200
<7-10,Sheldon>好主意呀  我可以借机休息
<7-10,Sheldon>Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.

313
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,370
<7-11,Raj>-我也是  -等等
<7-11,Raj>- Me, too.- Now, hold on.

314
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,540
<7-12,Howard>只要航天员能安全地在太空中大便
<7-12,Howard>You guys can go to the comic book store

315
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,970
<7-12,Howard>我就让你们去漫画书店
<7-12,Howard>When man can once again safely poop in space.

316
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,470
<7-13,Sheldon>为什么莱纳德可以去
<7-13,Sheldon>Why does Leonard get to go?

317
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,700
<7-14,Leonard>因为他跟佩妮的关系现在纠缠不清
<7-14,Leonard>'cause he's upset over his situation with penny

318
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,270
<7-14,Leonard>要是再让我听到一次
<7-14,Leonard>And if I have to hear about it again,

319
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,800
<7-14,Leonard>我就把他卵巢那个地方踢飞
<7-14,Leonard>I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.

320
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,470
<7-15,Leonard>霍华德  谢谢你的理解
<7-15,Leonard>Thanks for understanding, howard.

321
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,300
<7-16,Howard>姐妹  我支持你
<7-16,Howard>I got your back, sister.

322
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,900
<7-16,Howard>好啦  我觉得这台
<7-16,Howard>All right, I think we've got

323
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,670
<7-16,Howard>原型机可以开始接受测试了
<7-16,Howard>A prototype ready to test.

324
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,870
<7-16,Howard>把那个特百惠盒子递给我
<7-16,Howard>Hand me that Tupperware.

325
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,640
<7-17,Raj>哇  真重啊
<7-17,Raj>Wow, that's heavy.

326
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,500
<7-18,Howard>当然重  是我妈妈做的肉馅糕
<7-18,Howard>Damn right it's heavy. it's my mother's meat loaf.

327
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,040
<7-18,Howard>已经用它测试了无数次马桶了
<7-18,Howard>It's been testing toilets for generations.

328
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,700
<7-19,Sheldon>我必须指出  霍华德  如果给麻省理工写封信
<7-19,Sheldon>I must say, howard, I think a detailed letter to mit

329
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,170
<7-19,Sheldon>描述你目前状况  可能会让他们
<7-19,Sheldon>Describing your current circumstances might entitle you

330
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,700
<7-19,Sheldon>退回你的硕士学位
<7-19,Sheldon>To a refund on your master's degree.

331
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,100
<7-20,Howard>好的  模拟零重力环境人类排泄物处理测试
<7-20,Howard>Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test

332
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,440
<7-20,Howard>肉馅糕模拟物已就绪
<7-20,Howard>With meat loaf analog in...

333
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,040
<7-20,Howard>三  二  一
<7-20,Howard>Three, two, one.

334
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,800
<7-21,Sheldon>很好很强大
<7-21,Sheldon>Fascinating.

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,570
<7-22,Raj>你觉得问题出在哪
<7-22,Raj>What do you think the problem is?

336
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,870
<7-23,Howard>面包屑放得不够
<7-23,Howard>Not enough bread crumbs.

337
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,970
<8-1,Leonard>-斯图尔特  我想跟你谈谈  -当然  怎么了
<8-1,Leonard>- Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you. - Sure, what's up?

338
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,070
<8-3,Leonard>关于佩妮  我觉得我给了你一些很坏的建议
<8-3,Leonard>I think I gave you some bad advice about penny,

339
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,440
<8-3,Leonard>我想道歉
<8-3,Leonard>And I want to apologize.

340
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,840
<8-4,Stuart>别啊  你的建议挺不错的
<8-4,Stuart>Oh, no, your advice was great.

341
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,040
<8-5,Leonard>真的
<8-5,Leonard>It was?

342
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,500
<8-6,Stuart>是啊  "慢慢来"确实管用
<8-6,Stuart>Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.

343
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,740
<8-7,Leonard>你开玩笑吧
<8-7,Leonard>You're kidding.

344
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,070
<8-7,Leonard>对我来说从来不管用
<8-7,Leonard>Never worked for me.

345
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,570
<8-8,Stuart>昨天吃晚饭的时候  我按照你说的做了
<8-8,Stuart>Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me.

346
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,540
<8-8,Stuart>我尽量慢慢来  并且保持距离
<8-8,Stuart>I went really slow, I kept my distance,

347
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,800
<8-8,Stuart>然后两瓶红酒下肚  我们就在车里亲热了
<8-8,Stuart>And two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,900
<8-9,Leonard>红酒  我没说要给她喝红酒啊
<8-9,Leonard>Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

349
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,200
<8-10,Stuart>没事  因为从那开始就出乱子了
<8-10,Stuart>It doesn't matter, 'cause that's where it all went to hell.

350
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,700
<8-11,Leonard>接吻的时候
<8-11,Leonard>During the kissing?

351
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,740
<8-11,Leonard>你做了什么  对着她的嘴打喷嚏么
<8-11,Leonard>What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?

352
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,100
<8-11,Leonard>我对一个女孩儿做过一次
<8-11,Leonard>I did that to a girl once.

353
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,870
<8-12,Stuart>没  一切正常  我俩也很投入
<8-12,Stuart>No, everything was good and really hot.

354
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,770
<8-12,Stuart>然后我说
<8-12,Stuart>And I said,

355
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,770
<8-12,Stuart>"噢  佩妮"  就在
<8-12,Stuart>"Oh, penny," and right where

356
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,070
<8-12,Stuart>她应该说"噢  斯图尔特"的时候  她却说了
<8-12,Stuart>She was supposed to say, "oh, Stuart," she said...

357
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,700
<8-14,Stuart>你的名字
<8-14,Stuart>Your name.

358
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,970
<8-13,Leonard>"莱纳德"吗
<8-13,Leonard>"Leonard"?

359
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,330
<8-14,Stuart>-那是你的名字吧  -是啊 不是 是
<8-14,Stuart>- That is your name, right? - yeah, no, yeah.

360
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,340
<8-15,Leonard>我很抱歉
<8-15,Leonard>Wow, I'm sorry.

361
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
<8-15,Leonard>你肯定不想听这样的话
<8-15,Leonard>That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.

362
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,670
<8-16,Stuart>跟"你知道我很花心"不相上下了
