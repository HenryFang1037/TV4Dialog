1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,830
<1-1,Leonard>我们要出门了  再见
<1-1,Leonard>Okay, we're headed out-- See you later.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,990
<1-2,Sheldon>你俩走之前
<1-2,Sheldon>Before you leave,

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,560
<1-2,Sheldon>能帮我测试一下这降噪耳机吗
<1-2,Sheldon>could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,820
<1-3,Leonard>好呀
<1-3,Leonard>Yeah, sure. Okay.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,710
<1-4,Sheldon>开始吧
<1-4,Sheldon>Go ahead.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,840
<1-5,Leonard>你好  能听见我说话吗
<1-5,Leonard>Hello, can you hear me?

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,130
<1-5,Leonard>谢尔顿  咱家水壶里的
<1-5,Leonard>Sheldon, I haven't changed the filter

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,780
<1-5,Leonard>滤水器已经两年没换过了
<1-5,Leonard>in the water pitcher in two years.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,610
<1-6,Penny>伯纳黛特给你取了个外号叫处子鸡尾酒
<1-6,Penny>Uh, Bernadette's nickname for you is the virgin pina colada.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,690
<1-7,Leonard>你收藏的乔治·卢卡斯签名其实是我的签名
<1-7,Leonard>Your George Lucas autograph is really a "me" autograph.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,100
<1-8,Penny>有一次我懒得走回我家去
<1-8,Penny>Yeah, well, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall,

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,390
<1-8,Penny>于是我借用了你的牙刷
<1-8,Penny>so I used your toothbrush.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,490
<1-9,Leonard>还有一次你睡着了
<1-9,Leonard>Ooh, and one time when you were asleep,

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,920
<1-9,Leonard>艾米脱掉了她的...
<1-9,Leonard>Amy totally took off her...

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,350
<1-9,Leonard>...所以你才是百里挑一的好室友
<1-9,Leonard>And that's why you're the best roommate ever.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,670
<1-10,Sheldon>真可惜我没听到这些好话
<1-10,Sheldon>Now I'm sad I didn't hear it.

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,150
<1-11,Penny>你拿这降噪耳机干嘛用呢
<1-11,Penny>So what do you need the headphones for?

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,730
<1-12,Sheldon>我这几个月一直在研究
<1-12,Sheldon>Well, I've been struggling for months

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,500
<1-12,Sheldon>暗物质中质子
<1-12,Sheldon>to come up with a theory of dark matter

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,230
<1-12,Sheldon>不衰变的问题
<1-12,Sheldon>that doesn't make protons decay.

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,780
<1-12,Sheldon>我希望能靠优化工作环境的办法
<1-12,Sheldon>I'm hoping to finally tackle it

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,890
<1-12,Sheldon>来解决这个问题
<1-12,Sheldon>by optimizing my work environment.

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,620
<1-12,Sheldon>所以我准备了最佳饮用温度的茶
<1-12,Sheldon>See, I've got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,080
<1-12,Sheldon>穿上了加绒的四角内裤
<1-12,Sheldon>Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,650
<1-12,Sheldon>保暖我的小屁屁
<1-12,Sheldon>to keep my tushie toasty.

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,740
<1-12,Sheldon>最后但也是同样重要的一点
<1-12,Sheldon>And then, oh, last but not least,

28
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,900
<1-12,Sheldon>这张激励人心的猫咪海报
<1-12,Sheldon>this inspirational cat poster,

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,130
<1-12,Sheldon>上面印着物理学界的叛徒
<1-12,Sheldon>improved with the reassuring face

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,470
<1-12,Sheldon>理查德·费曼和蔼可亲的脸
<1-12,Sheldon>of physics renegade Richard Feynman.

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,340
<1-13,Penny>这就是你昨晚带他去文具店的原因吗
<1-13,Penny>Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?

32
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,440
<1-14,Leonard>我不想聊这件事
<1-14,Leonard>I don't want to talk about it.

33
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,410
<1-14,Leonard>好了  这地盘归你了
<1-14,Leonard>There, the place is all yours.

34
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,260
<1-15,Penny>好好玩吧
<1-15,Penny>Yeah, have fun.

35
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,190
<1-16,Sheldon>我会的  没有比改变世界的
<1-16,Sheldon>Oh, I will-- nothing more fun

36
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,550
<1-16,Sheldon>科学之夜更让人开心的了
<1-16,Sheldon>than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,650
<1-17,Penny>你却说替我搓澡才是最开心的事
<1-17,Penny>And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.

38
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,700
<1-18,Leonard>拜拜
<1-18,Leonard>Bye.

39
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,960
<1-18,Leonard>好了
<1-18,Leonard>Okay.

40
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,980
<1-19,Sheldon>开始吧
<1-19,Sheldon>Here we go.

41
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,220
<1-19,Sheldon>质子衰变
<1-19,Sheldon>Proton decay.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,820
<1-19,Sheldon>质子衰变
<1-19,Sheldon>Proton decay.

43
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,410
<1-19,Sheldon>质子衰变
<1-19,Sheldon>Proton decay.

44
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,200
<1-19,Sheldon>质子衰变
<1-19,Sheldon>Proton decay.

45
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,340
<1-19,Sheldon>质子衰变
<1-19,Sheldon>Proton decay.

46
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,380
<1-19,Sheldon>质子衰变
<1-19,Sheldon>Proton decay.

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,830
<1-20,Leonard>我们回来了
<1-20,Leonard>Hey, we're home.

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,350
<1-20,Leonard>有什么进展吗
<1-20,Leonard>Any progress?

49
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,380
<1-21,Sheldon>怎么可能有进展
<1-21,Sheldon>How could there be?!

50
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,490
<1-21,Sheldon>你们老是打扰我
<1-21,Sheldon>With these constant interruptions.

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,020
<1-22,Penny>我爱他  但如果他坏掉了  我们别再买新的了
<1-22,Penny>I love him, but if he's broken, let's not get a new one.

58
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,100
<2-1,Leonard>你在干什么  该上班了
<2-1,Leonard>What are you doing? It's time to go.

59
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,060
<2-2,Sheldon>我今天不去上班
<2-2,Sheldon>I'm not going to work today.

60
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,140
<2-2,Sheldon>你想知道为什么吗
<2-2,Sheldon>And would you like to know why?

61
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,060
<2-3,Leonard>你不高兴  因为你花了一整晚
<2-3,Leonard>Ah, you're upset because you spent the whole night working

62
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,850
<2-3,Leonard>研究暗物质却找不到突破口
<2-3,Leonard>on dark matter and didn't make a breakthrough,

63
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,030
<2-3,Leonard>现在你担心转换研究方向的决定是错误的
<2-3,Leonard>and now you're worried you made a huge mistake switching fields,

64
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,920
<2-3,Leonard>于是你要窝在家里生一整天闷气
<2-3,Leonard>and you're gonna sit around and sulk all day?

65
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,370
<2-4,Sheldon>就像一个大宝宝
<2-4,Sheldon>Like a big old baby.

66
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,460
<2-5,Leonard>有需要给我打电话
<2-5,Leonard>Call me if you need anything.

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,710
<2-6,Sheldon>我在这里闷太久了
<2-6,Sheldon>I've been cooped up in here too long.

68
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,420
<2-6,Sheldon>也许我需要点新鲜空气
<2-6,Sheldon>Maybe I need some fresh air.

69
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,090
<2-8,Sheldon>佩妮
<2-8,Sheldon>Penny?

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,260
<2-8,Sheldon>佩妮
<2-8,Sheldon>Penny?

71
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,130
<2-8,Sheldon>佩妮
<2-8,Sheldon>Penny?

72
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,900
<2-10,Sheldon>什么事
<2-10,Sheldon>Ugh, what?

73
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,800
<2-12,Sheldon>听起来你很痛苦
<2-12,Sheldon>You sounded in distress.

74
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,410
<2-14,Sheldon>我担心你是不是遇到了麻烦
<2-14,Sheldon>I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you.

75
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,780
<2-14,Sheldon>比如有人要谋杀你
<2-14,Sheldon>Like a murder.

76
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,210
<2-14,Sheldon>或者是莱纳德突然找你滚床单
<2-14,Sheldon>Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,420
<2-15,Penny>我只是在锻炼  讨厌死了
<2-15,Penny>Oh, I'm just doing this awful workout. I hate it.

78
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,940
<2-16,Sheldon>如果你讨厌  干嘛还要做呢
<2-16,Sheldon>Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it?

79
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,240
<2-16,Sheldon>当然我对你和莱纳德滚床单这件事
<2-16,Sheldon>Although I could ask the same question

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,770
<2-16,Sheldon>也有同样的问题
<2-16,Sheldon>about coitus with Leonard.

81
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,000
<2-17,Penny>我想  我就是喜欢这种讨厌它的感觉吧
<2-17,Penny>I don't know-- I guess I like that I hate it.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,380
<2-17,Penny>可以激发我的斗志
<2-17,Penny>It makes me work harder.

83
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,150
<2-18,Sheldon>-你是指...  -我是指锻炼  谢尔顿
<2-18,Sheldon>- And to clarify... - The exercise, Sheldon.

84
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,640
<2-19,Penny>你不是应该准备上班了吗
<2-19,Penny>Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?

85
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,040
<2-20,Sheldon>我今天不上班
<2-20,Sheldon>I'm not going.

86
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,720
<2-20,Sheldon>你想知道为什么吗
<2-20,Sheldon>Would you like to know why?

87
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,550
<2-21,Penny>你不高兴  因为你昨晚什么都没搞出来
<2-21,Penny>Uh, you're sad about not getting anything done last night,

88
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,450
<2-21,Penny>所以你要窝在家里生一整天闷气
<2-21,Penny>so you're gonna sit around and pout about it?

89
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,180
<2-22,Sheldon>我完全不如自己预期的那么神秘莫测啊
<2-22,Sheldon>Boy, I'm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.

90
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,170
<3-1,Howard>-我发明了一个游戏  想玩吗  -好啊
<3-1,Howard>- I invented a game. You want to play? - Sure.

91
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,370
<3-2,Leonard>名字叫"艾米丽还是小桂子"
<3-2,Leonard>It's called "Emily or Cinnamon""

92
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,930
<3-3,Howard>我告诉你们拉杰曾经说过的话
<3-3,Howard>I give you actual quotes I've heard Raj say,

93
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,350
<3-3,Howard>你来猜一猜这些话的对象是女朋友  还是狗
<3-3,Howard>and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.

94
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,830
<3-4,Raj>好啊  你想笑就笑吧
<3-4,Raj>Go ahead, make fun.

95
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,010
<3-4,Raj>我可不会觉得尴尬
<3-4,Raj>You can't embarrass me.

96
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,510
<3-4,Raj>我有一个漂亮女友
<3-4,Raj>I've got a beautiful girlfriend

97
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,190
<3-4,Raj>和一条爱我爱到愿意喝我洗澡水的狗
<3-4,Raj>and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,600
<3-5,Howard>很好  这是对谁说的  艾米丽还是小桂子
<3-5,Howard>Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon:

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,840
<3-5,Howard>"你要知道  你不在的时候
<3-5,Howard>"I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely

100
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,240
<3-5,Howard>空荡荡的床显得好孤单"
<3-5,Howard>when you're not in it."

101
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,700
<3-6,Raj>我可不怎么喜欢这个游戏
<3-6,Raj>I may not be liking this game so much.

102
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,020
<3-7,Leonard>小桂子  再来一个
<3-7,Leonard>Cinnamon. Give me another one.

103
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,220
<3-8,Howard>好的  艾米丽还是小桂子
<3-8,Howard>Okay, Emily or Cinnamon:

104
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,690
<3-8,Howard>"看看  我给咱俩买了情侣毛衣"
<3-8,Howard>"Check it out, I got us matching sweaters!"

105
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,700
<3-9,Leonard>我们都收到了他的圣诞卡  当然是小桂子
<3-9,Leonard>We all got the Christmas card-- Cinnamon.

106
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,770
<3-10,Raj>一个男人可以同时关爱他的女人和他的狗
<3-10,Raj>You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet.

107
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,950
<3-10,Raj>这并不奇怪
<3-10,Raj>It's not strange.

108
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,850
<3-11,Leonard>艾米丽  这话我听过他对艾米丽说过
<3-11,Leonard>Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily.

109
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,370
<3-11,Leonard>你不是要待在家里吗
<3-11,Leonard>Hey, I thought you were staying home.

110
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,210
<3-12,Sheldon>是的  但和佩妮聊过之后
<3-12,Sheldon>Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny,

111
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,650
<3-12,Sheldon>我发现了一件事
<3-12,Sheldon>I realized something.

112
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,480
<3-12,Sheldon>我...首先  她为了保持对你的吸引力
<3-12,Sheldon>I... first, she's trying much harder to stay attractive

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,280
<3-12,Sheldon>付出的努力可比你多
<3-12,Sheldon>in this relationship than you are.

114
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,920
<3-12,Sheldon>其次
<3-12,Sheldon>And second...

115
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,060
<3-12,Sheldon>我毫无进展的原因就是
<3-12,Sheldon>the reason I may not be progressing in my research is

116
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,410
<3-12,Sheldon>我为自己打造的环境太舒适了
<3-12,Sheldon>I've created too pleasant of an environment for myself.

117
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,900
<3-13,Howard>什么意思
<3-13,Howard>What do you mean?

118
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,580
<3-14,Sheldon>根据叶杜二氏的心理学实验
<3-14,Sheldon>According to a classic psychological experiment

119
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,060
<3-14,Sheldon>想提高工作效率
<3-14,Sheldon>by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance,

120
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,290
<3-14,Sheldon>就必须营造一种焦虑紧张的气氛
<3-14,Sheldon>one must create a state of productive anxiety.

121
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,770
<3-14,Sheldon>所以我希望你们能帮我个忙
<3-14,Sheldon>So I'd like to ask you all to do something for me.

122
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,760
<3-14,Sheldon>别让我放松下来
<3-14,Sheldon>Keep me on my toes.

123
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,810
<3-14,Sheldon>攻我不备
<3-14,Sheldon>Just throw me off my game.

124
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,210
<3-14,Sheldon>最重要的是  使劲浑身解数让我难受
<3-14,Sheldon>E-Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.

125
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,160
<3-15,Howard>等等
<3-15,Howard>Hold on.

126
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,870
<3-15,Howard>这么做对我们有什么好处
<3-15,Howard>What's in it for us?

127
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,020
<3-16,Sheldon>-我觉得吧..  -好  我们同意了
<3-16,Sheldon>- Well, I suppose... - Okay, we'll do it!

128
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,900
<4-1,Sheldon>做完了
<4-1,Sheldon>Done.

129
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,610
<4-2,Amy>33秒
<4-2,Amy>33 seconds.

130
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,030
<4-2,Amy>这就是我们的基准线
<4-2,Amy>Okay, that'll be our baseline.

131
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,070
<4-3,Sheldon>我不想教你怎么工作
<4-3,Sheldon>You know, I don't want to tell you how to do your job,

132
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,540
<4-3,Sheldon>不过如果一只老鼠走通了迷宫
<4-3,Sheldon>but when a mouse completes a maze,

133
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,440
<4-3,Sheldon>它会得到饲料奖励
<4-3,Sheldon>it gets a food pellet.

134
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,220
<4-4,Amy>它的大脑还会被镊子夹出来呢
<4-4,Amy>It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.

135
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,200
<4-5,Sheldon>而它的最后一餐只是一颗饲料
<4-5,Sheldon>And his last meal was a food pellet?

136
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,350
<4-5,Sheldon>你真是禽兽
<4-5,Sheldon>You're a monster.

137
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,540
<4-6,Amy>好了  接下来  我们要逐步
<4-6,Amy>All right, next, we're gonna introduce

138
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,570
<4-6,Amy>加强紧张焦虑刺激  测量你的应力水平
<4-6,Amy>an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels

139
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,410
<4-6,Amy>观察它对你思考能力的影响
<4-6,Amy>and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.

140
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,220
<4-7,Sheldon>很好
<4-7,Sheldon>Very well.

141
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,600
<4-7,Sheldon>祝你好运  人家可是个淡定哥哦
<4-7,Sheldon>And good luck-- I'm a pretty laid-back guy.

142
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,550
<4-8,Amy>准备好了吗
<4-8,Amy>Ready?

143
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,580
<4-8,Amy>开始
<4-8,Amy>Begin.

144
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,420
<4-8,Amy>你为什么要戳破
<4-8,Amy>Why'd you pop it?

145
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,600
<4-9,Sheldon>对不起  我本来瞄准的是你的心脏
<4-9,Sheldon>I'm sorry, I was aiming for your heart.

146
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,380
<4-10,Amy>我知道你不喜欢
<4-10,Amy>Look, I know you don't like it,

147
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,200
<4-10,Amy>但这是实验的意义所在
<4-10,Amy>but that's the point of the experiment.

148
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,490
<4-10,Amy>我需要激怒你
<4-10,Amy>I need to irritate you

149
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,710
<4-10,Amy>来找到你的最佳焦虑区
<4-10,Amy>to find your optimal anxiety zone.

150
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,810
<4-10,Amy>而且你不要挠痒痒  波尔卡舞曲或看我吃香蕉
<4-10,Amy>And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.

151
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
<4-11,Sheldon>谁会横着啃香蕉啊
<4-11,Sheldon>Who eats them horizontally?!

152
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,980
<4-12,Amy>我妈说好女孩都是这么吃的
<4-12,Amy>My mother said that's how good girls do it.

153
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,230
<4-13,Sheldon>也许这是浪费时间
<4-13,Sheldon>Perhaps this was a waste of time.

154
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,500
<4-13,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<4-13,Sheldon>Sheldon,

155
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,620
<4-14,Amy>你是了不起的科学家
<4-14,Amy>you're a remarkable scientist.

156
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,310
<4-14,Amy>耐心一点  我确信你会找到一直寻觅的
<4-14,Amy>Just be patient-- I'm sure you'll find the breakthrough

157
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,580
<4-14,Amy>突破口
<4-14,Amy>you've been looking for.

<4-15,Sheldon>谢谢
<4-15,Sheldon>Thank you.

159
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,750
<4-16,Amy>而且如果你只进行可靠研究
<4-16,Amy>And if you only do solid research

160
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,360
<4-16,Amy>而不是有开创性的发现
<4-16,Amy>instead of making a groundbreaking discovery,

161
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,310
<4-16,Amy>那又有什么关系呢
<4-16,Amy>what does it matter?

162
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,450
<4-16,Amy>只进行可靠研究
<4-16,Amy>"Only do solid research"?!

163
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,330
<4-17,Sheldon>我来找你帮忙  你却侮辱我
<4-17,Sheldon>Uh... I come to you for help, and you insult me?!

164
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,120
<4-17,Sheldon>我原以为你至少可以...
<4-17,Sheldon>I thought the least that you would do would be...

165
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,650
<4-18,Amy>看  你的焦虑水平达标了
<4-18,Amy>Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.

166
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,090
<4-18,Amy>真的吗
<4-18,Amy>Really?

167
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,730
<4-19,Sheldon>真是太好了
<4-19,Sheldon>Oh, that's fantastic.

168
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,130
<4-19,Sheldon>慢着  又落下去了
<4-19,Sheldon>N-Now, wait, they're dropping.

169
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,050
<4-19,Sheldon>为什么落下去了
<4-19,Sheldon>Why are they dropping?

170
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,790
<4-20,Amy>因为你开心数值提高了
<4-20,Amy>Because you're happy they're elevated.

171
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,770
<4-21,Sheldon>真是气死我了
<4-21,Sheldon>Oh, that is infuriating!

172
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,330
<4-21,Sheldon>看  又上升了
<4-21,Sheldon>Ooh, look, they went back up again.

173
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,110
<4-21,Sheldon>太好了
<4-21,Sheldon>Terrific.

174
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,760
<4-21,Sheldon>不好  又落下去了
<4-21,Sheldon>Oh, no, they went back down!

175
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,200
<5-1,Raj>各位  你们想玩什么游戏
<5-1,Raj>All right, guys, what game do you want to play?

176
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,690
<5-1,Raj>来看看
<5-1,Raj>Let's see.

177
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,610
<5-2,Howard>不如玩"艾米丽或小桂子"
<5-2,Howard>How about "Emily or Cinnamon""

178
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,010
<5-3,Raj>知道吗  你记得我说过的这些话
<5-3,Raj>You know what? I think it's a little weird

179
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,940
<5-3,Raj>感觉有点奇怪
<5-3,Raj>that you remember me saying all these things.

180
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,030
<5-3,Raj>也许真相是  你嫉妒我所拥有的这些关系
<5-3,Raj>Maybe the truth is-- you're jealous of all my relationships.

181
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,390
<5-4,Howard>也许我是嫉妒
<5-4,Howard>Oh, maybe I am.

182
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,060
<5-4,Howard>谁不想做这样的女孩
<5-4,Howard>Who wouldn't want to be the girl,

183
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,450
<5-4,Howard>也有可能是狗  听到以下的话
<5-4,Howard>or possibly dog, to hear the words:

184
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,750
<5-4,Howard>"你真幸运
<5-4,Howard>"You're so lucky.

185
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,070
<5-4,Howard>你有着最闪亮的头发[毛发]"
<5-4,Howard>You have the shiniest hair""

186
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,510
<5-5,Leonard>好难抉择
<5-5,Leonard>That is a tough one.

187
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,780
<5-5,Leonard>我知道他既帮女友梳发  也帮狗梳毛
<5-5,Leonard>Uh, I-I know he brushes both of them.

188
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,360
<5-5,Leonard>-先生们  -在
<5-5,Leonard>- Gentlemen... - Yeah.

189
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,070
<5-6,Sheldon>我想到了你们激怒我的最完美方法
<5-6,Sheldon>I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me.

190
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,790
<5-6,Sheldon>我想你们做我的智力拳击陪练
<5-6,Sheldon>I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners.

191
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,520
<5-6,Sheldon>从现在开始  我发表的任何言论
<5-6,Sheldon>From now on, when I make an assertion,

192
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,170
<5-6,Sheldon>你们都要提出质疑
<5-6,Sheldon>I need you to challenge it.

193
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,650
<5-7,Leonard>就是说  你说什么我们都反对吗
<5-7,Leonard>So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?

194
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,510
<5-8,Sheldon>是的
<5-8,Sheldon>Yes.

195
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,400
<5-9,Raj>-你觉得这样有帮助  -是的
<5-9,Raj>- And you think that's going to help? - Yes.

196
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,270
<5-11,Howard>我觉得这样做完全没帮助
<5-11,Howard>Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.

197
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
<5-12,Sheldon>不  会有的
<5-12,Sheldon>Oh, no, it will.

198
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,160
<5-12,Sheldon>我的大脑保持忙碌  我会更专心
<5-12,Sheldon>See, by keeping my mind engaged, I'll become more focused.

199
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,040
<5-13,Leonard>霍华德说得对  这招不会有用的
<5-13,Leonard>Howard's right-- that'll never work.

200
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,480
<5-14,Sheldon>别就管不管用反对我  这完全是有科学依据的
<5-14,Sheldon>Stop fighting me on the premise. It's scientifically valid.

201
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,220
<5-14,Sheldon>我会提出命题
<5-14,Sheldon>I'm going to advance propositions,

202
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,780
<5-14,Sheldon>我只是需要你们质疑我
<5-14,Sheldon>I just want you to challenge me.

203
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,360
<5-15,Raj>我觉得这完全不是你想要的
<5-15,Raj>I don't think that's what you want at all.

204
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,900
<5-16,Sheldon>这当然是我想要的
<5-16,Sheldon>Why, of course it's what I want.

205
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,990
<5-16,Sheldon>如果不是  我为什么会说这是我想要的
<5-16,Sheldon>Why would I say it's what I want if it's not what I want?

206
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,200
<5-17,Leonard>因为这是你想要的  却不是你所说的
<5-17,Leonard>Because it is what you want, and it's not what you said.

207
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,580
<5-18,Sheldon>我要求你们做这么简单的事  你们都做不到
<5-18,Sheldon>I ask you for one simple thing, and you can't even do it.

208
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,420
<5-19,Howard>我们可以
<5-19,Howard>Yes, we can.

209
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,100
<5-20,Sheldon>-那就照做  -就不
<5-20,Sheldon>- Yeah, well, then do it. - Nah.

210
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,320
<5-22,Sheldon>你们差劲死了
<5-22,Sheldon>You guys are the worst.

211
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,390
<5-22,Sheldon>谢谢  我想刚才有帮助
<5-22,Sheldon>Thank you, I think that was helpful.

<6-14,Sheldon>继续吧
<6-14,Sheldon>Continue.

246
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,060
<6-15,Penny>谢尔顿  我们只是普通人
<6-15,Penny>Sheldon, we are just people.

247
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,470
<6-15,Penny>我们聊的和你们男生聊的一样
<6-15,Penny>We talk about the same things you guys talk about.

248
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,710
<6-16,Sheldon>你们在聊狼人是否能游泳吗
<6-16,Sheldon>You talk about if werewolves can swim?

249
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,440
<6-16,Sheldon>莱纳德说可以
<6-16,Sheldon>See, Leonard says yes,

250
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,480
<6-16,Sheldon>但我说得看那人在被咬变身前
<6-16,Sheldon>but I say it depends on if the human could swim

251
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,340
<6-16,Sheldon>会不会游泳  你们说呢
<6-16,Sheldon>before he was bitten. What do you think?

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,850
<6-17,Penny>咱们来聊月经吧
<6-17,Penny>Let's just talk about our periods.

253
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,910
<6-18,Amy>慢着
<6-18,Amy>No, hold on.

254
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,900
<6-18,Amy>所有犬类天生就会游泳
<6-18,Amy>All canines instinctively know how to swim.

255
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,640
<6-18,Amy>为什么狼人不能拥有这种能力呢
<6-18,Amy>Why wouldn't a werewolf have the same abilities?

256
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,260
<6-19,Bernadette>他们不是百分百狼
<6-19,Bernadette>Well, they're not a hundred percent wolf.

257
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,040
<6-19,Bernadette>他们是狼人  只有部分是狼
<6-19,Bernadette>They're a werewolf-- that's only part wolf.

258
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
<6-19,Bernadette>就好比拿苹果和橙子作比较
<6-19,Bernadette>It's like comparing apples to oranges.

259
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,170
<6-19,Bernadette>谢谢
<6-19,Bernadette>Thank you.

260
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,350
<6-20,Sheldon>确切来说  是满月时  苹果变成了
<6-20,Sheldon>Oh, and technically, it's apples that turn into were-oranges

261
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,520
<6-20,Sheldon>狼橙子
<6-20,Sheldon>when the moon is full.

262
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,750
<6-20,Sheldon>真好玩
<6-20,Sheldon>Hey, this is fun.

263
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,450
<6-20,Sheldon>改天你们都没有经前综合症时我们再聊
<6-20,Sheldon>We should do it sometime when you aren't all PMS'ing.

264
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,150
<6-20,Sheldon>再见
<6-20,Sheldon>Bye.

265
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,460
<7-1,Leonard>出什么事了
<7-1,Leonard>What is going on?

266
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,090
<7-2,Sheldon>我要令焦虑保持在正确的水平
<7-2,Sheldon>Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level,

267
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,980
<7-2,Sheldon>所以我用黑武士  《蝙蝠侠》小丑以及哥斯拉的咆哮
<7-2,Sheldon>so I'm using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla's roar

268
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,660
<7-2,Sheldon>来令我保持在这一最佳状态
<7-2,Sheldon>to keep me in that sweet spot.

269
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,930
<7-2,Sheldon>我试着在里面加入泰勒·斯威夫特的歌
<7-2,Sheldon>Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix,

270
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,100
<7-2,Sheldon>结果发现我爱死她了
<7-2,Sheldon>but turns out I love her.

271
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,350
<7-3,Leonard>至少戴耳机听吧
<7-3,Leonard>Well, at least listen to it through headphones.

272
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,270
<7-3,Leonard>我还想睡觉呢  晚安
<7-3,Leonard>I'm trying to sleep. Good night.

273
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,560
<7-3,Leonard>瞧这脾气
<7-3,Leonard>Boy!

274
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,590
<7-4,Sheldon>泰勒没错  憎恨者就会黑  黑  黑你[歌词]
<7-4,Sheldon>Taylor was right-- haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

275
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,770
<8-1,Amy>最近你一直在工作
<8-1,Amy>You've been working so much lately,

276
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,090
<8-1,Amy>我很高兴你没有忘记约会之夜
<8-1,Amy>I'm glad you didn't forget about date night.

277
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,590
<8-2,Sheldon>当然了
<8-2,Sheldon>Of course.

278
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,680
<8-3,Amy>谢尔顿
<8-3,Amy>Sheldon.

279
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,760
<8-4,Sheldon>在
<8-4,Sheldon>Yeah.

280
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,680
<8-5,Amy>或许你想收起笔记本  跟我聊聊天
<8-5,Amy>Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.

281
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,330
<8-6,Sheldon>我可以双管齐下
<8-6,Sheldon>I can do both.

282
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,180
<8-6,Sheldon>我的大脑现在处于最佳工作状态
<8-6,Sheldon>No, my brain is working at optimal capacity.

283
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,220
<8-6,Sheldon>我可以一边与你进行交谈
<8-6,Sheldon>No, I can have a conversation with you

284
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,670
<8-6,Sheldon>同时一边解决暗物质质子衰变问题
<8-6,Sheldon>and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.

285
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,720
<8-7,Amy>好吧  你今天好吗
<8-7,Amy>Fine. How was your day?

286
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
<8-8,Sheldon>对  你说得对
<8-8,Sheldon>Oh, you said it.

287
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,760
<8-8,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<8-8,Sheldon>Sheldon.

288
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,890
<8-9,Amy>谢尔顿  我很担心你
<8-9,Amy>Sheldon, I'm worried about you.

289
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,270
<8-9,Amy>你不吃饭
<8-9,Amy>You're not eating,

290
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,340
<8-9,Amy>也几天都没睡觉了
<8-9,Amy>you haven't slept in days,

291
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,250
<8-9,Amy>而且说实话  那帽子已经开始发臭了
<8-9,Amy>and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.

292
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,450
<8-10,Sheldon>我知道
<8-10,Sheldon>I know.

293
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,600
<8-10,Sheldon>这酸爽取代了哥斯拉叫声
<8-10,Sheldon>It's replaced Godzilla

294
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,980
<8-10,Sheldon>成为了焦虑的主要来源
<8-10,Sheldon>as my principle source of anxiety.

295
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,440
<9-1,Howard>好  现在一票投艾米丽  一票投小桂子
<9-1,Howard>Okay, so it's one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon.

296
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,680
<9-1,Howard>佩妮  你这一票至关重要
<9-1,Howard>Penny, you're the tiebreaker.

297
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,830
<9-2,Penny>再念一遍原句
<9-2,Penny>Say the quote again.

298
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,530
<9-3,Howard>"太完美了  我们都是天秤座"
<9-3,Howard>"It's just so perfect that we're both Libras."

299
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,920
<9-4,Penny>太难选了
<9-4,Penny>Wow, this is hard.

300
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,590
<9-4,Penny>我要选小桂子
<9-4,Penny>I'm gonna say Cinnamon.

301
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,350
<9-5,Howard>-正确  -太棒了
<9-5,Howard>- Yes! - Yes!

302
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,610
<9-7,Raj>不是吧
<9-7,Raj>Come on!

303
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,120
<9-8,Howard>那是最后一题了  我保证
<9-8,Howard>That was the last one, I promise.

304
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,050
<9-8,Howard>以后不会玩了
<9-8,Howard>We won't play anymore.

305
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,160
<9-8,Howard>谢谢
<9-8,Howard>Thank you.

306
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,830
<9-9,Raj>如果被她发现了  会伤害她感情的
<9-9,Raj>'Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.

307
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
<9-10,Bernadette>艾米丽的感情吗
<9-10,Bernadette>Emily's feelings?

308
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,580
<9-11,Raj>对  艾米丽
<9-11,Raj>Yes, Emily.

309
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,330
<6-13,Bernadette>-准  -干的漂亮
<6-13,Bernadette>- Nice! Yay! - Good job!

310
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,200
<9-11,Raj>随便啦  谢尔顿呢
<9-11,Raj>Whatever. Where's Sheldon?

311
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,170
<9-12,Penny>约会之夜
<9-12,Penny>Date night.

312
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,990
<9-13,Leonard>艾米可要遭罪了
<9-13,Leonard>Mmm, that can't be much fun for Amy.

313
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,370
<9-13,Leonard>今天上班的时候  他喝了有生以来第一罐红牛
<9-13,Leonard>You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.

314
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,280
<9-14,Bernadette>然后怎么了
<9-14,Bernadette>What happened?

315
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,750
<9-15,Leonard>他在院子里追了一阵子松鼠  然后...
<9-15,Leonard>He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and...

316
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,560
<9-15,Leonard>在我车里吐了
<9-15,Leonard>...then threw up in my car.

317
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,960
<9-16,Bernadette>你们不觉得应该拦着他别做了吗
<9-16,Bernadette>Don't you think you should make him stop all this?

318
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,440
<9-17,Howard>我不确定  他也没伤害到别人
<9-17,Howard>I don't know-- he's not really hurting anybody.

319
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,550
<9-18,Leonard>那是因为储物箱的呕吐物不是你清
<9-18,Leonard>You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.

320
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,190
<9-19,Sheldon>他完成了很多工作
<9-19,Sheldon>He is getting a lot of work done.

321
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,910
<9-19,Sheldon>在质子衰变方面有了不错的发现
<9-19,Sheldon>He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.

322
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,510
<9-20,Raj>如果他能破解  那会改变世界的  同志们
<9-20,Raj>Wow, if he cracks that, it's a game changer, guys.

323
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,550
<9-20,Raj>那将会彻底重新定义
<9-20,Raj>It'll completely redefine our understanding

324
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,260
<9-20,Raj>我们对物质宇宙的理解
<9-20,Raj>of the physical universe.

325
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,590
<9-21,Howard>没有错
<9-21,Howard>Hmm, it would.

326
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,220
<9-21,Howard>好啦  欢迎回到"艾米丽还是小桂子"
<9-21,Howard>Okay, back to "Emily or Cinnamon""

327
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,960
<9-21,Howard>"如此娇小的身躯  怎吃得下硕大的牛排"
<9-21,Howard>"How can such a little girl eat such a big steak""

328
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,180
<9-21,Howard>谢尔顿
<9-21,Howard>Sheldon,

329
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,430
<10-1,Amy>我要你把那帽子摘了
<10-1,Amy>I want you to take that cap off.

330
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,250
<10-2,Sheldon>你这唠叨的语气有助于增长焦虑
<10-2,Sheldon>That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah.

331
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,620
<10-2,Sheldon>如果你的高音调能降低百分之十的话
<10-2,Sheldon>But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill,

332
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,010
<10-2,Sheldon>那你真是我的小呀小苹果了
<10-2,Sheldon>that'd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.

333
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,760
<10-3,Amy>抱歉  但你知道
<10-3,Amy>I'm sorry, but you know we agreed

334
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,790
<10-3,Amy>约会夜是不应该工作的
<10-3,Amy>not to bring work to date night.

335
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,520
<10-4,Sheldon>这就对了  完美
<10-4,Sheldon>There you go, perfect.

336
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,080
<10-5,Amy>谢尔顿  住手  我不是在开玩笑
<10-5,Amy>Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding.

337
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,850
<10-5,Amy>把帽子脱了  笔记本拿开
<10-5,Amy>Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.

338
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,080
<10-6,Sheldon>可我辛苦了几个月  终于开始有点突破
<10-6,Sheldon>But after months of struggling, I'm finally making progress.

339
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,300
<10-7,Amy>你没有必要为了工作  逼疯自己啊
<10-7,Amy>You don't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.

340
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,250
<10-8,Sheldon>没必要吗
<10-8,Sheldon>Or do I, hmm?

341
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,450
<10-8,Sheldon>艾萨克·牛顿爵士在相信自己是犰狳时
<10-8,Sheldon>Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia

342
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,320
<10-8,Sheldon>才写出了《自然哲学的数学原理》
<10-8,Sheldon>while convinced he was an armadillo.

343
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,660
<10-9,Amy>没这回事
<10-9,Amy>That's not true.

344
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,390
<10-10,Sheldon>好吧  也许是  也许不是
<10-10,Sheldon>Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

345
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,280
<10-10,Sheldon>我最近开始有幻觉了
<10-10,Sheldon>I have been hallucinating lately.

346
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,090
<10-11,Amy>谢尔顿  你必须停下来了
<10-11,Amy>Sheldon, this has to stop.

347
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,720
<10-11,Amy>你得去睡觉  照顾好自己的身体
<10-11,Amy>You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.

348
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,810
<10-12,Sheldon>艾米  我这几天的收获
<10-12,Sheldon>Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days

349
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,870
<10-12,Sheldon>比我开始研究暗物质以来全部加起来都多
<10-12,Sheldon>than I have since I made the switch to dark matter.

350
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,720
<10-12,Sheldon>万一我不继续下去  思路都不见了呢
<10-12,Sheldon>What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?

351
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,730
<10-13,Amy>你的思路和想法来自于你  而非你的焦虑
<10-13,Amy>Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.

352
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,130
<10-14,Sheldon>也许吧
<10-14,Sheldon>Hmm, perhaps.

353
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,800
<10-14,Sheldon>但我不会摘掉帽子的
<10-14,Sheldon>But I'm not taking the cap off.

354
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,690
<10-15,Amy>你折磨你自己是一回事
<10-15,Amy>It's one thing to make yourself miserable,

355
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,320
<10-15,Amy>但你让周围的人也都很痛苦
<10-15,Amy>but you're making everyone around you miserable, too.

356
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,120
<10-15,Amy>我最后再跟你说一遍  把帽子摘掉
<10-15,Amy>Now, I'm telling you for the last time-- take the cap off.

357
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,340
<10-15,Amy>是吗
<10-15,Amy>Really?

358
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,790
<10-16,Sheldon>我要是不摘呢
<10-16,Sheldon>What if I don't?

359
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,210
<10-16,Sheldon>在你回答问题之前  能把我的甜点上了吗
<10-16,Sheldon>And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?

360
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,610
<11-1,Sheldon>然后她就把我赶出去了
