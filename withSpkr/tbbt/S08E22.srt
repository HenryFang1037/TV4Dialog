1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,030
<1-1,Raj>这款是市面上最棒的一台了
<1-1,Raj>It's, like, the best one they make,

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,480
<1-1,Raj>可怎么弄都飞不起来
<1-1,Raj>I just can't get it to work.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,900
<1-2,Howard>我来弄吧
<1-2,Howard>I'll figure it out.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,350
<1-3,Raj>这玩意能边飞边串流高清影片到你手机上
<1-3,Raj>It streams HD video straight to your phone while it's flying.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,480
<1-3,Raj>赞
<1-3,Raj>Nice.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,890
<1-4,Howard>我单身的时候  这小宝贝在哪呢
<1-4,Howard>Where were you when I was single?

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,250
<1-5,Leonard>我们一小时内就得出发  你东西收拾好了吗
<1-5,Leonard>Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,770
<1-6,Penny>差不多  出发前再加几件东西进去就行
<1-6,Penny>Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things--

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,240
<1-6,Penny>就化妆品  内衣裤  衣服那些
<1-6,Penny>you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,450
<1-7,Sheldon>如果你的浴室地板能算手提行李
<1-7,Sheldon>If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on,

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,490
<1-7,Sheldon>那你算收拾完毕了
<1-7,Sheldon>you're packed.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
<1-8,Amy>莱纳德  你以前有在高中毕业典礼致辞过吗
<1-8,Amy>Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,620
<1-9,Leonard>没有  挺让人激动的
<1-9,Leonard>Nope. It's pretty exciting.

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,210
<1-10,Sheldon>你不怕被弄瞎吗
<1-10,Sheldon>Aren't you afraid of being blinded?

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,760
<1-11,Leonard>我为什么会被弄瞎
<1-11,Leonard>How would I be blinded?

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,120
<1-12,Sheldon>在毕业典礼的最后
<1-12,Sheldon>At the end of the ceremony,

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,460
<1-12,Sheldon>学生都会把四方尖角帽抛上天空
<1-12,Sheldon>all the students throw those pointy hats in the air.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,500
<1-12,Sheldon>场面还会挺有气势  直到有人被戳瞎眼
<1-12,Sheldon>It's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,280
<1-13,Leonard>我乐意赌一把
<1-13,Leonard>I'll take my chances.

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,120
<1-13,Leonard>随你
<1-13,Leonard>Fine.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,000
<1-14,Sheldon>你说有没有卖"我早说了"的点字版卡片
<1-14,Sheldon>I wonder if they make "I told you so" cards in braille.

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,120
<1-15,Raj>毕业典礼演讲最大的问题是
<1-15,Raj>Look, the problem with commencement speeches

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,010
<1-15,Raj>都很无聊
<1-15,Raj>is that they're boring.

24
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,620
<1-15,Raj>你有能发射T恤的T恤大炮吗
<1-15,Raj>Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?

25
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,020
<1-16,Howard>他没事为啥会有T恤大炮
<1-16,Howard>Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?

26
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,060
<1-17,Raj>不知道啊  但为啥我有咧
<1-17,Raj>I don't know. Why do I own one?

27
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,110
<1-18,Amy>我觉得你很贴心
<1-18,Amy>I think it's really nice

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,110
<1-18,Amy>愿意带佩妮分享这样的机会
<1-18,Amy>that you're sharing this experience with Penny.

29
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,500
<1-19,Leonard>我觉得带她去
<1-19,Leonard>Mm, I thought it'd be fun

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,610
<1-19,Leonard>我的母校地盘看看  应该蛮有意思
<1-19,Leonard>to show her my old stomping grounds.

31
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,860
<1-19,Leonard>我还记得我是在哪块"地盘"被人踩呢
<1-19,Leonard>I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,590
<1-20,Bernadette>但现在你能以成功科学家身份衣锦还乡啊
<1-20,Bernadette>Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.

33
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,130
<1-21,Amy>手里搂着美女
<1-21,Amy>With a beautiful girl on your arm.

34
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,090
<1-22,Sheldon>眼里还插着一顶四方尖角帽
<1-22,Sheldon>And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,330
<2-1,Leonard>你怎么能这么快就准备好呢
<2-1,Leonard>How'd you get ready so fast?

42
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,360
<2-2,Penny>我轻装上阵嘛
<2-2,Penny>Oh, I pack light.

43
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,160
<2-2,Penny>有一年的春假
<2-2,Penny>Once, I got through an entire spring break

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,180
<2-2,Penny>我回家就带了一件长T恤跟腰带
<2-2,Penny>with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.

45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,220
<2-3,Leonard>你为啥会需要腰带
<2-3,Leonard>Why did you need a belt?

46
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,870
<2-4,Penny>那叫晚装好吗
<2-4,Penny>It's called an evening look.

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,460
<2-4,Penny>我从来没去过新泽西呢
<2-4,Penny>I've never been to New Jersey before.

48
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,560
<2-5,Leonard>电视节目把它名声搞臭了
<2-5,Leonard>It gets a bad rap from shows

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
<2-5,Leonard>比如《泽西海滩》或《贵妇的真实生活》
<2-5,Leonard>like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,890
<2-5,Leonard>《泽西海滩》讲八名男女去泽西海岸打工  玩乐
<2-5,Leonard>《泽西贵妇的真实生活》就是有钱人在秀下限

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,890
<2-6,Penny>所以实情不是那样吗
<2-6,Penny>So it's not really like that?

52
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,840
<2-7,Leonard>没  还真的就像那样
<2-7,Leonard>No, it's like that.

53
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,240
<2-7,Leonard>但还是很期待能带你到处看看
<2-7,Leonard>Well, I'm excited to show you around.

54
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,170
<2-8,Penny>你觉得我们会有时间去探望你妈吗
<2-8,Penny>You think we'll have time to visit your mom over there?

55
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,910
<2-8,Penny>有啊
<2-8,Penny>Yes.

56
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,270
<2-9,Leonard>还时间把我的鸡鸡放进压蒜器呢
<2-9,Leonard>We'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press,

57
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,380
<2-9,Leonard>但我也不会因为有时间就做啊
<2-9,Leonard>but I'm not doing that either.

58
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,350
<2-9,Leonard>刚收到短信提醒
<2-9,Leonard>I just got an alert.

59
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,950
<2-9,Leonard>我们的班机被取消了
<2-9,Leonard>Our flight's been canceled.

60
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,940
<2-10,Penny>什么
<2-10,Penny>What?

61
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,040
<2-11,Leonard>东海岸这里好像有个很大的台风
<2-11,Leonard>Yeah, looks like there's a big storm all up the East Coast.

62
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,280
<2-12,Penny>能换别家的班机吗
<2-12,Penny>Well, can we get on another airline?

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,680
<2-13,Leonard>貌似不行
<2-13,Leonard>I don't think so.

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,180
<2-14,Penny>所以就这样  不去了吗
<2-14,Penny>So, that's it? We're not going?

65
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,530
<2-15,Leonard>看来是
<2-15,Leonard>I guess not.

66
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,650
<2-16,Penny>-也太衰了吧  -是啊
<2-16,Penny>- Well, that sucks. - Yeah.

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,770
<2-17,Leonard>我可是非常认真准备这段致辞呢
<2-17,Leonard>I worked hard on that speech, too.

68
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,470
<2-18,Penny>你可以念给我听啊
<2-18,Penny>Oh. You could tell it to me.

69
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,150
<2-19,Leonard>谢谢啊  不过不用啦
<2-19,Leonard>Oh, thank you, but I'm okay.

70
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,120
<2-20,Penny>你确定吗
<2-20,Penny>Are you sure?

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,730
<2-20,Penny>我可以假装我是高中拉拉队长
<2-20,Penny>I could pretend I'm a high school cheerleader

72
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,180
<2-20,Penny>对成功的校友没有任何抵抗力哦
<2-20,Penny>who can't control herself around esteemed alumni.

73
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,760
<2-21,Leonard>杰出的拉拉队员们  你们好吗
<2-21,Leonard>Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.

74
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,600
<3-1,Howard>无线网扩展器开启了  摄像机也开启了
<3-1,Howard>Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera's on,

75
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
<3-1,Howard>而且两者都连到了同个网
<3-1,Howard>they're both on the same network;

76
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,020
<3-1,Howard>我们应该能收到画面了啊
<3-1,Howard>we should be getting an image.

77
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,540
<3-2,Sheldon>我只能看到黑色的屏幕
<3-2,Sheldon>All I see is a black screen.

78
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,940
<3-2,Sheldon>以及我自己的倒影
<3-2,Sheldon>And my own reflection.

79
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,660
<3-2,Sheldon>我看起来好伤心
<3-2,Sheldon>I look sad.

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,600
<3-3,Howard>可能我们得重新校准一下
<3-3,Howard>Maybe we should recalibrate it.

81
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,530
<3-4,Sheldon>好吧
<3-4,Sheldon>All right.

82
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,210
<3-5,Howard>第一步: 快速扳动校准开关
<3-5,Howard>Step one: rapidly flip the calibration switch

83
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,640
<3-5,Howard>从最上方扳到最下方
<3-5,Howard>from the fully up to the fully down

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,520
<3-5,Howard>此动作最少重复十次
<3-5,Howard>positions for at least ten times.

85
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,250
<3-6,Sheldon>上面真写了"最少"吗
<3-6,Sheldon>It actually says "at least"?

86
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,330
<3-7,Howard>对啊
<3-7,Howard>Yeah.

87
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,850
<3-8,Sheldon>它为啥会写"最少"啊
<3-8,Sheldon>Why would they say "at least"?

88
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,560
<3-8,Sheldon>那到底是扳十次
<3-8,Sheldon>Is it ten toggles?

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,550
<3-8,Sheldon>还是扳一百次呢
<3-8,Sheldon>Is it 100 toggles? You know?

90
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,050
<3-8,Sheldon>还是扳一千次
<3-8,Sheldon>Is it 1,000 toggles?

91
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,520
<3-8,Sheldon>一万次呢
<3-8,Sheldon>10,000 toggles?

92
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,900
<3-8,Sheldon>-还是十万次  -谢尔顿
<3-8,Sheldon>- 100,000 toggles? - Sheldon!

93
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,210
<3-10,Sheldon>你懂我接下来要说的是什么
<3-10,Sheldon>You see where I'm going with this.

94
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,800
<3-11,Howard>你就快点扳就是了
<3-11,Howard>Just flip the switch

95
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,160
<3-11,Howard>直到无人机的灯变成长亮的黄色
<3-11,Howard>until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.

96
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,990
<3-12,Sheldon>好吧  这步看起来不难
<3-12,Sheldon>All right, that seems simple enough.

97
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,950
<3-13,Howard>启动校准程序
<3-13,Howard>Initiating calibration sequence.

98
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,030
<3-15,Howard>一  二  三  四
<3-15,Howard>One, two, three, four,

99
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,210
<3-16,Sheldon>五  六  七  八  九  十
<3-16,Sheldon>five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

100
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,340
<3-12,Sheldon>看来技术上来说  十等于"最少十下"
<3-12,Sheldon>Well, I suppose ten is technically "at least ten."

101
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,170
<3-12,Sheldon>但他们"最少"会收到一封愤怒的投诉信
<3-12,Sheldon>But they're still getting at least one angry letter.

102
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,300
<3-13,Howard>现在沿着中轴
<3-13,Howard>Now I rotate it horizontally

103
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,640
<3-13,Howard>水平旋转它  直到灯号变成绿色
<3-13,Howard>on its center axis until the lights turn green.

104
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,900
<3-14,Sheldon>启动旋转程序
<3-14,Sheldon>Initiating rotation sequence.

105
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,780
<3-14,Sheldon>看我干嘛  启动啊
<3-14,Sheldon>Don't look at me, initiate.

106
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,190
<3-14,Sheldon>这红跟黄灯代表什么意思
<3-14,Sheldon>What does red and yellow mean?

107
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,950
<3-15,Howard>代表校准失败
<3-15,Howard>It means the calibration failed.

108
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,260
<3-15,Howard>我们得从头再来
<3-15,Howard>We have to start over.

109
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,670
<3-15,Howard>好吧
<3-15,Howard>Oh. Very well.

110
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,250
<3-16,Sheldon>重新启动校准程序
<3-16,Sheldon>Reinitiating calibration sequence.

111
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,880
<3-16,Sheldon>一  二  三  四
<3-16,Sheldon>One, two, three, four,

112
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,430
<3-16,Sheldon>五  六  七  八  九  十
<3-16,Sheldon>five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

113
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,810
<3-16,Sheldon>十一
<3-16,Sheldon>...eleven.

114
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,630
<3-16,Sheldon>还好那封信我没有寄出
<3-16,Sheldon>It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.

115
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,840
<4-1,Raj>老爸  最近还好吗
<4-1,Raj>Hello, Daddy. What's up?

116
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,520
<4-2,Dr Koothrapalli>还行  就想看看我儿子最近好不好
<4-2,Dr Koothrapalli>Not much, just wanted to see how my son's doing.

117
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,400
<4-3,Raj>很好啊  谢谢关心
<4-3,Raj>Very well, thank you.

118
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,810
<4-4,Dr Koothrapalli>你还在跟那位皮肤科医生约会吗
<4-4,Dr Koothrapalli>Are you still dating that dermatologist?

119
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,760
<4-5,Raj>如果你能摸到我的皮肤多柔嫩
<4-5,Raj>If you could feel how soft my skin is,

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,880
<4-5,Raj>你就不会问了
<4-5,Raj>you wouldn't have to ask.

121
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,490
<4-6,Dr Koothrapalli>我还有另一件事想问你
<4-6,Dr Koothrapalli>Oh, and there's something else I wanted to ask you.

122
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,440
<4-6,Dr Koothrapalli>你为啥把一个月的房租钱拿去买玩具飞机
<4-6,Dr Koothrapalli>Why did you spend a month's rent on a toy helicopter?!

123
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,060
<4-7,Raj>原来那张账单是寄给你了啊
<4-7,Raj>Oh, you're where that bill goes.

124
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,790
<4-8,Dr Koothrapalli>我受够了纵容你的白痴生活
<4-8,Dr Koothrapalli>I'm tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle.

125
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,470
<4-8,Dr Koothrapalli>是时候让你学会负起责任了
<4-8,Dr Koothrapalli>It's time you learned responsibility.

126
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,860
<4-8,Dr Koothrapalli>而唯一能教会你这事的方法
<4-8,Dr Koothrapalli>And the only way to teach you that

127
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,440
<4-8,Dr Koothrapalli>不再给你零用钱
<4-8,Dr Koothrapalli>is to cut off your allowance.

128
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,260
<4-9,Raj>不行  爸  不行
<4-9,Raj>No, Daddy, no!

129
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,850
<4-9,Raj>能让我学会负责任的方法多了去了
<4-9,Raj>There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility.

130
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,100
<4-9,Raj>比如你可以给我颗鸡蛋
<4-9,Raj>I know, you can give me an egg

131
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,770
<4-9,Raj>让我照顾好它整整一周啊
<4-9,Raj>and make me take care of it for a week!

132
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,190
<4-10,Dr Koothrapalli>不必了  我已经决定了
<4-10,Dr Koothrapalli>No, my mind is made up.

133
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,630
<4-10,Dr Koothrapalli>从现在开始  你自食其力吧
<4-10,Dr Koothrapalli>Starting now, you're on your own.

134
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,540
<4-11,Raj>可是爸比  我好想家人
<4-11,Raj>But, Daddy, I-I miss my family so much,

135
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,760
<4-11,Raj>你跟妈咪又离婚了
<4-11,Raj>and with you and Mummy getting a divorce,

136
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,920
<4-11,Raj>我好不开心又好空虚
<4-11,Raj>I feel sad and empty.

137
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,200
<4-11,Raj>偶尔买个小玩具
<4-11,Raj>Buying a little toy every now and then

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,410
<4-11,Raj>能帮助我填满心中的空虚
<4-11,Raj>helps me fill that void.

139
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,150
<4-11,Raj>所以尽管我不能天天拥抱你
<4-11,Raj>So while I can't hug you every day,

140
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,470
<4-11,Raj>飞那台直升机...
<4-11,Raj>flying that helicopter...

141
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,780
<4-12,Dr Koothrapalli>我要断了你
<4-12,Dr Koothrapalli>I'm cutting you off.

142
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,510
<4-13,Raj>我确认一下  是断钱  还是挂断电话
<4-13,Raj>Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?

143
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,160
<5-1,Howard>别跳红黄灯啊
<5-1,Howard>No red and yellow,

144
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
<5-1,Howard>别跳黄红灯啊
<5-1,Howard>no red and yellow.

145
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,810
<5-4,Sheldon>-变绿了  -我们成功了
<5-4,Sheldon>- It's green! - Yay! We did it!

146
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,070
<5-4,Sheldon>天啊  光捧着转就这么有意思
<5-4,Sheldon>God, if it's this much fun to rotate,

147
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,080
<5-4,Sheldon>等飞起来还得了
<5-4,Sheldon>imagine when we fly it.

148
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,470
<5-5,Howard>好了  现在我只需垂直旋转机体
<5-5,Howard>Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically

149
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,490
<5-5,Howard>直到绿灯熄灭
<5-5,Howard>until the lights turn off.

150
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,470
<5-6,Sheldon>不
<5-6,Sheldon>Oh, no!

151
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,000
<5-6,Sheldon>好了  娱乐时间结束
<5-6,Sheldon>All right, playtime's over.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,730
<5-7,Howard>咱们把这宝贝拆开吧
<5-7,Howard>Let's open this baby up.

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,970
<5-8,Sheldon>拆开就不能保修了
<5-8,Sheldon>Won't that void the warranty?

154
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,090
<5-9,Howard>谢尔顿  我有一个工程学硕士学位
<5-9,Howard>Sheldon, I have a master's degree in engineering.

155
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,430
<5-9,Howard>保修卡只配给我擦屁股
<5-9,Howard>I wipe my bottom with warranties.

156
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,420
<5-9,Howard>苹果的保修除外
<5-9,Howard>Except for AppleCare.

157
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,420
<5-9,Howard>从长远来看  维修费很快会回本
<5-9,Howard>That pays for itself in the long run.

158
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,800
<6-2,Leonard>你去哪儿了
<6-2,Leonard>Hey, where'd you go?

159
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,550
<6-3,Penny>我给你买了点东西  让你开心开心

164
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,390

<6-6,Leonard>A cap and gown?

165
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,930
<6-6,Leonard>我为什么会需要这俩玩意
<6-6,Leonard>Why do I need a cap and gown?

166
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,750
<6-7,Penny>因为你要在毕业典礼上致辞
<6-7,Penny>Because you are giving your commencement speech.

167
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,880
<6-8,Leonard>你在说什么呀
<6-8,Leonard>What are you talking about?

168
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,010
<6-9,Penny>我打给你以前的高中
<6-9,Penny>I called your old high school

169
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,070
<6-9,Penny>说服他们让你通过视频聊天在典礼上致辞
<6-9,Penny>and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.

170
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,680
<6-9,Penny>真的吗
<6-9,Penny>Really?

171
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,650
<6-10,Leonard>太棒了
<6-10,Leonard>That's amazing!

172
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,780

<6-11,Penny>店里只剩下性感毕业生装束了
<6-11,Penny>and all they had left was sexy graduate,

177
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,960
<6-11,Penny>所以长袍...
<6-11,Penny>so they...

178
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,780
<6-11,Penny>可能会有点短
<6-11,Penny>might be a little short.

179
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,060
<6-12,Leonard>-又短[矮]又性感  我的强项嘛  -没错
<6-12,Leonard>- Short and sexy, that's my wheelhouse. - Yeah!

<7-4,Sheldon>What about this one?

184
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,530
<7-5,Howard>这个嘛...你熟不熟
<7-5,Howard>Well, I... how familiar are you

185
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,230
<7-5,Howard>小型集成逻辑电路呢
<7-5,Howard>with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?

186
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,990
<7-6,Sheldon>不太熟
<7-6,Sheldon>Not very.

187
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,040
<7-7,Howard>那你手里拿着的正是这玩意
<7-7,Howard>That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.

188
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,750
<7-8,Sheldon>那你能修好它吗
<7-8,Sheldon>So, can you get it working?

189
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,160
<7-9,Howard>我可是麻省理工毕业的工程师
<7-9,Howard>I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

190
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,220
<7-9,Howard>我还为太空站出过一份力呢
<7-9,Howard>I've built components for the space station.

191
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,500
<7-10,Sheldon>我还以为那个零重力厕所不能用呢
<7-10,Sheldon>I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work.

192
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,280
<7-11,Howard>能用好吗
<7-11,Howard>It worked fine,

193
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,100
<7-11,Howard>只不过设计不适合俄罗斯宇航员
<7-11,Howard>it just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts

194
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,310
<7-11,Howard>以及他们的全是马铃薯的饮食
<7-11,Howard>and their potato-based diet.

195
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,560
<7-12,Raj>你好啊

198
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,600
<7-15,Raj>你俩干了什么好事
<7-15,Raj>What did you do?!

199
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,300
<7-15,Raj>别担心
<7-15,Raj>Well, don't worry.

200
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,900
<7-16,Sheldon>他是麻省理工毕业的
<7-16,Sheldon>He went to MIT.

201
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,650
<7-16,Sheldon>他可以解决任何问题
<7-16,Sheldon>He can solve any problem,

202
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,730
<7-16,Sheldon>只要不是来自俄罗斯人的结肠就行
<7-16,Sheldon>as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.

203
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,700
<7-17,Raj>真他妈不敢相信
<7-17,Raj>I don't freaking believe this!

204
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,280
<7-18,Howard>别紧张  能装回去
<7-18,Howard>Relax, it'll be fine.

205
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,500
<7-19,Raj>不是  你现在必须装回去
<7-19,Raj>No, you have to put this back together right now,

206
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,750
<7-19,Raj>我才能拿去退
<7-19,Raj>so I can return it!

207
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,390
<7-20,Sheldon>你退不了了
<7-20,Sheldon>You can't return it.

208
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,420
<7-20,Sheldon>霍华德用保修卡擦屁股了
<7-20,Sheldon>Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
<7-21,Raj>什么
<7-21,Raj>What?!

210
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,790
<7-22,Sheldon>我猜他可能只是打个比方
<7-22,Sheldon>I think metaphorically.

211
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,860
<7-22,Sheldon>但他刚真进了厕所好一会呢
<7-22,Sheldon>But he was in the bathroom for a while.

212
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,440
<7-23,Raj>霍华德  我爸不给我零用钱花了
<7-23,Raj>Howard, my father cut me off.

<7-23,Raj>我得把这玩意退了  把钱拿回来
<7-23,Raj>I have to get my money back for this!

214
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,060
<7-24,Howard>冷静
<7-24,Howard>Calm down.

215

<7-24,Howard>好吧
<7-24,Howard>Okay.

216
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,040
<7-25,Raj>好吧  你是对的
<7-25,Raj>Okay, you're right.

217
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,930
<7-25,Raj>我是时候站出来
<7-25,Raj>It's time for me to step up

218
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,310
<7-25,Raj>为自己的人生负责了
<7-25,Raj>and take responsibility for my life.

219
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,400
<7-25,Raj>当个爷们

226
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,700
<7-28,Mrs Koothrapalli>真不敢相信你是来自你父亲的毒种
<7-28,Mrs Koothrapalli>Can't believe you come from the poison seed of your father.

227
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,380
<7-29,Raj>我觉得我比较随你
<7-29,Raj>Well, I like to think I take mostly after you.

228
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,570
<7-29,Raj>对了  说起爸爸
<7-29,Raj>Anyway, speaking of Daddy,

229
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,990
<7-29,Raj>我们刚进行了一次非常奇怪的通话
<7-29,Raj>I had a very strange conversation with him.

230
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,100
<7-29,Raj>他说以后没钱打生活费给我了
<7-29,Raj>He said he couldn't afford to send me money anymore

231
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,050
<7-30,Mrs Koothrapalli>因为他有活跃的社交生活
<7-30,Mrs Koothrapalli>because of his active social life.

232
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,240
<7-30,Mrs Koothrapalli>这话什么意思  "活跃的社交生活"
<7-30,Mrs Koothrapalli>What does that mean, "active social life"?

233
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,150
<7-31,Raj>好啦  咱们别聊他了
<7-31,Raj>Well, let's not talk about him

234
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,480
<7-31,Raj>谁在乎他有没有在密谋什么诡计啊
<7-31,Raj>or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to.

235
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,010
<7-31,Raj>咱们来聊聊你吧
<7-31,Raj>Let's talk about you.

236
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,370
<7-32,Mrs Koothrapalli>拉杰什  你爸是不是跟人约会了
<7-32,Mrs Koothrapalli>Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?

237
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,470
<7-33,Raj>妈咪  我只知道他是一个单身多金的医生
<7-33,Raj>All I know, Mummy, is that he's a single wealthy doctor,

238
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,900
<7-33,Raj>而现在出于某种原因
<7-33,Raj>and now, for some reason,

239
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,300
<7-33,Raj>突然没钱给你的宝贝儿子了
<7-33,Raj>there's no money for your little boy.

240
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,620
<7-34,Mrs Koothrapalli>好  不管你老爸之前给你多少钱
<7-34,Mrs Koothrapalli>Well, however much money your father was giving you,

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,890
<7-35,Raj>一人一台直升机
<7-35,Raj>Helicopters for everybody!

244
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,900
<8-1,Penny>怎么这么久啊
<8-1,Penny>What's taking so long?

245
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,890
<8-2,Leonard>我觉得这么穿不行
<8-2,Leonard>I don't think this is gonna work.

246
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,880
<8-3,Penny>出来给我看看
<8-3,Penny>Just let me see.

247
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,340
<8-3,Penny>亲爱的  毕业长袍里
<8-3,Penny>Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes

248
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,240
<8-3,Penny>应该穿上衣服
<8-3,Penny>underneath a graduation gown.

249
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,040
<8-4,Leonard>首先  我很惊讶你知道这点
<8-4,Leonard>A: surprised you know that.

250
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,100
<8-4,Leonard>其次  我想让你觉得我是一个性感毕业生
<8-4,Leonard>B: I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.

251
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
<8-5,Penny>你成功了
<8-5,Penny>Well, you do.

252
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,080
<8-6,Leonard>-谢谢  -好啦
<8-6,Leonard>- Thank you. - Yeah.

253
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,220
<8-7,Penny>反正你是视频语聊  他们也看不到你的腿
<8-7,Penny>You're gonna be on Skype; they're not gonna see your legs.

254
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,420
<8-8,Leonard>以防万一  我还是穿上裤子吧
<8-8,Leonard>Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case.

255
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,340
<8-8,Leonard>但我要说一句  这样穿真的好"解放"
<8-8,Leonard>But I have to say, this is very freeing.

256
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,420
<8-9,Penny>系条腰带  我就带你去个好地方
<8-9,Penny>Add a belt and I'll take you someplace nice.

257
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,010
<8-10,Leonard>没问题
<8-10,Leonard>Done and done.

258
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,030
<9-1,Howard>好了  我已经把故障缩小到
<9-1,Howard>Okay, I think I've narrowed it down

259
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,790
<9-1,Howard>飞机通讯芯片上一个错误的针脚
<9-1,Howard>to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.

260
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,050
<9-2,Sheldon>真厉害
<9-2,Sheldon>Very impressive.

261
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,300
<9-2,Sheldon>等你修完那台
<9-2,Sheldon>You know, when you're done with that,

262
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,140
<9-2,Sheldon>可以看下这台吗
<9-2,Sheldon>can you look at this?

263
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,890
<9-2,Sheldon>它不会冒烟了
<9-2,Sheldon>It doesn't make smoke anymore.

264
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,680
<9-3,Howard>一个个来
<9-3,Howard>One toy at a time.

265
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,880
<9-4,Sheldon>抱歉
<9-4,Sheldon>Mm. Sorry.

266
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,640
<9-4,Sheldon>或许这样最好
<9-4,Sheldon>Ah, maybe it's for the best.

267
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,450
<9-4,Sheldon>我听说火车头的烟
<9-4,Sheldon>I hear locomotive smoke

268
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,150
<9-4,Sheldon>是火车宅们第二大死因
<9-4,Sheldon>is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.

269
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,920
<9-5,Raj>第一大死因是什么
<9-5,Raj>What's the first one?

270
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,750
<9-6,Howard>自杀
<9-6,Howard>Suicide.

271
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,850
<9-7,Sheldon>错
<9-7,Sheldon>Wrong.

272
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,180
<9-7,Sheldon>肥胖
<9-7,Sheldon>Obesity.

273
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,040
<9-8,Bernadette>我把你要的工具拿来了
<9-8,Bernadette>I have the tool you wanted.

274
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,430
<9-9,Howard>谢谢
<9-9,Howard>Thank you.

275
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,270
<9-10,Raj>你们其实不必这么费劲
<9-10,Raj>You guys don't have to go to the trouble.

276
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,250
<9-10,Raj>哥现在又有钱了
<9-10,Raj>I'm back in the money now;

277
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,170
<9-10,Raj>再买一台就好啦
<9-10,Raj>I can just buy another helicopter.

278
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,220
<9-11,Howard>重点不是钱
<9-11,Howard>It's not about the money.

279
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,620
<9-11,Howard>而是解决问题
<9-11,Howard>It's about solving a problem.

280
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,200
<9-11,Howard>这是我当工程师的初衷
<9-11,Howard>It's why I became an engineer.

281
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,750
<9-11,Howard>我喜欢做这个  我学的也是这个
<9-11,Howard>It's what I like to do, it's what I'm trained to do.

282
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,880
<9-11,Howard>这就是我
<9-11,Howard>It's who I am.

283
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,460
<9-12,Sheldon>瞧你  小工程师做到了
<9-12,Sheldon>Oh, look at you-- the little engineer that could.

285
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,100
<9-13,Bernadette>为什么不找技术支持呢
<9-13,Bernadette>Why don't you just call tech support?

286
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,980
<9-16,Raj>-说啥呢  -太逊了
<9-16,Raj>- Hey! - Not cool!

287
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,740
<9-17,Bernadette>怎么了
<9-17,Bernadette>What?

288
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,510
<9-18,Howard>这个世上有两种人
<9-18,Howard>There's two kinds of people in this world:

289
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,980
<9-18,Howard>打给技术支持求助的人
<9-18,Howard>those who call tech support

290
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,310
<9-18,Howard>与嘲笑前者的那种人
<9-18,Howard>and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.

291
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,150
<9-19,Bernadette>我就每次都打给技术支持啊
<9-19,Bernadette>I call tech support all the time.

292
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,640
<9-21,Sheldon>-你居然找技术支持  -真没用
<9-21,Sheldon>- You call tech support! - What a baby!

293
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,210
<10-1,Headmaster>现在  我们的毕业典礼演讲
<10-1,Headmaster>And now, for our commencement address,

294
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,900

<10-2,Leonard (on screen)>我脑海中一直想起上次来这礼堂的情景
<10-2,Leonard (on screen)>I can't help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium.

305
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,160

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,330
<11-15,Raj>没有啊
<11-15,Raj>Nothing.

334
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,110
<11-15,Raj>我就打给她问个好
<11-15,Raj>I was just calling to check in,

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,560
<11-15,Raj>看看她最近怎么样啊
<11-15,Raj>make sure she's doing okay.

336
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,720
<11-16,Dr Koothrapalli>她跟你说完电话后
<11-16,Dr Koothrapalli>Well, after talking to you,

337
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,760
<11-16,Dr Koothrapalli>她貌似觉得我是个风流浪子
<11-16,Dr Koothrapalli>she seems to think I'm some sort of playboy.

338
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,200
<11-16,Dr Koothrapalli>真的吗
<11-16,Dr Koothrapalli>Really?

339
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,240
<11-17,Raj>我不知道她怎么会产生这种想法
<11-17,Raj>I don't know where she'd get an idea like that.

340
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,230
<11-17,Raj>你也懂妈咪这人  还有她常会乱想
<11-17,Raj>You know mummy and her crazy imagination.

341
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,150
<11-17,Raj>我觉得我能随你真是太幸运了
<11-17,Raj>I'm so lucky I take after you.

342
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,380
<11-18,Dr Koothrapalli>你觉得你是随我吗
<11-18,Dr Koothrapalli>You think you take after me?

343
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,270
<11-19,Raj>我尽量这么想啊
<11-19,Raj>Well, I try to.

344
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,980
<11-19,Raj>如果不是有你做榜样
<11-19,Raj>I certainly wouldn't be a scientist

345
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,370
<11-19,Raj>我也不会去当科学家
<11-19,Raj>if you hadn't been my role model.

346
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,890
<11-19,Raj>谁想坐真的直升飞机去拉斯维加斯
<11-19,Raj>Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?!

347
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,730
<11-19,Raj>弗兰克·鲍姆曾说过
<11-19,Raj>It was L. Frank Baum who said,

348
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,590
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>"多厉害的小偷  都无法偷走别人脑中的知识
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>"No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge,

349
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,700
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>所以知识是最棒最安全的宝藏"
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure."

350
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,650
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>我自己听了都觉得无聊
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>Wow, I'm boring myself.

351
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,970
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>抱歉  我现在看不到你们的表情
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>Sorry, I can't see any of your faces right now,

352
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,470
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>但我猜大概是这样
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>but I bet they look like this.

353
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,750
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>其实  我写了整篇致辞
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>Uh, you know, I-I wrote an entire speech

354
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,430
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>要说高中让你准备好面对未来
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>to say how high school prepares you

355
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,940
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>以及高中有多美好
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>and what a wonderful place it is,

356
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,300
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>但其实我超讨厌高中
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>but I hated it.

357
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,260
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>或许有人高中过得很开心  前提是你长这样...
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>Maybe high school's great if you look like this...

358
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,400
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>但其实我当年觉得自己超没存在感
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>...but I didn't even feel like I existed at that school.

359
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,570
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>现在我仔细一想
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>And now that I think about it,

360
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,800
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>我猜你们很多人也有这种感觉
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>I bet a lot of you feel the same way.

361
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,340
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>所以我接下来的致辞
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>So, for the remainder of my speech,

362
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,030
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>要献给没有存在感的孩子们
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>this is for the invisible kids.

363
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,100
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>或许你在学校格格不入
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>Uh, maybe you never fit in.

364
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,530
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>或许你是学校里最矮小
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>Or maybe you're the smallest kid in the school,

365
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,790
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>最胖的  或最怪的孩子
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>or the heaviest or the weirdest.

366
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,890
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>或许你都要毕业了
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>Maybe you're graduating

367
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,330
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>可到现在初吻还在
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>and you still haven't had your first kiss.

368
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,780
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>比如我是到19岁
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>By the way, 19;

369
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,890
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>洁拉尔丁·珂珂  无论此时你在哪  谢谢你
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you.

370
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,740
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>或许你没有任何朋友
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>Maybe you don't have any friends.

371
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,640
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>其实  这根本无所谓
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>And guess what? That's okay.

372
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,250
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>尽管那些人缘好的孩子们都去干...
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>While all the popular kids are off doing--

373
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,810
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>其实我也不知道他们去干嘛了
<12-1,Leonard (on screen)>whatever, I don't know what they were doing

374
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,150
<12-2,Penny>因为我没机会去
<12-2,Penny>'cause I was never there...

375
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,970
<12-2,Penny>我  我等会告诉你
<12-2,Penny>I'll-I'll tell you later.

376
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,480
<12-3,Leonard>但我的重点是
<12-3,Leonard>My point is,

377
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,440
<12-3,Leonard>那些你独自一人度过的时间
<12-3,Leonard>while you're spending all this time on your own,

378
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,210
<12-3,Leonard>比如组装电脑  或练习大提琴
<12-3,Leonard>building computers or practicing your cello,

379
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,780
<12-3,Leonard>其实你真正在做的是
<12-3,Leonard>what you're really doing

380
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,480
<12-3,Leonard>让自己变有趣
<12-3,Leonard>is becoming interesting.

381
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,280
<12-3,Leonard>等有天别人终于注意到你时
<12-3,Leonard>And when people finally do notice you,

382
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,700
<12-3,Leonard>他们会发现一个比他们想象中更酷的人
<12-3,Leonard>they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought.

383
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,250
<12-3,Leonard>至于那些高中人缘好玩得开的同学
<12-3,Leonard>And for those of you who were popular in high school,

384
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,880
<12-3,Leonard>好日子到头了  抱歉
<12-3,Leonard>it's over, sorry.

385
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,570
<12-3,Leonard>谢谢各位  恭喜你们毕业
<12-3,Leonard>Thank you and congratulations.

<13-1,Tech Support Voice>你们的来电对我们十分重要
<13-1,Tech Support Voice>Your call is important to us.

<13-1,Tech Support Voice>and someone will be with you shortly.

390
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,970
<13-2,Howard>我这是怎么了
<13-2,Howard>What happened to me?

391
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,830
<13-2,Howard>我什么时候变成了老人
<13-2,Howard>When did I become an old man

392
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,170
<13-2,Howard>被现代科技所困惑
<13-2,Howard>baffled by modern technology?

393
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,040
<13-2,Howard>接下来
<13-2,Howard>Next thing you know,

394
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,930
<13-2,Howard>我估计就要穿高到我腋下的高腰裤
<13-2,Howard>I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits

395
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,470
<13-2,Howard>然后骂骂咧咧
<13-2,Howard>and complaining about

396
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,690
<13-2,Howard>现在小孩听的音乐有多难听了
<13-2,Howard>the awful music the kids are listening to.

397
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,610
<13-3,Sheldon>的确是很难听啊  对吧
<13-3,Sheldon>It is awful, isn't it?

398
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,390
<13-3,Sheldon>你们听听这噪音
<13-3,Sheldon>Listen to that noise.

399
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,740
<13-4,Howard>等等  等等
<13-4,Howard>Hang on, hang on.

400
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,230
<13-4,Howard>它好了  我成功了
<13-4,Howard>It's working! I did it!

401
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,000
<13-5,Raj>你怎么做到的
<13-5,Raj>How'd you do that?

402
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,510
<13-6,Howard>不知道啊  但我成功了
<13-6,Howard>No idea, but I did it!

403
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,020
<13-7,Bernadette>不应该在室内飞吧
<13-7,Bernadette>Maybe you shouldn't be flying it inside.

404
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,230
<13-8,Howard>不是我控制它
<13-8,Howard>Well, I'm not flying it!

405
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,220
<13-9,Sheldon>那谁在控制
<13-9,Sheldon>Then who is?

406
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,070
<13-9,Sheldon>我不知道
<13-9,Sheldon>I don't know!

407
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,540
<13-10,Howard>肯定是从别的地方接收到了无线信号
<13-10,Howard>Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else!

408
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,680
<13-11,Sheldon>启动降落程序  启动降落程序
<13-11,Sheldon>Initiate landing sequence! Initiate landing sequence!

409
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,900
