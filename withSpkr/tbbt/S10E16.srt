1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:04,910
<1-1,Howard>开始
<1-1,Howard>Go!

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,440
<1-1,Howard>拉杰  加油
<1-1,Howard>Come on, Raj!

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,100
<1-2,Leonard>你可以的
<1-2,Leonard>You can do this!

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,140
<1-3,Sheldon>绝对不可能
<1-3,Sheldon>There's no way.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,080
<1-4,Penny>这是在干嘛
<1-4,Penny>What is happening?

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,330
<1-5,Leonard>这是欧拉盘
<1-5,Leonard>This is an Euler's Disk.

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,120
<1-5,Leonard>是一种物理学玩具
<1-5,Leonard>It's a physics toy

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,940
<1-5,Leonard>用来演示角动量
<1-5,Leonard>that demonstrates angular momentum,

9
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,950
<1-5,Leonard>势能与动能
<1-5,Leonard>potential energy, and kinetic energy.

10
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,090
<1-6,Penny>你们几个小宅男还看体育呢
<1-6,Penny>Aw, look at you watching sports.

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,520
<1-7,Howard>我们在打赌库萨帕里
<1-7,Howard>We're betting to see if Koothrappali

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,700
<1-7,Howard>能不能憋气到这欧拉盘静止后才呼吸
<1-7,Howard>can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.

13
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,180
<1-8,Sheldon>它的重量与平滑度
<1-8,Sheldon>Its weight and smoothness,

14
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,950
<1-8,Sheldon>再加上底下镜面盘的些微凹度
<1-8,Sheldon>along with the slight concavity of the mirror,

15
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,600
<1-8,Sheldon>都意味着它可以转很久
<1-8,Sheldon>means it can spin for a long time.

16
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,070
<1-9,Leonard>但拉杰来自印度
<1-9,Leonard>But Raj is from India,

17
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,270
<1-9,Leonard>这表示在憋气这件事上  他也是经验丰富
<1-9,Leonard>which means he's no slouch at holding his breath.

18
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,340
<1-10,Penny>我也要赌  我赌十块钱
<1-10,Penny>Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says

19
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,720
<1-10,Penny>我会在这玩意静止之前就对这事失去兴致
<1-10,Penny>I'll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.

20
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,830
<1-11,Amy>谢尔顿  我找到一家适合约会的餐厅
<1-11,Amy>Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.

21
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,630
<1-12,Sheldon>现在很忙  别吵
<1-12,Sheldon>Kind of busy right now.

22
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,500
<1-13,Amy>是欧拉盘  真有趣
<1-13,Amy>Oh, an Euler's Disk! Fun!

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,890
<1-14,Howard>我们在看是它转的时间久  还是拉杰憋气时间久
<1-14,Howard>Yeah, we're seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.

24
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,200
<1-15,Amy>真幼稚
<1-15,Amy>Oh. Immature.

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,190
<1-16,Leonard>憋得住吗
<1-16,Leonard>How ya doing?

26
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,300
<1-17,Sheldon>他绝对不行
<1-17,Sheldon>He's not gonna make it.

27
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,780
<1-18,Howard>-他行的  -你知道吗
<1-18,Howard>- Yes, he is! - You know,

28
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,570
<1-19,Sheldon>深水潜水员在憋气好几分钟后
<1-19,Sheldon>deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes

29
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,850
<1-19,Sheldon>所发出脑损伤信号的
<1-19,Sheldon>have shown elevated markers of a protein

30
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,520
<1-19,Sheldon>蛋白质明显增多
<1-19,Sheldon>that can signal brain damage.

31
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,520
<1-20,Penny>这里正发生的事情也是脑损伤的信号
<1-20,Penny>Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage.

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,010
<1-20,Penny>天啊  这东西会转多久啊
<1-20,Penny>My God, how long does this thing spin for?

33
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,880
<1-21,Howard>你感兴趣了  十块钱输掉啦
<1-21,Howard>Ha! You're interested! You're out ten bucks!

34
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,280
<1-22,Sheldon>-开始慢下来了  -发挥你的潜力
<1-22,Sheldon>- It's slowing down! - Dig deep!

35
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,490
<1-23,Leonard>就像那次我们打赌你穿不进霍华德的裤子
<1-23,Leonard>Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,300
<1-24,Sheldon>他撑不下去啦
<1-24,Sheldon>He's not gonna make it!

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,290
<1-24,Sheldon>他可以的
<1-24,Sheldon>Yes, he is!

38
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,170
<1-25,Leonard>加油啊  拉杰  就像你最爱的电影
<1-25,Leonard>Come on, Raj! It's like your favorite movie!

39
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,570
<1-26,Howard>你要"憋到梦醒时分"
<1-26,Howard>You're just Waiting to Exhale!

43
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,240
<1-26,Howard>我就知道你可以
<1-26,Howard>Yeah! I knew you could do it!

46
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,150
<1-27,Raj>另...  另外告诉你
<1-27,Raj>And j.. and just so you know,

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,750
<1-27,Raj>我最爱的电影...

48
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,400
<1-27,Raj>是《公主新娘》
<1-27,Raj>is Princess Bride.

60
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,840
<2-1,Dr Koothrapalli (on skype)>拉杰什  最近好吗
<2-1,Dr Koothrapalli (on skype)>Hello, Rajesh. How are things by you?

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,230
<2-2,Raj>挺好  挺好啊
<2-2,Raj>Good, good.

62
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,170
<2-2,Raj>我想先跟你说一下
<2-2,Raj>Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know

63
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,520
<2-2,Raj>你这个月看到我信用卡账单时
<2-2,Raj>when you get my credit card bill,

64
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,310
<2-2,Raj>可能会发现这个月账有点多
<2-2,Raj>it might be a little high this month.

65
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,710
<2-3,Dr Koothrapalli>毕竟你也是个有稳定工作收入的成年人
<2-3,Dr Koothrapalli>Well, you're a grown man with a steady job.

66
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,410
<2-3,Dr Koothrapalli>花光你老爸的钱也是合情合理的嘛
<2-3,Dr Koothrapalli>Why wouldn't you spend all your father's money?

67
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,640
<2-4,Raj>爹爹  你真是又有钱又幽默
<2-4,Raj>Oh, Daddy, you're so rich and funny.

68
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,960
<2-5,Dr Koothrapalli>所以你最近还有什么别的事呢
<2-5,Dr Koothrapalli>Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?

69
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,030
<2-6,Raj>我之前跟大学里的一个女人约会
<2-6,Raj>Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university,

70
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,340
<2-6,Raj>不过后来分手了
<2-6,Raj>but we broke up.

71
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,860
<2-7,Dr Koothrapalli>我很遗憾听到这消息
<2-7,Dr Koothrapalli>I'm sorry to hear that.

72
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,880
<2-8,Raj>我知道  以我帮你买了新iPad来安慰我
<2-8,Raj>I know you are. That's why you just bought me a new iPad.

73
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,980
<2-8,Raj>我想先告诉你
<2-8,Raj>And before you start,

74
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,120
<2-8,Raj>我对你的包办婚姻一点兴趣都没有
<2-8,Raj>I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,670
<2-9,Dr Koothrapalli>我几百年前就放弃这事了好吗
<2-9,Dr Koothrapalli>Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.

76
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,750
<2-10,Raj>是吗
<2-10,Raj>You did?

77
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,050
<2-11,Dr Koothrapalli>太累人了
<2-11,Dr Koothrapalli>It's too much work.

78
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,220
<2-11,Dr Koothrapalli>你都几岁了还得靠
<2-11,Dr Koothrapalli>You're an adult who can't get by

79
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,580
<2-11,Dr Koothrapalli>老爸老妈给的零花钱才能过活
<2-11,Dr Koothrapalli>without an allowance from his parents.

80
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,450
<2-11,Dr Koothrapalli>女人才不喜欢这种男人
<2-11,Dr Koothrapalli>Women don't want that.

81
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,530
<2-12,Raj>你啥意思啊  你放弃我了吗
<2-12,Raj>Wh-What are you saying, that y-you're giving up on me?

82
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,500
<2-12,Raj>什么样的爸爸会放弃自己的儿子啊
<2-12,Raj>What kind of father gives up on his son?

83
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,940
<2-13,Dr Koothrapalli>我有六个孩子
<2-13,Dr Koothrapalli>I have six children,

84
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,380
<2-13,Dr Koothrapalli>其中五个都已婚  而且能养活自己
<2-13,Dr Koothrapalli>five of whom are married and self-sufficient.

85
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,550
<2-13,Dr Koothrapalli>我想问题应该不在我身上
<2-13,Dr Koothrapalli>I don't think I'm the problem.

86
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,130
<2-14,Raj>真不敢相信你会说这种话
<2-14,Raj>I can't believe what I'm hearing.

87
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,210
<2-14,Raj>太伤人家的小心肝了
<2-14,Raj>This is deeply hurtful.

88
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,640
<2-15,Dr Koothrapalli>你还是个玻璃心
<2-15,Dr Koothrapalli>You're also too sensitive.

89
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,670
<2-15,Dr Koothrapalli>女人也不喜欢这种男人
<2-15,Dr Koothrapalli>Women don't want that either.

90
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,710
<3-1,Amy>这里的餐点据说很好吃
<3-1,Amy>The food here's supposed to be great.

91
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,060
<3-1,Amy>别洋芋片吃饱了
<3-1,Amy>Don't fill up on chips.

92
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,780
<3-1,Amy>不会的  我有个小秘诀
<3-1,Amy>Oh, I won't. I have a trick.

93
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,920
<3-2,Sheldon>我只吃等边三角形的洋芋片
<3-2,Sheldon>I only eat equilateral triangles.

94
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,430
<3-2,Sheldon>等腰  等腰三角形
<3-2,Sheldon>Isosceles, isosceles,

95
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,820
<3-2,Sheldon>不等边三角形...
<3-2,Sheldon>oh, scalene...

96
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,980
<3-2,Sheldon>你没看到这幕
<3-2,Sheldon>You didn't see that.

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,230
<3-3,Amy>你看是伯特  在吧台那里
<3-3,Amy>Oh, look. It's Bert, at the bar.

98
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,900
<3-3,Amy>我们应该过去打个招呼
<3-3,Amy>We should go say hi.

99
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,270
<3-4,Sheldon>为什么
<3-4,Sheldon>Why?

100
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,210
<3-5,Amy>因为这是正常人
<3-5,Amy>Because that's what you do

101
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,350
<3-5,Amy>在公共场合看到认识的人时该做的举动
<3-5,Amy>when you see someone you know in a public place.

102
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,200
<3-6,Sheldon>我有好几张限制令证明不是这样
<3-6,Sheldon>I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.

103
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,600
<3-7,Amy>谢尔顿  跟朋友打个招呼与
<3-7,Amy>Sheldon, there's a difference between greeting a friend

104
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,320
<3-7,Amy>跟踪名人进厕所是有区别的
<3-7,Amy>and following a celebrity into a bathroom.

105
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,730
<3-8,Sheldon>连法官都不能跟我解释通
<3-8,Sheldon>If the judge couldn't explain it to me,

106
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,850
<3-8,Sheldon>你凭什么觉得你行呢
<3-8,Sheldon>I don't see how you will.

107
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,080
<3-9,Amy>-伯特  -你好
<3-9,Amy>- Hi, Bert. - Hello.

<3-11,Bert>你们好呀
<3-11,Bert>Oh, hey, guys.

109
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,390
<3-11,Bert>你们怎么会在这里

<3-12,Amy>-我们是来约会的  -不错嘛
<3-12,Amy>- Oh, we're having date night. - Nice.

<3-14,Amy>Oh, really. Anybody we know?

113
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,590
<3-15,Bert>应该不是  我们是在天地合网上认识的
<3-15,Bert>I doubt it. I met her on G-Harmony.

114
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,460
<3-15,Bert>那是专门为地质学家创立的婚恋网站
<3-15,Bert>That's a Web site for geologists to find love.

115
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,900
<3-16,Amy>还真有这种网站啊
<3-16,Amy>That's a real thing?

116
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,960
<3-17,Bert>当然  他们的口号是"合时为你安排约会
<3-17,Bert>Yeah. Their slogan is "we're all about dating

117
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,730
<3-17,Bert>而非用碳14测何时"
<3-17,Bert>and not the carbon-14 kind."

119
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,460
<3-18,Sheldon>祝你们有个美好的夜晚
<3-18,Sheldon>Well, have a lovely evening.

<3-19,Bert>谢谢  你们也一样
<3-19,Bert>Thanks. You, too.

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,730
<3-20,Sheldon>如果你觉得这样比跟明星扎克瑞·昆图
<3-20,Sheldon>If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto

122
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,670
<3-20,Sheldon>隔着厕所门说话更有意思  那你真是疯了
<3-20,Sheldon>through a stall door, you're crazy.

123
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,740
<4-1,Penny>其实我们可以去你们家
<4-1,Penny>You know, we could've come to you guys.

124
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,060
<4-1,Penny>这样就不用把宝宝带过来了啦
<4-1,Penny>You didn't have to bring the baby here.

125
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,920
<4-2,Bernadette>没关系  走出家门的感觉真好
<4-2,Bernadette>Oh, it's okay. It's good to get out of the house.

126
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,410
<4-3,Howard>而且她一坐车就乖乖睡觉
<4-3,Howard>And the car ride puts her to sleep.

127
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,900
<4-4,Leonard>以前这招对谢尔顿也管用
<4-4,Leonard>Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.

128
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,350
<4-5,Penny>是啊  直到某人把他扔在药店的停车场
<4-5,Penny>Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot

129
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,330
<4-5,Penny>让他吓了个半死
<4-5,Penny>and he freaked out.

130
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,920
<4-6,Leonard>是谁忘了把车窗留一点缝
<4-6,Leonard>Who forgot to crack the window?

131
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,050
<4-8,Leonard>你们好呀
<4-8,Leonard>Hello!

132
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,310
<4-9,Penny>有人去古奇购物了
<4-9,Penny>Someone's been shopping at Gucci.

133
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,460
<4-10,Raj>是啊  我觉得超适合哈雷就忍不住买了
<4-10,Raj>Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn't resist.

134
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
<4-11,Bernadette>你真是太好了
<4-11,Bernadette>That's so sweet of you.

135
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,000
<4-12,Raj>是压皱天鹅绒宝宝斗篷哦
<4-12,Raj>Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.

136
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,640
<4-13,Howard>不是吧  现在我们有两件了
<4-13,Howard>Oh, no, now we have two.

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,780
<4-14,Penny>-一定很贵吧  -是啊
<4-14,Penny>- That must've been expensive. - Yeah, it was.

138
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,160
<4-15,Raj>但花的是我老爹的钱  反正我也不爽他
<4-15,Raj>But it's my father's money and I'm mad at him.

139
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,520
<4-16,Leonard>你跟你爸怎么了
<4-16,Leonard>What's going on with your dad?

140
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,750
<4-17,Penny>如果你真的想惹毛他
<4-17,Penny>And if you really want to hurt him,

141
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,240
<4-17,Penny>我穿香奈儿可好看了
<4-17,Penny>I look great in Chanel.

142
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,360
<4-18,Raj>我才发现他根本不在乎我结婚还是单身
<4-18,Raj>It turns out he doesn't care if I'm married or if I'm single.

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
<4-18,Raj>他基本已经放弃我了
<4-18,Raj>He's basically given up on me.

144
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,110
<4-19,Bernadette>我敢说一定不是真的
<4-19,Bernadette>Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

145
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,390
<4-20,Raj>是真的  他不再帮我找印度姑娘逼我成亲了
<4-20,Raj>It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.

146
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,510
<4-21,Leonard>你爸这么做时  你也只是一昧抱怨啊
<4-21,Leonard>All you did was complain when he did that.

147
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,960
<4-22,Penny>莱纳德  他正伤心呢  让他发泄
<4-22,Penny>Leonard, he's hurting. Let him feel how he feels.

148
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,140
<4-23,Raj>-多谢体谅  佩妮  -不客气
<4-23,Raj>- Thank you, Penny. - Yeah.

<4-24,Penny>我鞋子穿7码半  靴子穿8码
<4-24,Penny>Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half; boots, I'm an eight.

<5-1,Sheldon>你呢
<5-1,Sheldon>You?

157
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,560
<5-2,Amy>抱歉  我没有需要怀念的过气搜索引擎列表
<5-2,Amy>Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.

158
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,880
<5-3,Bert>看来我被人放鸽子了
<5-3,Bert>Hey. Looks like I got stood up,

159
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,900
<5-3,Bert>-所以我还是走吧  -别啊
<5-3,Bert>- so I'm gonna head out. - Oh, no.

160
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,080
<5-4,Amy>你确定不再多等她几分钟吗
<5-4,Amy>Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?

161
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,280
<5-5,Bert>不了  天地合网的建议等待时间是两小时
<5-5,Bert>Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours,

162
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,130
<5-5,Bert>是时候该放弃了
<5-5,Bert>it's time to cut bait.

163
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,870
<5-6,Amy>我感到很遗憾
<5-6,Amy>I'm so sorry.

164
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,080
<5-7,Sheldon>伯特  请你加入我们吧
<5-7,Sheldon>Bert, I insist that you join us.

165
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,460
<5-8,Bert>你真的不介意吗
<5-8,Bert>You really wouldn't mind?

166
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,100
<5-9,Sheldon>完全不会  艾米你呢
<5-9,Sheldon>Not at all. Amy?

167
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,330
<5-10,Amy>我也不介意
<5-10,Amy>Fine with me.

168
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,180
<5-11,Bert>谢谢  那我去拿把椅子
<5-11,Bert>Thanks. I'll go grab a chair.

169
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,330
<5-12,Amy>谢尔顿  你的举动真是太暖了
<5-12,Amy>Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.

170
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,290
<5-13,Sheldon>我从他的脸部表情和肢体语言
<5-13,Sheldon>Well, I could deduce by his facial expression

171
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,210
<5-13,Sheldon>推断出他很难过
<5-13,Sheldon>and body language that he was sad.

172
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,000
<5-14,Amy>他说自己被人放鸽子时没有给你点提示吗
<5-14,Amy>So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?

173
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,300
<5-15,Sheldon>你还指望我会一边观察他  一边听他的废话吗
<5-15,Sheldon>You want me to look at him and listen to him?

174
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,680
<6-1,Raj>我父亲觉得我的每段感情之所以不成功
<6-1,Raj>My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work

175
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,080
<6-1,Raj>是因为我是被宠坏的屁孩
<6-1,Raj>is because I'm spoiled.

176
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,650
<6-2,Leonard>抱歉  他是在等着有人提出反对意见吗
<6-2,Leonard>I'm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?

177
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,480
<6-3,Raj>就因为他帮我解决问题
<6-3,Raj>Just because he helps me out

178
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,740
<6-3,Raj>并不意味着我被他宠坏了
<6-3,Raj>doesn't automatically mean that I'm spoiled.

179
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,300
<6-4,Penny>好吧  那他到底帮你解决多少账单
<6-4,Penny>All right, how much exactly does he pay for?

180
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,210
<6-5,Raj>我会告诉你们
<6-5,Raj>Okay, I'll tell you,

181
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,970
<6-5,Raj>但请不要鄙视我
<6-5,Raj>but please don't judge me.

182
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,150
<6-5,Raj>我的车  我的房租和信用卡的账单都是他付的
<6-5,Raj>He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.

183
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,380
<6-6,Leonard>我在努力忍住  但我已经鄙视你了
<6-6,Leonard>I'm trying, but I'm judging.

184
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,130
<6-7,Howard>或许你爸说得对
<6-7,Howard>Maybe your dad's right.

185
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,380
<6-8,Penny>对啊  女人的确喜欢能养活自己的男人
<6-8,Penny>Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.

186
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,290
<6-9,Raj>但伯纳黛特挣的钱比霍华德多
<6-9,Raj>But Bernadette makes more money than Howard.

187
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,550
<6-9,Raj>基本是她在养活自己老公啊
<6-9,Raj>She basically supports him.

188
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,200
<6-10,Bernadette>是啊  或许你爸是对的
<6-10,Bernadette>Yeah, maybe your dad's right.

189
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,090
<7-1,Bert>好问题  我想想
<7-1,Bert>Good question. Let's see.

<7-4,Sheldon>其实我们是在网上认识的
<7-4,Sheldon>Actually, we met online.

199
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,440
<7-5,Amy>我们第一次约会是在一家咖啡馆
<7-5,Amy>Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.

200
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,900
<7-6,Sheldon>不过跟你的约会对象不一样  她可是真来了
<7-6,Sheldon>Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.

201
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,970
<7-6,Sheldon>他又看起来难过了
<7-6,Sheldon>Oh, he looks sad again.

202
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,050
<7-7,Bert>我真的很羡慕你们的感情
<7-7,Bert>Well, I really envy your relationship.

203
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,320
<7-7,Bert>除了你们俩一年只做一次爱这点
<7-7,Bert>Other than you two only having sex once a year,

204
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,760
<7-7,Bert>你们简直是完美情侣档
<7-7,Bert>you're the perfect couple.

205
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,410
<7-8,Amy>你知道这件事吗
<7-8,Amy>You-you know about that?

206
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,630
<7-9,Bert>整个大学谁不知道呀
<7-9,Bert>Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.

207
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,780
<7-10,Amy>你知道这件事吗
<7-10,Amy>Were you aware of this?

208
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,670
<7-11,Sheldon>不  这事我只告诉过莱纳德  霍华德  拉杰
<7-11,Sheldon>No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,

209
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,270
<7-11,Sheldon>克里普克  吴教授  克莱因教授
<7-11,Sheldon>Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein,

210
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,090
<7-11,Sheldon>还有一个食堂大妈
<7-11,Sheldon>and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.

211
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,110
<7-11,Sheldon>我也想不通其他人是怎么知道的
<7-11,Sheldon>How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.

212
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,960
<8-1,Sheldon>你为什么不理我了
<8-1,Sheldon>Why aren't you talking to me?

213
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,400
<8-2,Amy>因为我对你很生气
<8-2,Amy>Because I'm mad at you.

214
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,420
<8-3,Sheldon>现在我后悔问了这个问题
<8-3,Sheldon>Well, now I'm sorry I asked.

215
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,130
<8-4,Amy>谢尔顿  我的脸都丢完了
<8-4,Amy>Sheldon, it's humiliating.

216
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,270
<8-4,Amy>因为你  我的同事们都在八卦我们的性生活
<8-4,Amy>Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.

217
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,800
<8-5,Sheldon>这有什么可八卦的呀
<8-5,Sheldon>What is there to gossip about?

218
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,330
<8-5,Sheldon>我们都没做过几次
<8-5,Sheldon>We barely have one.

219
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,800
<8-6,Amy>所以他们才感兴趣呀
<8-6,Amy>That's why they're doing it!

220
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,940
<8-7,Sheldon>我可以理解为你再也不想和我说话了吗
<8-7,Sheldon>Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again?

221
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,650
<8-7,Sheldon>如果你是因为不想理我所以不回答
<8-7,Sheldon>If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me,

222
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,320
<8-7,Sheldon>也许我们可以用某种信号来表示
<8-7,Sheldon>perhaps we could come up with a signal!

223
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,500
<8-7,Sheldon>我懂了
<8-7,Sheldon>That works!

224
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,510
<9-1,Howard>你才不需要你爸的钱
<9-1,Howard>You don't need your dad's money.

225
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,790
<9-1,Howard>-你的收入足够养活你自己了  -没错
<9-1,Howard>- You can get by on your salary. - Yeah.

226
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,560
<9-2,Leonard>我们和你一样都在学校工作
<9-2,Leonard>Well, we work at the same place as you, and

227
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,300
<9-2,Leonard>-我们就活得挺好  -得了吧
<9-2,Leonard>- we've always been fine. - Oh, please.

228
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,130
<9-3,Raj>拜托照照镜子  你俩看起来比我老十岁
<9-3,Raj>Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.

229
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,150
<9-3,Raj>好吧
<9-3,Raj>All right.

230
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,460
<9-4,Penny>等等  我们一定有办法解决的
<9-4,Penny>Hang on. We can figure this out.

231
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,530
<9-4,Penny>我们先清理一下你的开销  你每月房租多少
<9-4,Penny>Let's just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?

232
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,770
<9-5,Raj>我不想回答
<9-5,Raj>I don't want to say.

233
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,770
<9-6,Bernadette>高到特别离谱吗
<9-6,Bernadette>Is it really that high?

234
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,920
<9-7,Raj>我不想回答因为我不知道多少钱
<9-7,Raj>I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.

235
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,770
<9-8,Penny>你连自己的房租都不知道吗
<9-8,Penny>You don't how much your rent is?

236
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,960
<9-9,Raj>我爸帮我付房租啦  你知道你的房租多少钱吗
<9-9,Raj>My father pays for it! Do you know how much your rent is?!

237
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,640
<9-10,Penny>当然知道
<9-10,Penny>Yeah.

238
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,420
<9-11,Raj>那就按你房租的两倍算吧
<9-11,Raj>Well, then double it,

239
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,910
<9-11,Raj>我的房子比你这垃圾堆舒服多了
<9-11,Raj>because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.

240
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,150
<9-12,Leonard>那你知道每个月养车要多少钱吗
<9-12,Leonard>Do you know how much your car costs?

241
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,060
<9-13,Raj>不知道
<9-13,Raj>Not really.

242
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,720
<9-14,Howard>每个月吃饭要多少钱
<9-14,Howard>Well, how much do you spend on food?

243
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,380
<9-15,Raj>吃的全是家政工负责买好
<9-15,Raj>The housekeeper does the shopping.

244
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,910
<9-16,Bernadette>我的乖乖  你真是被宠坏了
<9-16,Bernadette>Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.

245
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,850
<9-16,Bernadette>我被宠坏了
<9-16,Bernadette>I'm spoiled?!

248
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,770
<10-2,Sheldon>等一下
<10-2,Sheldon>Well, wait.

249
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,230
<10-2,Sheldon>这是我们同居之后第一次吵架
<10-2,Sheldon>This is our first fight as a couple who live together.

250
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,510
<10-3,Amy>所以呢
<10-3,Amy>So?

251
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,430
<10-4,Sheldon>我对这种事的规矩还不太懂
<10-4,Sheldon>I'm not sure of the protocol.

252
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,560
<10-4,Sheldon>电视里教的是
<10-4,Sheldon>Television teaches us

253
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,250
<10-4,Sheldon>这种情况下男的应该去睡沙发
<10-4,Sheldon>that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch,

254
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,360
<10-4,Sheldon>但我们当中明显是你的体型更适合睡沙发
<10-4,Sheldon>but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.

255
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,020
<10-5,Amy>我才不会为了
<10-5,Amy>I'm not sleeping on the couch

256
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,700
<10-5,Amy>你不懂什么叫私事而滚去睡沙发
<10-5,Amy>'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.

257
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,320
<10-6,Sheldon>这不公平
<10-6,Sheldon>This isn't fair.

258
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,710
<10-6,Sheldon>你还不是和佩妮
<10-6,Sheldon>You've discussed aspects

259
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,530
<10-6,Sheldon>讨论过我俩的肉体关系
<10-6,Sheldon>of our physical relationship with Penny.

260
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,140
<10-7,Amy>那不一样
<10-7,Amy>That's different!

261
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,590
<10-7,Amy>她是我的闺蜜  不是你那位
<10-7,Amy>She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria

262
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,370
<10-7,Amy>帮三明治去面包皮的食堂大妈
<10-7,Amy>who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!

263
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,250
<10-8,Sheldon>人家大妈也是有名字的
<10-8,Sheldon>That lady has a name.

264
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,410
<10-8,Sheldon>虽然我不知道她的芳名
<10-8,Sheldon>I don't know what it is,

265
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,580
<10-8,Sheldon>但有一次  我不小心喊了她一声妈
<10-8,Sheldon>but one time, I accidentally called her mom?

266
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,950
<11-1,Leonard>看来你得先搬去便宜的地方住了
<11-1,Leonard>Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.

267
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,630
<11-2,Bernadette>你刚来这里时也没多少钱
<11-2,Bernadette>When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.

268
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,930
<11-2,Bernadette>你是怎么过下来的
<11-2,Bernadette>How'd you get by?

269
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,980
<11-3,Penny>有时候你可以从邻居那里蹭到
<11-3,Penny>Well, sometimes you can get free food

270
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,130
<11-3,Penny>免费的食物和网络
<11-3,Penny>and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.

271
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,540
<11-3,Penny>只不过
<11-3,Penny>Just know

272
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,290
<11-3,Penny>最后你可能得嫁给其中的一个人
<11-3,Penny>you might have to marry one of 'em.

273
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,810
<11-4,Leonard>对了  斯图尔特都住在你们家了
<11-4,Leonard>Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.

274
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,550
<11-4,Leonard>不如也让拉杰一起住吧
<11-4,Leonard>Why not Raj, too?

275
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,350
<11-5,Howard>你这是在干嘛呀  我...
<11-5,Howard>What-what are you doing? I...

276
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,390
<11-5,Howard>我拖着孩子来你家聚会  还带了进口啤酒
<11-5,Howard>I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer.

277
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,520
<11-5,Howard>你为什么还不喜欢我
<11-5,Howard>Why don't you like me?

278
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,860
<11-6,Raj>拜托  我以为我俩是好朋友呢
<11-6,Raj>Well, I thought we were best friends!

279
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,800
<11-7,Howard>我们是呀
<11-7,Howard>We are!

280
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,660
<11-7,Howard>一想到好朋友将要无家可归  我真伤心难过
<11-7,Howard>That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.

281
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,240
<11-8,Bernadette>抱歉  拉杰  我们家真的没地方了
<11-8,Bernadette>I'm sorry, Raj. We really just don't have the space.

282
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,810
<11-9,Leonard>不如让他住你家车库吧
<11-9,Leonard>What if he lives in your garage?

283
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,260
<11-10,Bernadette>不如你丫赶紧闭嘴吧
<11-10,Bernadette>What if you stop helping?!

284
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,630
<11-11,Raj>各位  我才不要住车库呢
<11-11,Raj>Guys, I'm not living in a garage!

285
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,500
<11-12,Howard>等等  干嘛总纠结我的房子呢
<11-12,Howard>Wait. Why are we talking about our place

286
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,780
<11-12,Howard>谢尔顿的房间明明还空着呀
<11-12,Howard>when Sheldon's old room is sitting there perfectly empty?

287
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,560
<11-13,Bernadette>这个主意不错
<11-13,Bernadette>That's a great idea.

288
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,850
<11-14,Penny>拉杰  如果你需要地方住
<11-14,Penny>Raj, if you need a place to stay,

289
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,570
<11-14,Penny>我们家永远为你敞开
<11-14,Penny>of course you are welcome here.

290
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,960
<11-15,Raj>谢了  但如果我要给朋友添麻烦的话
<11-15,Raj>Thank you, but if I'm gonna just take advantage of my friends,

291
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,840
<11-15,Raj>我还不如继续靠我爹养着呢
<11-15,Raj>I might as well keep on relying on my father.

292
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,940
<11-16,Penny>好吧  你决定了就好
<11-16,Penny>Okay, only if you're sure.

293
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,050
<11-16,Penny>好险
<11-16,Penny>Whew.

294
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,250
<11-16,Penny>万幸
<11-16,Penny>Yeah.

295
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,020
<12-1,Sheldon>艾米
<12-1,Sheldon>Amy?

296
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,290
<12-1,Sheldon>艾米
<12-1,Sheldon>Amy?

297
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,010
<12-1,Sheldon>-艾米  -干嘛
<12-1,Sheldon>- Amy? - Yeah?

298
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,090
<12-3,Sheldon>虽然你口气不善  但也行吧
<12-3,Sheldon>Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.

299
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,770
<12-4,Amy>这是什么
<12-4,Amy>What is this?

300
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,670
<12-5,Sheldon>我画了一张图  列出了和谁
<12-5,Sheldon>I'm mapping basic topics of conversation

301
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,780
<12-5,Sheldon>应该讨论什么样的话题
<12-5,Sheldon>and with whom they can be discussed.

302
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,530
<12-5,Sheldon>我管这些圆圈叫"隐私地带"
<12-5,Sheldon>I call these circles Zones of Privacy.

303
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,600
<12-5,Sheldon>别搜索这个词
<12-5,Sheldon>Don't Google that

304
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,870
<12-5,Sheldon>除非你想看人类性器官的图片
<12-5,Sheldon>unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.

305
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,090
<12-5,Sheldon>这个圈里只有我和你
<12-5,Sheldon>This circle contains only me and you.

306
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,080
<12-5,Sheldon>代表我们只跟对方分享的话题
<12-5,Sheldon>It represents subjects we only share with each other--

307
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,870
<12-5,Sheldon>身体亲密行为的细节  如厕习惯
<12-5,Sheldon>details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.

308
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,800
<12-5,Sheldon>不过说着说着
<12-5,Sheldon>Although, as I'm saying it,

309
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,550
<12-5,Sheldon>我觉得有必要加上芬克医生
<12-5,Sheldon>I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.

310
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:06,820
<12-6,Amy>你真的担心
<12-6,Amy>Are you really worried

311
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,630
<12-6,Amy>向史蒂芬·霍金透露秘密吗
<12-6,Amy>about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?

312
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,380
<12-7,Sheldon>不  我只是很兴奋能将他列为好友
<12-7,Sheldon>No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.

313
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,600
<12-8,Amy>谢谢你为我做这些
<12-8,Amy>Well, I do appreciate you working on this.

314
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,020
<12-9,Sheldon>对不起我让你觉得丢脸了
<12-9,Sheldon>I'm sorry you were embarrassed.

315
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,680
<12-9,Sheldon>现在我懂了
<12-9,Sheldon>And now I understand that

316
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,450
<12-9,Sheldon>有些事只能你知我知
<12-9,Sheldon>some things are just between you and me,

317
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,560
<12-9,Sheldon>万一有红肿和肿胀  芬克医生也要知
<12-9,Sheldon>and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.

318
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,070
<12-10,Amy>中间那个小点是什么
<12-10,Amy>What's that little dot in the middle?

319
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,250
<12-11,Sheldon>那是我不与任何人分享的想法
<12-11,Sheldon>That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone.

320
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,680
<12-12,Amy>有意思
<12-12,Amy>Interesting.

321
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,430
<12-12,Amy>你真有没告诉我的秘密吗
<12-12,Amy>You really have secrets you don't tell me?

322
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,110
<12-13,Sheldon>当然有
<12-13,Sheldon>Of course.

323
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,560
<12-14,Amy>可以说一个听听吗
<12-14,Amy>Can I hear one?

324
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,240
<12-15,Sheldon>不行  这是隐私
<12-15,Sheldon>No, they're private.

325
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,220
<12-16,Amy>为什么  是很"不乖"的吗
<12-16,Amy>Why? Are they naughty?

326
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,200
<12-17,Sheldon>一点点吧
<12-17,Sheldon>A little.

327
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,500
<12-18,Amy>求你了
<12-18,Amy>Please?

328
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,470
<12-18,Amy>好
<12-18,Amy>Fine.

329
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,550
<12-19,Sheldon>两年前...
<12-19,Sheldon>Two years ago...

330
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,750
<12-19,Sheldon>我拿到了驾照
<12-19,Sheldon>...I got my driver's license.

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,090
<13-1,Dr Koothrapalli (on skype)>什么
<13-1,Dr Koothrapalli (on skype)>What?!

332
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,790
<12-20,Amy>你为什么没说
<12-20,Amy>Why didn't you say anything?!

333
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,630
<12-21,Sheldon>我喜欢有司机接送
<12-21,Sheldon>I like being chauffeured around.

334
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,180
<12-21,Sheldon>这让我觉得自己是大人物
<12-21,Sheldon>It makes me feel important.

335
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,780
<12-22,Amy>我清晨四点起来  送你穿越沙漠
<12-22,Amy>So when I got up at 4:00 A.M. to drive you across the desert

336
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,770
<12-22,Amy>去古董火车博物馆  其实不必我去吗
<12-22,Amy>to an antique train museum, I didn't have to?

337
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,280
<12-23,Sheldon>是  你不必
<12-23,Sheldon>No, you didn't.

338
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,220
<12-23,Sheldon>但你记得
<12-23,Sheldon>But keep in mind,

339
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,680
<12-23,Sheldon>那让我觉得自己是超级大人物
<12-23,Sheldon>I felt extremely important.

352
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,260
<13-8,Raj>你的欣喜与宽慰毁了我的计划
<13-8,Raj>and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,000
<13-8,Raj>抱歉

<14-5,Sheldon>that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler

369
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,710

<14-5,Sheldon>on the advancement of human knowledge,

374
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,770
<14-5,Sheldon>而不是其他人的私生活细节
<14-5,Sheldon>not the intimate details of other people's lives.

375
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,580
<14-5,Sheldon>他说得对

<14-7,Sheldon>令你蒙羞的女人  真是走宝了
<14-7,Sheldon>and humiliated you last night really missed out.

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,390
<14-8,Bert>这样说可建立不了我的光辉形象
<14-8,Bert>That doesn't paint me in the best light.

<14-9,Sheldon>这样啊  对不起
<14-9,Sheldon>Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

<14-9,Sheldon>Correction: That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert...

383
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,920
<14-9,Sheldon>而且还因为他活儿好  给了一块钱小费
<14-9,Sheldon>she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.

384
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,100
<14-10,Bert>-光辉起来了吗  -没有
<14-10,Bert>- That better? - Not really.

387
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,090
<14-11,Sheldon>还有  想寻欢作乐  就找伯特
<14-11,Sheldon>and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.

388
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,530
<14-12,Leonard>这是唱的哪一出
<14-12,Leonard>What brought that on?

389

<14-13,Sheldon>昨晚艾米生气了

390
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,510
<14-13,Sheldon>因为我傻里傻气地告诉别人
<14-13,Sheldon>because I'd been foolishly telling people

391
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,350
<14-13,Sheldon>某些隐私事情
<14-13,Sheldon>about certain personal matters.

392
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,020
<14-14,Howard>生气是正常的
<14-14,Howard>That's understandable.

393
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,510
<14-15,Sheldon>我现在知道了
<14-15,Sheldon>Oh, I know that now.

394
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,310
<14-15,Sheldon>起初  我以为她脾气暴躁
<14-15,Sheldon>At first, I thought she was cranky

395
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,410
<14-15,Sheldon>是因为她很严重的经痛  但是
<14-15,Sheldon>because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but...

396
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,310
<14-15,Sheldon>结果不是  她只是真的觉得丢人
<14-15,Sheldon>...it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.
