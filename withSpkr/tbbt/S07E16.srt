1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,040
<1-1,Howard>我在考虑留个山羊胡
<1-1,Howard>I'm thinking about growing a goatee.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,570
<1-2,Raj>你那样是范·戴克式胡
<1-2,Raj>Oh, actually that's a Van Dyke.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,410
<1-2,Raj>山羊胡的话就只留下巴处
<1-2,Raj>A goatee is just hair on the chin.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,480
<1-3,Leonard>等等  那如果是只有上面这块的胡须呢
<1-3,Leonard>Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
<1-4,Raj>你是指笑虎子吗
<1-4,Raj>You mean a moustache?

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,600
<1-6,Howard>-"笑虎子"  -他那么念啦
<1-6,Howard>- Moo-stache! - He said it!

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,020
<1-7,Raj>笑吧笑吧  随便取笑外国来的吧
<1-7,Raj>Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy.

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,990
<1-7,Raj>印度人口可是比美国人口多四倍
<1-7,Raj>For your information, there are four times as many

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,720
<1-7,Raj>所以我们念的才是大众标准
<1-7,Raj>Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,990
<1-4,Raj>-所以怎么念  -笑虎子[小胡子]
<1-4,Raj>- Say what? - Moo-stache.

12
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,540
<1-5,Leonard>-笑虎子  -他念成笑虎子
<1-5,Leonard>- Moo-stache! - He said "Moo-stache"

13
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,630
<1-12,Bernadette>你们两个太幼稚了
<1-12,Bernadette>Guys, you're being childish.

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,430
<1-13,Sheldon>她说得没错  你们都是大人了
<1-13,Sheldon>Yeah, she's right. You're grown men,

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,930
<1-13,Sheldon>所谓大人就是指
<1-13,Sheldon>the kind who are perfectly capable

16
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,890
<1-13,Sheldon>能留出笑虎子的人
<1-13,Sheldon>of growing your own moo-staches.

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,440
<1-14,Amy>你是讲笑话  不是无意中被笑  干得好
<1-14,Amy>Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,710
<1-15,Penny>抱歉迟到了  我去试镜耽搁了
<1-15,Penny>Hi. Sorry I'm late-- I was at an audition.

19
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,540
<1-17,Sheldon>-我也很遗憾  -下次会选上的
<1-17,Sheldon>- Oh, I'm sorry. - You'll get 'em next time.

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,710
<1-18,Penny>你们能不要直接认为我失败了
<1-18,Penny>How about instead of assuming I failed,

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,200
<1-18,Penny>-而是问我结果如何吗  -抱歉
<1-18,Penny>- you ask me how it went? - Sorry.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,130
<1-19,Leonard>-那结果如何  -问屁啊
<1-19,Leonard>- How did it go? - Just shut up.

23
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,450
<1-21,Raj>来  坐你的位子吧
<1-21,Raj>Here, you can have your seat.

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,640
<1-22,Penny>不用不用  你坐吧  我坐地上无所谓的
<1-22,Penny>No, no, no, stay there. I'm fine on the floor.

25
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,470
<1-23,Bernadette>你们有想过这里搞张餐桌吗
<1-23,Bernadette>Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?

26
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,970
<1-24,Amy>其实那边有位置放张餐桌呢
<1-24,Amy>Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.

27
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,830
<1-25,Raj>行啊  我坐地板上几年了也无人心疼
<1-25,Raj>Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares.

28
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,310
<1-25,Raj>漂亮的白人妞才坐个十秒
<1-25,Raj>The pretty white girl's there ten seconds,

29
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,970
<1-25,Raj>大家就要杀到宜家买餐桌了
<1-25,Raj>and suddenly we're all running to IKEA.

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,940
<1-26,Sheldon>大家哪也不杀去
<1-26,Sheldon>No one is running anywhere.

31
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,900
<1-26,Sheldon>我们没有要买新餐桌
<1-26,Sheldon>We're not getting a dining room table.

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,310
<1-27,Leonard>我知道你不喜欢改变
<1-27,Leonard>I know you don't like change,

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,890
<1-27,Leonard>但其实这主意不错啊
<1-27,Leonard>but it's not a terrible idea.

34
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,780
<1-28,Penny>你们那块空间平常也只是闲置
<1-28,Penny>Yeah, you guys never use that space up there.

35
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,570
<1-28,Penny>何不搞张餐桌呢
<1-28,Penny>Why not get a table?

36
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,880
<1-29,Sheldon>你想要听长答案还是短答案
<1-29,Sheldon>Do you want the long answer or the short answer?

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,400
<1-30,Howard>为啥我们平常都没这福利呢
<1-30,Howard>Hey, how come we never get that option?

38
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,120
<1-31,Sheldon>混沌理论认为  即使在一个确定系统中
<1-31,Sheldon>Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system,

39
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,190
<1-31,Sheldon>如果描述该系统变化的方程式为非线性的
<1-31,Sheldon>if the equations describing its behavior are nonlinear,

40
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,440
<1-31,Sheldon>那么初始条件最微小的改变
<1-31,Sheldon>a tiny change in the initial conditions

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,920
<1-31,Sheldon>也可能引起灾难性的无法预计的后果
<1-31,Sheldon>can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,220
<1-32,Penny>翻译一下
<1-32,Penny>Translation?

43
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,470

<2-1,Leonard>Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table.

<2-1,Leonard>你要一起来吗
<2-1,Leonard>You want to come with us?

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,810
<2-2,Sheldon>我当然愿意
<2-2,Sheldon>You know, I'd love to,

53

<2-2,Sheldon>but, um, I'm too busy

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,880
<2-2,Sheldon>正忙着再爱Win98一遍呢
<2-2,Sheldon>falling back in love with Windows 98.

55
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,580
<2-3,Leonard>你不是吧  你都几年没用过这桌子了
<2-3,Leonard>Seriously? You haven't used this desk in years.

56
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,670
<2-3,Leonard>我刚想要把它弄走  你就跑回来鼓捣东西
<2-3,Leonard>The second I want to get rid of it, you're up here working?

57
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,150
<2-4,Sheldon>我现在没空跟你聊
<2-4,Sheldon>I can't talk right now--

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,660
<2-4,Sheldon>我还得安装几千个更新包呢
<2-4,Sheldon>I have several thousand updates to install.

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,700
<2-5,Leonard>你真要在这赖着一整天吗
<2-5,Leonard>Are you really gonna sit here all day?

60
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,400
<2-6,Sheldon>把我想成是《银河系漫游指南》中的亚瑟·丹特
<2-6,Sheldon>Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

61
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,770
<2-6,Sheldon>躺在家的前面阻止房子被推倒
<2-6,Sheldon>lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.

62
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,530
<2-7,Leonard>那你记得  渥罡人最后还是把地球全炸了吗
<2-7,Leonard>If you'll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.

63
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,850
<2-8,Sheldon>这就是本科幻小说  莱纳德
<2-8,Sheldon>It's a made-up story, Leonard--

64
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,950
<2-8,Sheldon>我不懂你聊这个是要干嘛
<2-8,Sheldon>I don't even know why you're talking about it.

65
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,430
<2-9,Leonard>我要把这些东西都放储藏室去
<2-9,Leonard>I'm putting all this stuff in storage.

66
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,490
<2-9,Leonard>全都是没用的东西
<2-9,Leonard>We don't need any of it.

67
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,540
<2-10,Sheldon>你  你怎么能这么说
<2-10,Sheldon>You... How can you say that?

68
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,850
<2-10,Sheldon>哪件是生活中不必要的你指给我看看
<2-10,Sheldon>You show me one thing in here we can live without.

69
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,750
<2-11,Leonard>稍等
<2-11,Leonard>Oh, hang on.

<2-11,Leonard>去你的收件箱看吧
<2-11,Leonard>Check your in-box.

71
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,240
<2-12,Sheldon>别走  这么做真值得吗
<2-12,Sheldon>Wait. Is this really worth it?

72
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,500
<2-12,Sheldon>我们同住了这么多年
<2-12,Sheldon>We've lived together for years

73
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,900
<2-13,Leonard>从来没有过争执
<2-13,Leonard>with nary an argument. Huh?

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
<2-14,Sheldon>但现在就为了张桌子
<2-14,Sheldon>But we start talking about a table,

75
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,210
<2-14,Sheldon>我们却突然开始掐架了
<2-14,Sheldon>and suddenly we're at each other's throats.

76
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,800
<2-15,Leonard>"从来没有过争执"吗
<2-15,Leonard>"Nary an argument"?

77
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,570
<2-15,Leonard>"从来"吗
<2-15,Leonard>"Nary"?!

78
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,710
<2-16,Sheldon>"从来"就是指连一次都没有
<2-16,Sheldon>Well, that means "not one," or "not any""

79
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,050
<2-16,Sheldon>你与其买桌子  还是买本辞典吧
<2-16,Sheldon>Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary.

80
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,110
<2-16,Sheldon>架我是不知道掐赢了没
<2-16,Sheldon>Well, I don't know if I won that,

81
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,130
<2-16,Sheldon>但至少膈应到他了
<2-16,Sheldon>but at least he's upset.

<3-4,Raj>伯纳黛特觉得这酷吗
<3-4,Raj>Did Bernadette think it was cool?

86
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,180
<3-5,Howard>我指着她脸说"静音"的时候肯定不觉得
<3-5,Howard>Not when I said "mute" and pointed it at her face.

<3-18,Raj>I'm just kidding.

116
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,450
<3-18,Raj>他会取我爷爷的名字  叫迪利卜
<3-18,Raj>We'll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.

<4-5,Penny>谢尔顿又不在这里

123
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,910
<4-6,Leonard>除非你愿意拿
<4-6,Leonard>So unless you want to dig him out

124
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,480
<4-6,Leonard>骨锯和挖球器来帮我挖出来
<4-6,Leonard>with a bone saw and a melon baller,

125
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,390
<4-6,Leonard>否则我也无能为力
<4-6,Leonard>there's nothing I can do about it.

126
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,350
<4-7,Penny>宝贝  这张桌子出钱的人是你
<4-7,Penny>All right, sweetie, you're paying for this table,

127
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,680
<4-7,Penny>公寓也是你们共有的
<4-7,Penny>and it's your apartment, too.

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,300
<4-8,Leonard>-我知道  但是...  -不许说但是
<4-8,Leonard>- I know, but... - No buts.

129
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,020
<4-9,Penny>你不能再让他对你颐指气使了
<4-9,Penny>You got to stop letting him boss you around.

130
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,560
<4-10,Leonard>有道理  每次都是他决定看什么电视节目
<4-10,Leonard>You're right. I mean, h-he decides what TV shows we watch,

131
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
<4-10,Leonard>吃什么东西  我最喜欢哪个霍比特人
<4-10,Leonard>what food we eat, who my favorite hobbit is--

132
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,330
<4-10,Leonard>我最喜欢弗罗多  但是他说不能重复
<4-10,Leonard>I wanted Frodo, but we can't both have Frodo,

133
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,100
<4-10,Leonard>你猜谁被逼去喜欢小肥仔山姆·詹吉了
<4-10,Leonard>so guess who's stuck with Samwise Gamgee.

135
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,100
<4-11,Penny>你看  活生生的例子  你是大人了
<4-11,Penny>See? Right there. You're a grown man,

136
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,670
<4-11,Penny>你有权选择自己最爱的霍比特人是哪个
<4-11,Penny>you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want.

137
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,060
<4-11,Penny>希望你没那么宅  但一次解决一问题吧
<4-11,Penny>Wish you wouldn't, but one problem at a time.

138
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,120
<4-12,Leonard>你的话很有道理
<4-12,Leonard>Y-You make a lot of sense.

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,750
<4-12,Leonard>我喜欢这张桌子  我要买了
<4-12,Leonard>I like this table, and I'm getting it.

140
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,950
<4-13,Penny>真的吗  这张啊
<4-13,Penny>Really? This one?

141
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,060
<4-14,Leonard>那张呢
<4-14,Leonard>That one?

142
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,900
<4-14,Leonard>爷他妈要的就是这张了
<4-14,Leonard>Damn right I like that one.

143
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,160
<5-2,Howard>有好消息宣布
<5-2,Howard>Good news.

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,020
<5-2,Howard>这房间里的某人能够"骑火箭升空"哦
<5-2,Howard>Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.

145
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,120
<5-3,Bernadette>好吧  我能至少先洗个澡吗
<5-3,Bernadette>Fine. Can I at least shower first?

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,050
<5-4,Howard>不是指那方面
<5-4,Howard>No, not that.

147
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,570
<5-4,Howard>但你答应了要骑我"火箭"也不许反悔
<5-4,Howard>Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.

148
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,240
<5-5,Bernadette>那你本来是指什么
<5-5,Bernadette>What are you talking about?

149
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,180
<5-6,Howard>先坐下
<5-6,Howard>Sit down.

150
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,350
<5-6,Howard>太空总署打来了
<5-6,Howard>NASA called.

151
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,310
<5-6,Howard>我之前给太空站
<5-6,Howard>The telescope mount I installed

152
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,900
<5-6,Howard>装的望远镜架坏了
<5-6,Howard>on the space station got damaged,

153
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,380
<5-6,Howard>他们现在想让我回去修好它
<5-6,Howard>and they want me to go back up and fix it.

154
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,400
<5-7,Bernadette>那你怎么回答
<5-7,Bernadette>Well, what did you say?

155
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,870
<5-8,Howard>你觉得呢  我当然十分乐意啊
<5-8,Howard>What do you think I...? I said yes!

156
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,320
<5-8,Howard>你干嘛看起来一脸惊讶
<5-8,Howard>Why do you look surprised?

157
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,020
<5-9,Bernadette>因为上次之后
<5-9,Bernadette>Well, it's just, after last time,

158
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,100
<5-9,Bernadette>我以为你不会再想重回太空
<5-9,Bernadette>I didn't think you'd ever want to go back.

159
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,950
<5-10,Howard>开什么玩笑
<5-10,Howard>Are you kidding?

160
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,230
<5-10,Howard>-上太空可是我这辈子最棒的体验  -是吗
<5-10,Howard>- It was the greatest experience of my life. - Really?

161
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,240
<5-11,Bernadette>我怎么记得有人在无穷无尽地抱怨
<5-11,Bernadette>'Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining

162
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,960
<5-11,Bernadette>哭爹喊娘盼着早日结束
<5-11,Bernadette>and wishing for it to be over.

163
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,860
<5-12,Howard>我觉得你说的是不是我
<5-12,Howard>I think you have me confused with

164
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,920
<5-12,Howard>而是等下洗完澡之后的你吧
<5-12,Howard>what's gonna happen when you get out of that shower.

165
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,400
<6-1,Leonard>桌子摆好了  你觉得怎么样
<6-1,Leonard>Hey, all set. What do you think?

166
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,970
<6-1,Leonard>人人都有座  不用挤在一起
<6-1,Leonard>There's plenty of room for everybody,

167
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,460
<6-1,Leonard>吃饭时还能欣赏窗外景色
<6-1,Leonard>a view out the window.

168
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,120
<6-2,Sheldon>我在沙发上的专座也能欣赏窗外景色
<6-2,Sheldon>My spot on the couch has a great view of a window.

169
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,760
<6-2,Sheldon>有时我还能看见太空大战呢
<6-2,Sheldon>Sometimes I can see space battles through it.

170
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,740
<6-2,Sheldon>那扇窗就叫电视
<6-2,Sheldon>It's called a TV.

171
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,550
<6-3,Penny>试试嘛  谢尔顿  没准你会喜欢呢
<6-3,Penny>Give it a chance, Sheldon; you might actually like it.

172
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,570
<6-4,Sheldon>你说得很对
<6-4,Sheldon>You're absolutely right.

173
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,170
<6-4,Sheldon>不喜欢
<6-4,Sheldon>Nope.

174
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,870
<6-5,Penny>他也算有"好好"试过一回了
<6-5,Penny>Well, you can't say he didn't give it a fair shot.

175
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,680
<6-6,Sheldon>那我们什么时候可以扔掉它
<6-6,Sheldon>So, when can we get rid of it?

176
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,070
<6-7,Leonard>才不扔呢
<6-7,Leonard>We're not.

177
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,880
<6-8,Sheldon>《室友协议》上是怎么规定的
<6-8,Sheldon>What about the roommate agreement?

178
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,270
<6-8,Sheldon>上面明确指出
<6-8,Sheldon>It specifically states

179
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,870
<6-8,Sheldon>凡是家具发生改动
<6-8,Sheldon>that any changes in furnishing

180
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,930
<6-8,Sheldon>都必须得经过家具委员会的同意
<6-8,Sheldon>have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee.

181
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,280
<6-8,Sheldon>而他们是隔年才开一次会
<6-8,Sheldon>Which only sits on alternate years.

182
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,440
<6-8,Sheldon>对了  顺便说一句
<6-8,Sheldon>Yeah, and by the way,

183
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,620
<6-8,Sheldon>委员会就坐[开会]这个位置
<6-8,Sheldon>it sits over there.

184
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,050
<6-9,Penny>-拜托  这规定太扯了吧  -她说得对
<6-9,Penny>- Come on, that is ridiculous. - She's right--

185
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,280
<6-10,Leonard>这么重要的委员会应该经常开会才对
<6-10,Leonard>a committee that important should meet more often.

186
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,100
<6-11,Penny>我不是那个意思
<6-11,Penny>That's not what I'm saying.

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,550
<6-12,Leonard>你是指让我勇敢反抗
<6-12,Leonard>This is the thing about me standing up to him

188
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,990
<6-12,Leonard>-不要让他操控我的人生吗  -对
<6-12,Leonard>- and not letting him run my life? - Yes.

189
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,990
<6-14,Leonard>我就那意思
<6-14,Leonard>That.

190
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,570
<6-15,Sheldon>好吧  我知道问题在哪儿了
<6-15,Sheldon>Okay. I think we've found the problem here.

191
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,550
<6-15,Sheldon>问题根本不在餐桌
<6-15,Sheldon>It's not the table at all.

192
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,710
<6-16,Penny>-而是在你  -我吗
<6-16,Penny>- It's you. - Me?

193
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,520
<6-17,Leonard>平时他老怪我  这次你就牺牲下吧
<6-17,Leonard>Well, it's always me-- take one for the team.

194
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,260
<6-18,Sheldon>我花了多年时间把这块烂泥
<6-18,Sheldon>I have spent years turning this lump of clay

195
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,580
<6-18,Sheldon>按照我的意愿打造成我能接受的室友
<6-18,Sheldon>into an acceptable conduit for my will,

196
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,040
<6-18,Sheldon>然后你出现  用你新奇的想法
<6-18,Sheldon>and then you came along and reshaped him,

197
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,250
<6-18,Sheldon>和华丽丽的生殖器改造了他
<6-18,Sheldon>with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.

198
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,880
<6-19,Penny>你就让他这么跟我说话吗
<6-19,Penny>Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?

199
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,650
<6-20,Leonard>"华丽丽"这个词听上去像是夸你啊
<6-20,Leonard>"Fancy" sounds like a compliment.

200
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,790
<6-21,Penny>好吧  我没有要试着改变莱纳德
<6-21,Penny>Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard.

201
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,370
<6-21,Penny>只是恋爱中的人都会这样
<6-21,Penny>That's just what happens in relationships.

202
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,390
<6-21,Penny>瞧瞧你被艾米改变了多少
<6-21,Penny>Look how much Amy's changed you.

203
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,390
<6-22,Sheldon>-才没有呢  -拜托
<6-22,Sheldon>- That's not true. - Oh, please.

204
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,200
<6-23,Penny>我刚认识你时  你根本无法
<6-23,Penny>When I first met you, you were incapable

205
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,690
<6-23,Penny>跟任何人产生身体接触
<6-23,Penny>of touching another human being.

206
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,380
<6-23,Penny>现在你会跟人拉手  你会跟人约会
<6-23,Penny>Now you're holding hands, you're going on dates,

207
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,690
<6-23,Penny>你甚至在火车上跟她接吻
<6-23,Penny>you even made out with her on a train.

208
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,200
<6-24,Sheldon>她居然告诉你了
<6-24,Sheldon>She told you?!

209
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,140
<6-25,Penny>她当然告诉我了  这是这辈子
<6-25,Penny>Of course she told me-- it's the most interesting thing

210
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,830
<6-25,Penny>发生在她身上最有趣的事情
<6-25,Penny>that's ever happened to her in her entire life!

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,660
<6-26,Leonard>你是当事人才没意识到
<6-26,Leonard>You're too close to it,

212
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,010
<6-26,Leonard>但艾米的确对你影响很大
<6-26,Leonard>but Amy has had a huge impact on you.

213
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,400
<6-26,Leonard>你说得对
<6-26,Leonard>You're right.

214
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,830
<6-27,Sheldon>我一直没意识到  我默默让那女人
<6-27,Sheldon>Without realizing it, I've allowed that woman

215
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,960
<6-27,Sheldon>改变了我的个性
<6-27,Sheldon>to alter my personality.

216
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,770
<6-28,Leonard>谢尔顿  你没有个性
<6-28,Leonard>Mm, Sheldon, you didn't have a personality;

217
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,390
<6-28,Leonard>你只是有几个爱看的节目而已
<6-28,Leonard>you just had some shows you liked.

218
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,630
<6-28,Leonard>不
<6-28,Leonard>No.

219
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,450
<6-29,Sheldon>不  我是改变了
<6-29,Sheldon>No, I've changed.

220
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,920
<6-29,Sheldon>就像一只被放进一锅水的青蛙
<6-29,Sheldon>Like the frog who's put in a pot of water

221
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,210
<6-29,Sheldon>水是被慢慢加热的
<6-29,Sheldon>that's heated so gradually

222
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,560
<6-29,Sheldon>所以青蛙根本意识不到自己会被煮死
<6-29,Sheldon>he doesn't realize he's boiling to death.

223
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,910
<6-30,Penny>或者你是一只被公主吻了的青蛙
<6-30,Penny>Or you're the frog who's been kissed by a princess

224
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,320
<6-30,Penny>最终会变成王子
<6-30,Penny>and turned into a prince.

225
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,800
<6-31,Leonard>又或者你是一只惹人烦的高个青蛙
<6-31,Leonard>Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.

226
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,900
<6-32,Sheldon>失陪一下
<6-32,Sheldon>Excuse me.

227
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,910
<6-32,Sheldon>我要去跟我女朋友分手
<6-32,Sheldon>I have to break up with my girlfriend.

228
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,340
<6-33,Penny>-谢尔顿  等等  -不
<6-33,Penny>- Oh, Sheldon, wait. - No.

229
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,610
<6-34,Sheldon>是你们让我看清了真相
<6-34,Sheldon>You've opened my eyes to the truth.

230
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,910
<6-34,Sheldon>艾米把我变成了一个感情更丰富
<6-34,Sheldon>Amy has made me a more affectionate,

231
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,310
<6-34,Sheldon>思想更开明的人
<6-34,Sheldon>open-minded person.

232
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,650
<6-34,Sheldon>改变到此结束
<6-34,Sheldon>And that stops now.

233
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,840
<6-35,Leonard>-我们应该打给她  -是啊
<6-35,Leonard>- Well, we should call her. - Yeah, mm-hmm.

234
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,870
<6-36,Penny>艾米  我是佩妮
<6-36,Penny>Amy, it's Penny. Hey.

235
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,270
<6-36,Penny>先给你提个醒
<6-36,Penny>Just a little heads-up.

236
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,960
<6-36,Penny>莱纳德买了一张餐桌
<6-36,Penny>Leonard bought a dining room table.

237
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,510
<6-36,Penny>是的  谢尔顿要跟你分手
<6-36,Penny>Yeah. Sheldon's breaking up with you.

238
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,790
<7-1,Sheldon>艾米  艾米
<7-1,Sheldon>Amy? Amy?

239
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,060
<7-1,Sheldon>艾米
<7-1,Sheldon>Amy?

240
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,140
<7-1,Sheldon>我就直截了当地说吧
<7-1,Sheldon>I'll get right to the point.

241
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,770
<7-1,Sheldon>我觉得我们应该结束这段感情  所以
<7-1,Sheldon>I think we need to end this relationship-- so...

242
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,260
<7-1,Sheldon>麻烦你用手在这上面签名  对了
<7-1,Sheldon>just sign this with your finger, and, uh,

243
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,530
<7-1,Sheldon>眼泪不要掉到我的iPad上
<7-1,Sheldon>please don't cry on my iPad--

244
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,800
<7-2,Amy>我的机子没保修服务
<7-2,Amy>I didn't get AppleCare.

245
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,950
<7-2,Amy>我不意外你会想结束我们这段感情
<7-2,Amy>I'm not surprised you want to end the relationship.

246
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,950
<7-2,Amy>让我意外的是  你居然没买保修
<7-2,Amy>I'm a little surprised you didn't get AppleCare.

247
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,410
<7-2,Amy>总之好好享受你的人生  我要在哪里签名
<7-2,Amy>Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?

248
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,230
<7-3,Sheldon>最下面  不得不说
<7-3,Sheldon>At the bottom. I must say,

249
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,900
<7-3,Sheldon>你没有对此大哭大闹  我感到很欣慰
<7-3,Sheldon>I'm relieved you're not making more of a scene out of this.

250
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,600
<7-4,Amy>我已经看开了
<7-4,Amy>Oh, I've already moved on.

251
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,810
<7-4,Amy>再说了  这次分手又不是我的错
<7-4,Amy>Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.

252
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,730
<7-5,Sheldon>-是吗  -当然
<7-5,Sheldon>- Wh... It doesn't? - Of course not.

253
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,970
<7-6,Amy>这只是莱纳德故意挑拨我们感情
<7-6,Amy>This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off

254
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,150
<7-6,Amy>想把焦点从那张让人讨厌的餐桌转移走
<7-6,Amy>that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship.

255
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,300
<7-6,Amy>他总是这样把你玩弄于股掌之中
<7-6,Amy>He's manipulating you like he always does.

256
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,270
<7-7,Sheldon>慢着慢着  先别签
<7-7,Sheldon>Wait-wait, now, hang on.

257
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,210
<7-7,Sheldon>你觉得他在操控我思想吗
<7-7,Sheldon>You think he manipulates me?

258
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,950
<7-8,Amy>向来如此
<7-8,Amy>All the time.

259
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,230
<7-8,Amy>他肯定知道
<7-8,Amy>And he knew that,

260
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,570
<7-8,Amy>我作为你的女朋友  我不会袖手旁观
<7-8,Amy>as your girlfriend, I wasn't gonna stand by

261
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,980
<7-8,Amy>让他把那张桌子搬进你的公寓
<7-8,Amy>and let him bring a table into your apartment.

262
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,700
<7-8,Amy>一张破餐桌  有没有搞错啊
<7-8,Amy>I mean, a table? Come on!

263
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,120
<7-9,Sheldon>那餐桌难看死了
<7-9,Sheldon>It is hideous.

264
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,510
<7-10,Amy>谢天谢地  我不用看见它
<7-10,Amy>Well, thankfully, I won't have to see it,

265
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,800
<7-10,Amy>因为我再也不是你的女朋友了
<7-10,Amy>'cause I won't be your girlfriend anymore.

266
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,120
<7-10,Amy>艾米·菲拉·福勒
<7-10,Amy>Amy Farrah Fowler.

267
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,450
<7-10,Amy>好的  我愿意填写用户问卷
<7-10,Amy>Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.

268
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,590
<7-10,Amy>慢着
<7-10,Amy>Wait.

269
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,910
<7-11,Sheldon>之前你真的会站在我这边
<7-11,Sheldon>You were really gonna stand by me

270
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,180
<7-11,Sheldon>跟我一起反对那张餐桌进驻吗
<7-11,Sheldon>against the dining room table?

271
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,920
<7-12,Amy>当然啦
<7-12,Amy>Of course I was.

272
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,560
<7-12,Amy>好吧  等等
<7-12,Amy>Yeah, wait.

273
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,430
<7-13,Sheldon>我怎么知道你现在不是在试图摆布我呢
<7-13,Sheldon>How do I know that you're not manipulating me right now?

274
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,010
<7-14,Amy>如果我在摆布你
<7-14,Amy>I think if I were manipulating you,

275
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,640
<7-14,Amy>你这么聪明肯定能看出来
<7-14,Amy>you'd be smart enough to see it.

276
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,180
<7-15,Sheldon>我怎么知道你这么说
<7-15,Sheldon>How do I know you're not saying that

277
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,980
<7-15,Sheldon>不是你摆布我的其中一步
<7-15,Sheldon>as part of the manipulation?

278
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,070
<7-16,Amy>我觉得你这么聪明  也一定能看出来
<7-16,Amy>I think you'd be smart enough to see that, too.

279
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,720
<7-16,Amy>好吧
<7-16,Amy>Okay.

280
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,400
<7-17,Sheldon>抱歉让你难过了  我只是想确认一下
<7-17,Sheldon>I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time-- I just had to be sure.

281
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,300
<8-1,Raj>太空总署让霍华德重返太空
<8-1,Raj>It's pretty exciting that NASA

282
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,200
<8-1,Raj>真是超级让人兴奋呀
<8-1,Raj>wants to send Howard back up.

283
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,490
<8-2,Bermadette>是啊  好兴奋啊
<8-2,Bermadette>Yeah, exciting.

284
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,810
<8-2,Bermadette>-我能问你个问题吗  -当然
<8-2,Bermadette>- Can I ask you something? - Course.

285
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
<8-4,Bernadette>他明明讨厌在太空的整个过程
<8-4,Bernadette>He hated that entire experience.

286
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,140
<8-4,Bernadette>我不支持他重返太空
<8-4,Bernadette>Does it make me an awful wife

287
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,970
<8-4,Bernadette>是不是就成了糟糕的妻子啊
<8-4,Bernadette>if I don't think he should do it again?

288
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,360
<8-5,Raj>完全不会
<8-5,Raj>Not at all.

289
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,390
<8-5,Raj>他只是忘了他在太空的
<8-5,Raj>He's forgotten how miserable he was

290
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,180
<8-5,Raj>整个过程有多悲催
<8-5,Raj>the entire time he was up there.

291
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,200
<8-5,Raj>就像我思念印度的那些时刻
<8-5,Raj>It's like me in those moments when I miss India.

292
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,570
<8-6,Bernadette>-那你会跟他谈吗  -为什么是我
<8-6,Bernadette>- So you'll talk to him? - Why me?

293
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,890
<8-8,Bernadette>我是他妻子  我不想泼他冷水
<8-8,Bernadette>Well, I'm his wife; I don't want to ruin it for him.

294
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,970
<8-9,Raj>我们之间就是这样啊
<8-9,Raj>That's the dynamic--

295
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,050
<8-9,Raj>我是开心果  你是扫兴鬼
<8-9,Raj>I'm the fun one, you're the buzzkill.

296
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,250
<8-10,Bernadette>我从什么时候起是扫兴鬼了
<8-10,Bernadette>Since when am I the buzzkill?

297
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,910
<8-11,Raj>你觉得这个酷吗
<8-11,Raj>Do you think this is cool?

298
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,160
<8-12,Bernadette>不  我觉得这个很傻
<8-12,Bernadette>No, I think it's stupid.

299
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,200
<8-14,Bernadette>你说得对  这个太酷了
<8-14,Bernadette>You're right, it's great.

300
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,310
<9-1,Sheldon>你们好啊
<9-1,Sheldon>Hello.

301
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,480
<9-2,Leonard>你们没有分手啊
<9-2,Leonard>You guys didn't break up.

302
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,550
<9-3,Sheldon>没有  抱歉让你失望了
<9-3,Sheldon>No. Sorry to disappoint you,

303
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,960
<9-3,Sheldon>但艾米指出来
<9-3,Sheldon>but Amy pointed out that

304
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,020
<9-3,Sheldon>你只是想操控我
<9-3,Sheldon>you were only trying to manipulate me.

305
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,440
<9-4,Amy>这一点是你自己想明白的
<9-4,Amy>Which you also figured out by yourself.

306
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,100
<9-5,Sheldon>这一点是我自己想明白的
<9-5,Sheldon>Which I also figured out by myself.

307
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,670
<9-6,Penny>我很开心你们依然在一起
<9-6,Penny>Well, I'm glad you're still together.

308
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,110
<9-7,Sheldon>好啦  你别再试图
<9-7,Sheldon>Yeah, okay, you can stop trying

309
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,860
<9-7,Sheldon>把矛盾点扯到我们的感情上
<9-7,Sheldon>to make this about our relationship.

310
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,890
<9-8,Amy>我们感情情比金坚
<9-8,Amy>Which is stronger than ever.

311
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,140
<9-8,Amy>我们感情情比金坚
<9-8,Amy>Which is stronger than ever.

312
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,240
<9-9,Sheldon>这次都怪你  试图改变我的生活环境
<9-9,Sheldon>This is about you trying to change my environment,

313
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,150
<9-9,Sheldon>而本来的环境就很完美
<9-9,Sheldon>which was perfect the way it was.

314
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,100
<9-10,Howard>但这个完美也是通过改变而来的
<9-10,Howard>But it got the way it was through change.

315
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,960
<9-10,Howard>这个你喜欢的专座
<9-10,Howard>The-the spot that you love to sit in,

316
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,620
<9-10,Howard>你不让别人坐的专座
<9-10,Howard>that no one else can sit in,

317
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,270
<9-10,Howard>之所以存在的唯一原因是
<9-10,Howard>only exists because--

318
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,470
<9-10,Howard>我不顾你的反对买了这个沙发
<9-10,Howard>despite your objections-- I bought this couch.

319
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,100
<9-10,Howard>所以得谢谢我
<9-10,Howard>Me.

320
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,610
<9-10,Howard>所以请你解释下  为什么那个改变不好
<9-10,Howard>So explain why that change was bad

321
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,630
<9-10,Howard>而这个改变是好的
<9-10,Howard>and this change was good.

322
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,400
<9-12,Amy>你不必向他解释你的想法
<9-12,Amy>You don't need to explain yourself to him.

323
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,050
<9-13,Sheldon>我不必向你解释我的想法
<9-13,Sheldon>I don't need to explain myself to you!

324
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,130
<9-14,Amy>你已经受够了他的废话  准备和我同居
<9-14,Amy>You're sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.

325
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,710
<9-15,Sheldon>破餐桌爱留就留  我们不差那点空间
<9-15,Sheldon>Keep the table! We don't use that space!

326
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,560
<9-16,Amy>娘的  我太得意忘形了
<9-16,Amy>Damn it, I got cocky.

327
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,710
<10-1,Howard>妮妮  我回来了  大家好
<10-1,Howard>Hey, Bernie. I'm home... Hello.

328
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,900
<10-2,Bernadette>你好  亲爱的
<10-2,Bernadette>Hi, honey.

329
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,680
<10-3,Howard>出什么事了
<10-3,Howard>What's going on?

330
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,000
<10-4,Bernadette>或许你该先坐下
<10-4,Bernadette>Maybe you should have a seat.

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,960
<10-5,Howard>好吧
<10-5,Howard>Um... okay.

332
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,820
<10-5,Howard>我知道我妈没过世  否则就有气球装饰了
<10-5,Howard>I know my mom's not dead; there'd be balloons.

333
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,410
<10-6,Raj>首先
<10-6,Raj>First off,

334
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,490
<10-6,Raj>你要知道我们都爱你珍惜你
<10-6,Raj>know that we all love you and cherish you.

335
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,770
<10-7,Mike Rostenkowski>-我算不上...  -老爸
<10-7,Mike Rostenkowski>- Well, I wouldn't... - Daddy.

336
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,970
<10-9,Mike R>你很棒
<10-9,Mike R>You're great.

337
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,260
<10-10,Mike Massimino (on skype)>-我能说几句吗  -当然
<10-10,Mike Massimino (on skype)>- Can I say something? - Oh, of course.

338
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,950
<10-12,Mike M>你好  果麦圈客
<10-12,Mike M>Hey, Fruit Loops.

339
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,450
<10-13,Howard>马西米诺  你怎么也在
<10-13,Howard>Massimino? Why are you here?

340
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,700
<10-14,Mike M>我听说你在考虑
<10-14,Mike M>Well, I heard you were thinking about

341
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,990
<10-14,Mike M>重返太空站的事
<10-14,Mike M>going back up to the space station,

342
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,920
<10-14,Mike M>作为和你在上面共事过的战友...
<10-14,Mike M>and as someone who's been there with you...

343
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,730
<10-14,Mike M>你知道宇航员必须具备"正确的质素"吧
<10-14,Mike M>well, you know how astronauts need to have the "right stuff"?

344
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,090
<10-15,Howard>当然知道
<10-15,Howard>Sure.

345
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,390
<10-16,Mike M>你所具备的质素都是错的
<10-16,Mike M>The stuff you have is wrong.

346
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,070
<10-17,Howard>你觉得我在上面的工作并不优秀吗
<10-17,Howard>You don't think I did a good job up there?

347
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,650
<10-18,Mike M>你做得还行
<10-18,Mike M>You did a fine job.

348
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,180
<10-18,Mike M>只是  整个过程你一直怕得半死  悲惨不堪
<10-18,Mike M>It's just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.

349
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,330
<10-19,Bernadette>我想大家想说的是
<10-19,Bernadette>I think what we're all trying to say is,

350
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,610
<10-19,Bernadette>你似乎不记得
<10-19,Bernadette>you don't seem to be remembering

351
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,970
<10-19,Bernadette>这段太空之旅带给了你多大的创伤
<10-19,Bernadette>how traumatic the experience was for you.

352
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,230
<10-20,Raj>好比说女人经常会忘记分娩的痛苦
<10-20,Raj>L-Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.

353
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,050
<10-21,Mike R>好比女人  这比喻不错
<10-21,Mike R>Like a woman. Great analogy.

354
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,350
<10-22,Howard>好吧  也许我当时是有些害怕
<10-22,Howard>Fine, maybe I was a little scared.

355
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,310
<10-23,Mike M>你尿在了宇航服里
<10-23,Mike M>You peed in your space suit.

356
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,790
<10-24,Howard>本来就是该尿在里面啊
<10-24,Howard>You're supposed to do that.

357
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,130
<10-25,Mike M>不是在试穿的时候
<10-25,Mike M>Not during the fitting.

358
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,480
<10-26,Mike R>孩子  需要我提醒你上次你升空前
<10-26,Mike R>Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do

359
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,150
<10-26,Mike R>你求我做什么吗
<10-26,Mike R>before you went up last time?

360
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,050
<10-27,Howard>慢着  我那只是开玩笑
<10-27,Howard>Hang on. That was just me joking around.

361
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,220
<10-28,Mike R>你要我冲你的脚开枪
<10-28,Mike R>You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.

362
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,340
<10-29,Howard>这怎么可能不是玩笑啦
<10-29,Howard>Come on, how is that not a joke?

363
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,280
<10-29,Howard>"你得帮我脱身  冲我的脚开枪"
<10-29,Howard>"You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot."

364
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,850
<10-30,Bernadette>别忘了其他宇航员欺负你的事
<10-30,Bernadette>Don't forget all the other astronauts picking on you.

365
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,610
<10-31,Raj>还有你在失重环境下吐了
<10-31,Raj>And how you threw up in zero gravity,

366
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,900
<10-31,Raj>呕吐物又飘回到你嘴里
<10-31,Raj>and it floated back in your mouth.

367
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,770
<10-31,Raj>然后你又吐了
<10-31,Raj>And you threw up again.

368
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,170
<10-31,Raj>这过程周而复始
<10-31,Raj>And so on and so on.

369
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,810
<10-32,Mike M>那蛮搞笑的
<10-32,Mike M>That was funny.

370
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,480
<10-33,Howard>我在上面的表现是比不上约翰·格伦[著名宇航员]
<10-33,Howard>Okay, so I wasn't exactly John Glenn up there,

371
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,530
<10-33,Howard>但我改变了  我现在不同了
<10-33,Howard>but I've changed; I'm a different man now.

372
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,270
<10-33,Howard>你们觉得我不能胜任
<10-33,Howard>Yeah, and I'm a little insulted

373
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,550
<10-33,Howard>让我有种被羞辱的感觉
<10-33,Howard>that you guys don't think I can handle it.

374
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,580
<10-34,Mike M>你知道你还得再次通过生存训练吧
<10-34,Mike M>You know you're gonna have to go through survival training again.

375
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,530
<10-35,Howard>是吗
<10-35,Howard>Really?

376
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,000
<11-1,Howard>你得帮我脱身
<11-1,Howard>You've got to get me out of this!

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,460
<11-2,Doctor>你想要我怎么做  你太健康了
<11-2,Doctor>What do you want me to do? You're perfectly healthy.

378
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,390
<11-3,Howard>再量下我的血压
<11-3,Howard>Check my blood pressure again!

379
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,810
<11-3,Howard>我可以让血压升高  稍等
<11-3,Howard>I can get it higher; just give me a second.

380
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,890
<11-5,Howard>-喂  -妈  你好吗
<11-5,Howard>- Hello? - Hi, Ma. How are you?

381
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,240
<11-6,Mrs Wolowitz>老娘还没死呢
<11-6,Mrs Wolowitz>How I am is not dead!

382
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,520
<11-6,Mrs Wolowitz>但你不会知道
<11-6,Mrs Wolowitz>But you wouldn't know that,

383
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,300
<11-6,Mrs Wolowitz>因为你根本不爱我  电话都懒得打
<11-6,Mrs Wolowitz>because you don't love me enough to pick up the phone!

384
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,500
<11-8,Mrs Wolowitz>你得知道  我有可能在浴缸滑倒摔死
<11-8,Mrs Wolowitz>For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned!

385
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,040
<11-7,Howard>快量快量
<11-7,Howard>Go, go, go!

386
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,370
<11-8,Mrs Wolowitz>你艾达阿姨就是这么死的
<11-8,Mrs Wolowitz>That's what happened to your Aunt Ida!

387
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,120
<12-1,Raj>霍华德  真遗憾你的血压这么高
<12-1,Raj>Howard, I'm so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.

388
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,630
<12-2,Howard>我也是  医生倒是愿意
<12-2,Howard>Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing

389
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,430
<12-2,Howard>为我捏造健康报告  但是
<12-2,Howard>to fudge the results, but...

390
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,070
<12-2,Howard>那太他娘不诚实了
<12-2,Howard>it just seemed so darned dishonest.

391
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,820
<12-3,Leonard>但离任务开始不是至少还有一年吗
<12-3,Leonard>But the mission wouldn't be for at least a year.

392
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,430
<12-3,Leonard>你的血压不是还有足够时间恢复到...
<12-3,Leonard>Isn't that enough time to get your blood pressure under...

393
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,660
<12-4,Howard>我知道我血压太高  别再提这事了
<12-4,Howard>Look, my blood pressure's too high, okay? Drop it.

394
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,820
<12-5,Penny>我姨妈改变了饮食习惯
<12-5,Penny>You know, my aunt changed her diet,

395
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,700
<12-5,Penny>-几个月后  她...  -上了太空吗
<12-5,Penny>- and in a few months, she... - Went to space?

396
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,790
<12-6,Howard>我想不可能吧  把酱油递给我
<12-6,Howard>I don't think so. Now, pass the soy sauce.

397
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,750
<12-6,Howard>不要绿色那瓶  要红色的
<12-6,Howard>Hey, not the green one; the red one.

398
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,630
<12-7,Penny>谢尔顿  艾米  过来和我们一起吃好吗
<12-7,Penny>Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?

399
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,020
<12-8,Bernadette>是啊  这里很欢乐
<12-8,Bernadette>Yeah, it's fun up here.

400
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,360
<12-9,Leonard>那你为什么要毁了欢乐时光呢
<12-9,Leonard>So why are you trying to ruin it?

401
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,680
<12-9,Leonard>好意心领了  我们很好
<12-9,Leonard>No, thanks. We're fine.

402
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,050
<12-10,Sheldon>如果你们想在餐桌上吃饭
<12-10,Sheldon>I mean, if you people want to eat at the table,

403
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,050
<12-10,Sheldon>你们就在那里吃吧
<12-10,Sheldon>then that's what you should do.

404
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,530
<12-10,Sheldon>我喜欢在这里吃饭
<12-10,Sheldon>I like eating down here

405
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,470
<12-10,Sheldon>因为我们以前一直是这样
<12-10,Sheldon>because this is how we've always done things.

406
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,870
<12-10,Sheldon>如果过去的岁月逝去了  那就随风去吧
<12-10,Sheldon>But if those days are gone, they're gone.

407
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,820
<12-10,Sheldon>只是  让我很伤心
<12-10,Sheldon>It just... makes me sad.

408
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,260
<12-11,Bernadette>现在我也伤心了
<12-11,Bernadette>Now I feel bad.

409
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,040
<12-12,Leonard>别把他当人看  他有双无辜大眼
<12-12,Leonard>Oh, don't anthropomorphize him; he's got big eyes,

410
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,070
<12-12,Leonard>但他的情感和我们人类不同
<12-12,Leonard>but his feelings are not like ours.

411
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,750
<12-13,Bernadette>不  我们分成两组坐看起来好傻
<12-13,Bernadette>No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.

412
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,460
<12-14,Leonard>如果你把那组的领导人
<12-14,Leonard>Well, it's not silly if you think of that group

413
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,250
<12-14,Leonard>想成是巨型魔婴  就不会觉得傻了
<12-14,Leonard>as being led by a big, evil baby.

414
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,790
<12-15,Bernadette>看艾米坐在那里的样子
<12-15,Bernadette>Look at Amy down there.

415
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,690
<12-15,Bernadette>我们应该过去吗
<12-15,Bernadette>Should we go?

416
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,980
<12-16,Penny>好吧  我们过去
<12-16,Penny>Yeah, let's go.

417
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,050
<12-17,Leonard>但是  佩妮  这原本是你的主意
<12-17,Leonard>But... Penny, this was your idea.

418
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,950
<12-17,Leonard>你说我应该奋起和他抗争
<12-17,Leonard>You said that I should stand up to him.

419
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,040
<12-18,Penny>算了吧  莱纳德
<12-18,Penny>Forget it, Leonard.

420
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,010
<12-18,Penny>抗战结束
<12-18,Penny>It's over.

421
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,660
<12-19,Leonard>好吧
<12-19,Leonard>Fine.

422
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,100
<12-20,Amy>拉杰什
<12-20,Amy>Rajesh?

423
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,140
<12-21,Raj>去死吧  我在地板上坐了七年
<12-21,Raj>Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years.

424
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,540
<12-21,Raj>人家要坐在这里
<12-21,Raj>I'm staying right here!

425
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,210
<12-22,Bernadette>来吧  拉杰  有你感觉才完整
<12-22,Bernadette>Come on, Raj, it's not the same without you.

426
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,340
<12-22,Bernadette>好吧
<12-22,Bernadette>Fine.

427
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,460
<12-23,Raj>但不许再嘲笑我说的"花"[话]
<12-23,Raj>But no more making fun of how I say tings.

428
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,470
<12-24,Howard>你说的"花"是指"笑虎子"吗
<12-24,Howard>You mean "tings" like "moo-stache"?

429
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,790
<12-25,Sheldon>大家齐聚一堂感觉真好
<12-25,Sheldon>Well, isn't this nice.

430
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,500
<12-25,Sheldon>偶尔魔婴也有赢的时候嘛
<12-25,Sheldon>Sometimes the baby wins.
