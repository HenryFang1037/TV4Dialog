1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,470
<1-1,Sheldon>你干嘛呢
<1-1,Sheldon>What are you doing?

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,000
<1-2,Leonard>普丽娅一会要跟我用Skype视频
<1-2,Leonard>Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,170
<1-2,Leonard>我们准备共进晚餐
<1-2,Leonard>and we are gonna have a dinner date.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,470
<1-3,Sheldon>现在是孟买时间早上八点
<1-3,Sheldon>It's 8 o'clock in the morning in Mumbai.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,620
<1-3,Sheldon>她怎么就吃起晚饭来了
<1-3,Sheldon>How can she have dinner?

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,680
<1-4,Leonard>好吧  随你怎么说
<1-4,Leonard>Fine, whatever.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,060
<1-4,Leonard>那普丽娅就吃早餐好了
<1-4,Leonard>Priya will be having breakfast.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,300
<1-5,Sheldon>好吧  所以严格来讲你们俩不是共进晚餐
<1-5,Sheldon>All right, so technically it's not a dinner date.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,820
<1-5,Sheldon>也许你勉强可以把这称为共进早晚餐
<1-5,Sheldon>I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,900
<1-5,Sheldon>不过你要是真这么叫的话
<1-5,Sheldon>But if you did, you'd open yourself

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,640
<1-5,Sheldon>你肯定会被别人笑死  人家肯定会说
<1-5,Sheldon>to peer-based mocking, such as,

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,190
<1-5,Sheldon>莱纳德  你昨晚跟普丽娅的早晚餐吃的好吗
<1-5,Sheldon>"Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,560
<1-6,Leonard>听起来不像是在笑话我呀
<1-6,Leonard>That doesn't sound like mocking.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,030
<1-7,Sheldon>我还没说完呢
<1-7,Sheldon>You didn't let me finish.

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,080
<1-7,Sheldon>早晚餐
<1-7,Sheldon>Dinfast.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,150
<1-7,Sheldon>那是大豆蜡的蜡烛吗
<1-7,Sheldon>Are those soy-based candles?

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,700
<1-8,Leonard>不知道  怎么了
<1-8,Leonard>I don't know. Why?

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,620
<1-9,Sheldon>石蜡蜡烛可能含有致癌物
<1-9,Sheldon>Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,290
<1-9,Sheldon>当然啦  你要是想吃顿早晚餐
<1-9,Sheldon>Unless lung cancer is the ambiance

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,460
<1-9,Sheldon>还搭上肺癌的话  我也不拦你
<1-9,Sheldon>you were going for at your dinfast.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,790
<1-9,Sheldon>早晚餐
<1-9,Sheldon>Dinfast.

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,380
<1-10,Leonard>我不想无礼
<1-10,Leonard>Listen, I don't want to be rude,

23
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,270
<1-10,Leonard>可是普丽娅随时都会打来
<1-10,Leonard>but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so...

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,860
<1-11,Sheldon>对哦  普丽娅
<1-11,Sheldon>Oh, yes, Priya.

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,860
<1-11,Sheldon>莱纳德  你知道我从来
<1-11,Sheldon>Leonard, you know I make a point of

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,740
<1-11,Sheldon>都不干涉你的私事
<1-11,Sheldon>never interfering in your personal affairs.

27
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,820
<1-12,Leonard>没错  我也一直很欣赏你这点
<1-12,Leonard>Yes, I've always admired that about you.

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,250
<1-13,Sheldon>那是当然
<1-13,Sheldon>As well you should.

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,540
<1-13,Sheldon>但是我这次要破例了
<1-13,Sheldon>But I'm going to make an exception here.

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,210
<1-14,Leonard>又来了
<1-14,Leonard>Oh, good.

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,530
<1-15,Sheldon>普丽娅回印度去发展自己的法律事业
<1-15,Sheldon>Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career.

32
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,000
<1-15,Sheldon>你与其花这些时间绝望地挣扎
<1-15,Sheldon>Instead of desperately trying

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,370
<1-15,Sheldon>费劲心思地保持这段跨洲恋情
<1-15,Sheldon>to keep this intercontinental relationship alive,

34
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,420
<1-15,Sheldon>你还不如找点别的兴趣爱好呢
<1-15,Sheldon>you could use that time to take up a hobby.

35
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,770
<1-16,Leonard>兴趣爱好
<1-16,Leonard>A hobby?

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,110
<1-16,Leonard>没错
<1-16,Leonard>Yes.

37
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,360
<1-17,Sheldon>我最近得知堪萨斯州一个家伙
<1-17,Sheldon>I read recently about a fellow in Kansas

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,950
<1-17,Sheldon>拿麻绳团了一个巨大的球
<1-17,Sheldon>with an enormous ball of twine.

39
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,830
<1-17,Sheldon>我认为你可以跟他一比高下
<1-17,Sheldon>I bet you could give him a run for his money.

40
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,040
<1-18,Leonard>你知道吗  有些人可能会说
<1-18,Leonard>You know, some people might say that it's great

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,270
<1-18,Leonard>我们俩保持这种异地恋是精神可嘉的事
<1-18,Leonard>that we're trying to make things work long distance.

42
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,570
<1-18,Leonard>他们会说
<1-18,Leonard>They'd say things like,

43
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,580
<1-18,Leonard>爱情不会被你们俩之间的距离所打败
<1-18,Leonard>"Love is stronger than the miles between you".

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,330
<1-19,Sheldon>等有一天我掌权了  我肯定会灭掉这帮人
<1-19,Sheldon>When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,450
<1-20,Leonard>你也整天跟艾米视频呀
<1-20,Leonard>You video-chat with Amy all the time.

46
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,840
<1-20,Leonard>咱俩干的事有什么不同
<1-20,Leonard>How is this different?

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,340
<1-21,Sheldon>你不喜欢艾米吗
<1-21,Sheldon>Don't you like Amy?

48
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,120
<1-22,Leonard>我当然喜欢艾米啦
<1-22,Leonard>Of course I like Amy.

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,420
<1-23,Sheldon>可我不喜欢普丽娅呀
<1-23,Sheldon>Well, there's the difference.

50
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,960
<1-24,Leonard>不好意思  普丽娅打来了
<1-24,Leonard>Excuse me, that's Priya.

51
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,150
<1-25,Priya (on screen)>莱纳德
<1-25,Priya (on screen)>Hi, Leonard.

52
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,150
<1-26,Leonard>亲爱的
<1-26,Leonard>Hey, honey.

53
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,350
<1-27,Priya>我好想你
<1-27,Priya>I miss you.

54
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,550
<1-28,Leonard>我也好想你
<1-28,Leonard>Oh, I miss you, too.

55
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,890
<1-29,Sheldon>我怀念以前爱情伴侣们
<1-29,Sheldon>I miss the old days when your romantic partners

56
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,340
<1-29,Sheldon>能退回录像店的日子
<1-29,Sheldon>could be returned to the video store.

57
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,450
<2-1,Sheldon>谢谢你让我待在这
<2-1,Sheldon>Thanks for letting me stay here

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,490
<2-1,Sheldon>这样我就不用看着莱纳德跟他女朋友视频了
<2-1,Sheldon>while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.

59
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,120
<2-2,Penny>小意思
<2-2,Penny>Oh, it's no problem.

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,840
<2-2,Penny>这种感觉还挺不错的呢
<2-2,Penny>It's actually kind of nice.

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,490
<2-2,Penny>你在看书  我也在看书
<2-2,Penny>You reading, me reading.

62
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,160
<2-2,Penny>咱俩就像一对老夫老妻似的
<2-2,Penny>We're like an old married couple.

63
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,460
<2-3,Sheldon>咱俩要真是老夫老妻的话
<2-3,Sheldon>If we were an old married couple,

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,120
<2-3,Sheldon>妻子这个时候就会端上冻柠茶和曲奇饼了
<2-3,Sheldon>the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,050
<2-4,Penny>我家没有冻柠茶和曲奇饼
<2-4,Penny>I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles.

66
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,310
<2-5,Sheldon>尽职的妻子就会去商店买
<2-5,Sheldon>A good wife would go to the store.

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,690
<2-6,Penny>我要离婚
<2-6,Penny>I want a divorce.

68
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,700
<2-7,Sheldon>很好  你去找律师的路上
<2-7,Sheldon>Good. On the way to see the lawyer,

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,190
<2-7,Sheldon>别忘了买点冻柠茶和曲奇饼
<2-7,Sheldon>pick up some tea and cookies.

70
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,270
<2-7,Sheldon>我还真得说  我挺喜欢你这张新椅子的
<2-7,Sheldon>I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.

71
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,630
<2-8,Penny>舒服吧
<2-8,Penny>It's great, isn't it?

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
<2-8,Penny>没错
<2-8,Penny>It is.

73
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,940
<2-9,Sheldon>符合腰椎曲线
<2-9,Sheldon>Aligns the lumbar,

74
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,360
<2-9,Sheldon>支撑住了尾骨  还平衡了臀部
<2-9,Sheldon>cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks.

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,780
<2-9,Sheldon>这椅子还真对得起它的名字
<2-9,Sheldon>This is a chair worthy of the name.

76
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,860
<2-10,Penny>什么名字
<2-10,Penny>What name?

77
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,180
<2-11,Sheldon>椅子呀
<2-11,Sheldon>Chair.

78
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,990
<2-12,Penny>好吧  你喜欢就好
<2-12,Penny>Oh, all right, well, I'm glad you like it.

79
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,900
<2-12,Penny>我还是想不通
<2-12,Penny>I mean, I still can't get over the fact

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,870
<2-12,Penny>怎么有人就忍心把它给扔了呢
<2-12,Penny>someone just threw it away.

81
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,330
<2-13,Sheldon>你说什么
<2-13,Sheldon>What?

82
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,780
<2-14,Penny>就是说呀  这椅子就被丢在路上
<2-14,Penny>Yeah, it was just sitting on the street.

83
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,290
<2-14,Penny>我给了个流浪汉十块钱  让他帮我把这张椅子搬上来的
<2-14,Penny>I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.

84
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,640
<2-15,Sheldon (jumps up)>哦天呐  哦天呐
<2-15,Sheldon (jumps up)>Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,630
<2-16,Penny>你怎么啦
<2-16,Penny>What is wrong?

86
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,120
<2-17,Sheldon>我刚坐在垃圾上了
<2-17,Sheldon>I've been sitting in garbage!

87
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,650
<2-18,Penny>谢尔顿  淡定嘛
<2-18,Penny>Sheldon, take it easy.

88
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,470
<2-19,Sheldon>你去淡定吧  我得去趟浴室
<2-19,Sheldon>You take it easy! I need to use your shower.

89
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,560
<2-20,Penny>我当年结婚的时候还是太过乐观了
<2-20,Penny>I went into this marriage with so much hope.

90
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,620
<2-21,Sheldon>浴室地板上有张湿创口贴
<2-21,Sheldon>There's a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor!

100
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,560
<3-1,Raj>真有意思
<3-1,Raj>This is fun.

101
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,760
<3-1,Raj>我还从来没用过热成型液压机呢
<3-1,Raj>I've never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.

102
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,090
<3-2,Howard>很赞吧
<3-2,Howard>Pretty sweet, huh?

103
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,230
<3-2,Howard>这个小玩意儿花了学校十七万五千刀
<3-2,Howard>This little baby set the university back 175 grand.

104
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,280
<3-3,Leonard>三分钟到了

<3-5,Raj>这真是个有型的三明治
<3-5,Raj>This is one good-looking panini.

108

<3-8,Howard>你那跨国异地恋怎么样啦
<3-8,Howard>How's it going with the long-distance love affair?

111
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,760
<3-9,Leonard>不容易啊  但我俩正在努力
<3-9,Leonard>Not easy, but we're making it work.

112
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,600
<3-10,Howard>你这句"正在努力"包不包括玩些线上耍流氓啊
<3-10,Howard>When you say "Making it work," does that include doing the cyber nasty?

113
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
<3-11,Leonard>什么
<3-11,Leonard>What?

114
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,300
<3-12,Howard>你懂的  就是虚拟的很黄很暴力的那种啊
<3-12,Howard>You know, the virtual pickle tickle.

115
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,570
<3-12,Howard>数字化的嘿嘿咻咻
<3-12,Howard>The digital... bow-chicka-bow-bow.

116
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,320
<3-13,Raj>拜托  伙计  你在说我妹啊
<3-13,Raj>Come on, dude. This is my sister you're talking about.

117
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,620
<3-14,Howard>喂  对你来说
<3-14,Howard>Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her

118
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,940
<3-14,Howard>莱纳德在摄像头里对着她抖那货
<3-14,Howard>through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with

119
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,990
<3-14,Howard>总要好过他当着她的面拿那货戳她吧
<3-14,Howard>than him actually touching her with it.

120
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,800
<3-15,Leonard>我没那么猥琐
<3-15,Leonard>There's no junk jiggling.

121
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,110
<3-15,Leonard>我们就是聊天而已
<3-15,Leonard>We just talk.

122
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,970
<3-15,Leonard>你疯了吧
<3-15,Leonard>Are you sane?

123
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,250
<3-16,Howard>有了高速互联网  你的指尖下
<3-16,Howard>With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips

125
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,910
<3-16,Howard>就是继小手帕之后性爱领域的
<3-16,Howard>the greatest advancement in the field of sex

126
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,590
<3-16,Howard>最伟大的进步啊
<3-16,Howard>since the invention of the washcloth.

127
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
<3-17,Leonard>我不能那么做
<3-17,Leonard>I can't do that.

128
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,280
<3-18,Howard>好吧  你要是不这么做
<3-18,Howard>Well, if you don't,

129
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,780
<3-18,Howard>你就是把普丽娅拱手让给某个
<3-18,Howard>you're gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban

130
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,700
<3-18,Howard>从小看《印度爱经》插图版长大的头巾男了
<3-18,Howard>who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.

131
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,070
<3-19,Raj>你怎么能这么种族歧视呢
<3-19,Raj>How can you be so racist?

132
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,290
<3-20,Howard>拜托  我哪句说错了
<3-20,Howard>Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.

133
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,290
<3-21,Sheldon (entering)>莱纳德  很好
<3-21,Sheldon (entering)>Oh, Leonard, good.

134
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,430
<3-21,Sheldon (entering)>找到你了
<3-21,Sheldon (entering)>There you are.

135
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,430
<3-21,Sheldon (entering)>我需要你来检查我头上有没有虱子
<3-21,Sheldon (entering)>I need you to check my head for chair lice.

136
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,250
<3-22,Leonard>我昨晚查过了  我不能再犯傻了
<3-22,Leonard>I did it last night, I'm not doing it again.

137
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,970
<3-23,Howard>没检查别的地儿  对吧
<3-23,Howard>Just his head, right?

138
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,440
<3-24,Leonard>我不想聊这事儿
<3-24,Leonard>I don't want to talk about it.

139
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,140
<3-24,Leonard>佩妮椅子上的虫子没跑到你身上
<3-24,Leonard>You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.

140
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,560
<3-24,Leonard>不对  有虫子
<3-24,Leonard>Yes, I did.

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,900
<3-25,Sheldon>现在它们在我的发根毛囊里欢呼雀跃
<3-25,Sheldon>And now they're cavorting at the base of my hair follicles

142
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,430
<3-25,Sheldon>就像在红木国家森林公园里跳舞
<3-25,Sheldon>like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.

143
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,770
<3-26,Leonard>谢尔顿  你老是这样
<3-26,Leonard>Sheldon, you do this all the time.

144
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,910
<3-26,Leonard>你总是纠结于某个傻乎乎的想法
<3-26,Leonard>You fixate on some crazy idea

145
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,710
<3-26,Leonard>然后无限制地放大
<3-26,Leonard>and then blow it way out of proportion.

146
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,910
<3-27,Sheldon>请举一个例子
<3-27,Sheldon>Name one time I've ever done that.

147
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,460
<3-28,Leonard>比如上次你把GPS追踪器放进垃圾桶里
<3-28,Leonard>How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage

148
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,380
<3-28,Leonard>就因为你坚信朝鲜间谍
<3-28,Leonard>because you were convinced North Korean spies

149
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,350
<3-28,Leonard>在偷你的草稿纸
<3-28,Leonard>were stealing your doodles?

150
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,660
<3-28,Leonard>还有你坚信是人肉做的鸡块
<3-28,Leonard>The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets.

151
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,510
<3-28,Leonard>还有那朵奇形怪状的在城里老跟踪你的云
<3-28,Leonard>The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town.

152
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,930
<3-28,Leonard>还有那次你错穿了我的T恤
<3-28,Leonard>The time you put on my shirt by mistake

153
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,730
<3-28,Leonard>还以为自己又开始长个儿了
<3-28,Leonard>and were convinced you'd started growing again.

154
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,730
<3-29,Sheldon>我说的是  "举一个例子"
<3-29,Sheldon>I said, "Name one."

155
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,490
<3-29,Sheldon>你的听力真得练练了
<3-29,Sheldon>You really need to work on your listening skills.

156
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,150
<4-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<4-1,Sheldon>Penny.

157
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,350
<4-1,Sheldon>佩妮  佩妮

158
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,550
<4-2,Penny>乃好[你好]
<4-2,Penny>Yello.

159
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,720
<4-3,Sheldon>你得把那个椅子从楼里搬出去
<4-3,Sheldon>You need to remove that chair from the building.

160
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,580
<4-3,Sheldon>它是个卫生隐患
<4-3,Sheldon>It's a health hazard.

161
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,420
<4-4,Penny>好吧  淡定吧  我把家具套给拆下来
<4-4,Penny>Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers,

162
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,970
<4-4,Penny>送去干洗了  坐垫也熏蒸消毒了
<4-4,Penny>had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.

163
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,270
<4-5,Sheldon>真的吗
<4-5,Sheldon>Really?

164
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,740
<4-6,Penny>必须的  它现在比我的沙发还干净
<4-6,Penny>Yeah. It's cleaner than my couch.

165
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,400
<4-6,Penny>我还在里面找到了半个鸡蛋灌饼呢
<4-6,Penny>Found half a Hot Pocket in there.

166
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,250
<4-7,Sheldon>看起来还不错
<4-7,Sheldon>It certainly looks okay.

167
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,700
<4-7,Sheldon>有一股强烈的有毒化学药剂味
<4-7,Sheldon>Has a strong toxic chemical smell.

168
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,370
<4-7,Sheldon>真让人安心啊
<4-7,Sheldon>That's reassuring.

169
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,290
<4-8,Penny>坐上去试试呗  谢尔顿
<4-8,Penny>Why don't you give it a try, Sheldon?

170
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,120
<4-8,Penny>好吧
<4-8,Penny>All right.

171
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,990
<4-9,Sheldon>这椅子挺舒服
<4-9,Sheldon>It is a comfortable chair.

172
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,150
<4-10,Penny>你为啥不承认你之前反应过激了呢
<4-10,Penny>Why don't you just admit you overreacted?

173
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,060
<4-11,Sheldon>不必了  多谢
<4-11,Sheldon>No, thank you.

174
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,350
<4-12,Leonard>简直像跟个吉娃娃一起住一样
<4-12,Leonard>It's like living with a Chihuahua.
