1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,630
<1-1,Sheldon>我最近读到在二战期间
<1-1,Sheldon>I recently read that during World War Two,

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,950
<1-1,Sheldon>约瑟夫·斯大林曾有一项研究计划
<1-1,Sheldon>Joseph Stalin had a research program

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,660
<1-1,Sheldon>为了制造超级士兵
<1-1,Sheldon>to create supersoldiers

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,040
<1-1,Sheldon>要让女人怀上大猩猩的孩子
<1-1,Sheldon>by having women impregnated by gorillas.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,150
<1-2,Howard>太变态的滥用科学了
<1-2,Howard>What a sick use of science.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,300
<1-3,Raj>只要孩子健康就没事啦
<1-3,Raj>Hey, as long as the baby's healthy.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,560
<1-4,Amy>不知道斯大林有没想过使用其他动物
<1-4,Amy>I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,580
<1-5,Leonard>河马是杀伤性最高的动物
<1-5,Leonard>Hippos are the deadliest creature.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,990
<1-5,Leonard>半人半河马应该会是狠角色吧
<1-5,Leonard>A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,850
<1-6,Howard>但当它们饿饿的时候
<1-6,Howard>Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry,

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,480
<1-6,Howard>你用弹珠就能阻止它们了
<1-6,Howard>you can stop them with marbles.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,020
<1-7,Sheldon>是的  制造跨族超级士兵的
<1-7,Sheldon>Yeah, the correct animal

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,960
<1-7,Sheldon>最佳选择是考拉
<1-7,Sheldon>for interspecies supersolider is koala.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,950
<1-7,Sheldon>你可以做出一个超可爱  让人无法下手的军队
<1-7,Sheldon>You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked.

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,650
<1-8,Raj>但半人半猫头鹰可以飞...
<1-8,Raj>But half-man, half-owl could fly...

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,290
<1-9,Sheldon>正解就是让人想抱的大扁鼻子士兵
<1-9,Sheldon>The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses.

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,540
<1-9,Sheldon>下个话题
<1-9,Sheldon>Moving on.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,540
<1-10,Howard>佩妮  新工作什么时候开始
<1-10,Howard>So, Penny, when's the new job start?

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,720
<1-11,Penny>下周一
<1-11,Penny>Next Monday.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,010
<1-12,Bernadette>你找时间看了我给你的材料了吗
<1-12,Bernadette>Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?

22
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,310
<1-13,Penny>还没  但我会看的
<1-13,Penny>Uh, not yet, but I will.

23
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,380
<1-14,Bernadette>很好  什么时候
<1-14,Bernadette>Great. When?

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,060
<1-15,Penny>我说了我会去看
<1-15,Penny>I said I'll get to it.

25
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,450
<1-16,Sheldon>我好像感觉到场面有些尴尬  是吧
<1-16,Sheldon>I'm sensing awkwardness, am I right?

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,420
<1-17,Amy>是的
<1-17,Amy>Yes.

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,600
<1-18,Sheldon>厉害
<1-18,Sheldon>Swish.

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,540
<1-19,Bernadette>我不想一直逼你
<1-19,Bernadette>I don't want to be pushy,

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,350
<1-19,Bernadette>但你之前从未接触过医药销售
<1-19,Bernadette>but you've never done pharmaceutical sales before.

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,850
<1-19,Bernadette>你可以用这段时间领先其他人啊
<1-19,Bernadette>It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.

31
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,450
<1-20,Penny>前几周都是在培训
<1-20,Penny>Well, the first few weeks will be all training.

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,120
<1-20,Penny>他们会教我一切需要了解的信息
<1-20,Penny>They'll tell me everything I need to know.

33
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,270
<1-21,Bernadette>但你想象一下  你去的时候已经对材料很熟
<1-21,Bernadette>But imagine how impressed they'd be if you showed up

34
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,180
<1-21,Bernadette>他们肯定会对你刮目相看
<1-21,Bernadette>already familiar with the material.

35
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,430
<1-22,Penny>所以是怎样  你想让我当老师的小马屁精吗
<1-22,Penny>Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher's pet?

36
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,240
<1-23,Bernadette>又没坏处
<1-23,Bernadette>Couldn't hurt.

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,080
<1-24,Leonard>不知道啊
<1-24,Leonard>Mm, I don't know.

38
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,140
<1-24,Leonard>在座这里有谁
<1-24,Leonard>Who here has ever been hurt

39
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,110
<1-24,Leonard>因为当老师的马屁精被欺负过
<1-24,Leonard>because they were the teacher's pet?

40
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,060
<1-25,Sheldon>感觉就像班上其他同学想要老师
<1-25,Sheldon>It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,430
<1-25,Sheldon>忘了有考试
<1-25,Sheldon>to forget the quiz.

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,000
<2-1,Sheldon>戴维斯小姐
<2-1,Sheldon>Mrs. Davis.

49
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,480
<2-1,Sheldon>你猜是谁
<2-1,Sheldon>Guess who?

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,850
<2-2,Mrs Davis>库伯博士
<2-2,Mrs Davis>Dr. Cooper.

51
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,940
<2-3,Sheldon>没错  干得好
<2-3,Sheldon>That's right, good job.

52
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,320
<2-3,Sheldon>你好
<2-3,Sheldon>Hello.

53
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,510
<2-3,Sheldon>你想见我吗
<2-3,Sheldon>Uh, you wanted to see me?

54
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,150
<2-4,Mrs Davis>是的  欢迎回来
<2-4,Mrs Davis>Yes. Uh, welcome back.

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,180
<2-5,Sheldon>谢谢
<2-5,Sheldon>Thank you.

56
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,280
<2-5,Sheldon>我想你想要再开始
<2-5,Sheldon>I assume you'd like to reopen our dialogue

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,200
<2-5,Sheldon>大学逼我继续研究弦理论的谈话是吗
<2-5,Sheldon>about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
<2-6,Mrs Davis>你是指谈话过程只有
<2-6,Mrs Davis>You mean the dialogue that went,

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,740
<2-6,Mrs Davis>"拜托""不行"这两个词来回重复的那次吗
<2-6,Mrs Davis>"Please?" "No." "Please?" "No." "Please?" "No."

60
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,410
<2-7,Sheldon>没错
<2-7,Sheldon>That's the one.

61
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,380
<2-7,Sheldon>我记得上一次最后是你回的  所以...  拜托
<2-7,Sheldon>I believe you went last, so, uh, please?

62
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,760
<2-8,Mrs Davis>库伯博士  在你不在的时候  我们想出了
<2-8,Mrs Davis>Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution

63
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,260
<2-8,Mrs Davis>让你可以改变研究领域的方法了
<2-8,Mrs Davis>that would allow you to change your field of study.

64
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,650
<2-9,Sheldon>撅嘴逃跑真的管用啊
<2-9,Sheldon>Pouting and running away actually worked.

65
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,050
<2-9,Sheldon>不得不说  你可千万记得
<2-9,Sheldon>Yeah, I must say, that may not be a lesson

66
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,800
<2-9,Sheldon>不要再逼我干嘛了
<2-9,Sheldon>you want to reinforce with me.

67
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,600
<2-9,Sheldon>所以解决方式是什么
<2-9,Sheldon>So, um, what is the solution?

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,690
<2-10,Mrs Davis>目前大学给你的研究基金是
<2-10,Mrs Davis>Currently, you're being paid under a grant

69
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,720
<2-10,Mrs Davis>只能做特定领域研究的
<2-10,Mrs Davis>to specifically research string theory.

70
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,030
<2-10,Mrs Davis>如果我们将你升为初级教授
<2-10,Mrs Davis>If we promote you to junior professor,

71
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,020
<2-10,Mrs Davis>这样你就能
<2-10,Mrs Davis>you'll be able to choose

72
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,010
<2-10,Mrs Davis>想研究什么就研究什么
<2-10,Mrs Davis>whatever field of research you'd like.

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,340
<2-11,Sheldon>但如果我是教授  我就得带学生了
<2-11,Sheldon>But if I'm a professor, then I'll have to teach a class.

74
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,660
<2-12,Mrs Davis>没错
<2-12,Mrs Davis>That is correct.

75
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,620
<2-13,Sheldon>所以你的解决方法就是  给我升职  给我加薪
<2-13,Sheldon>So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money

76
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,560
<2-13,Sheldon>然后让我能把我的学识
<2-13,Sheldon>so that I can impart my knowledge

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,640
<2-13,Sheldon>传授给下一代的科学家们吗
<2-13,Sheldon>to the next generation of scientists?

78
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,700
<2-14,Mrs Davis>没错
<2-14,Mrs Davis>Yes.

79
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,950
<2-15,Sheldon>你们这帮人真变态
<2-15,Sheldon>You people are sick.

80
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,670
<3-1,Penny>准备好去吃午饭了吗
<3-1,Penny>Hey. Ready to go to lunch?

81
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,710
<3-2,Amy>再给我一分钟
<3-2,Amy>Just give me a minute.

82
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,100
<3-2,Amy>我在刺激海星的快感细胞
<3-2,Amy>I'm stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish.

83
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,270
<3-2,Amy>等我关了就行了
<3-2,Amy>I just need to turn it off.

84
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,470
<3-3,Penny>如果你不关掉会怎么样
<3-3,Penny>What happens if you don't?

85
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,640
<3-4,Amy>那我就得边吃午饭
<3-4,Amy>Then I have to sit through lunch

86
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,350
<3-4,Amy>边想着这海星过得比我还"爽"
<3-4,Amy>knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am.

87
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,410
<3-4,Amy>伯纳黛特会在餐厅跟我们碰面吗
<3-4,Amy>Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?

88
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,350
<3-5,Penny>不会  其实我没叫她
<3-5,Penny>Uh, no. Actually, I didn't invite her.

89
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,250
<3-6,Amy>为什么
<3-6,Amy>How come?

90
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,290
<3-7,Penny>自从她介绍了我这份工作
<3-7,Penny>Well, ever since she helped me get this job,

91
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,990
<3-7,Penny>她就一直不停地烦我
<3-7,Penny>she won't stop bugging me.

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,280
<3-8,Amy>她只想你能做好这份工作
<3-8,Amy>Well, I think she just wants you to do well,

93
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,750
<3-8,Amy>而且她也担心你会失败吧
<3-8,Amy>and she's worried that you won't

94
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,200
<3-8,Amy>因为你真是个超烂的服务员
<3-8,Amy>'cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.

95
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,410
<3-9,Penny>才不是呢
<3-9,Penny>That is not true.

96
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,700
<3-10,Amy>我到现在都还在等两年前跟你点的玉米热狗呢
<3-10,Amy>I'm still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.

97
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,440
<3-11,Penny>我跟你说了  很快会给你上
<3-11,Penny>I told you, they'll be right out.

98
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,030
<3-12,Amy>好吧  没有伯纳黛特
<3-12,Amy>Okay, so no Bernadette.

99
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,700
<3-13,Penny>那晚你也看见她那个样子啦  难道是我错吗
<3-13,Penny>Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?

100
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,240
<3-13,Penny>没有啊  我只是...
<3-13,Penny>No, I just...

101
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,260
<3-14,Amy>我觉得这样说她有点不好
<3-14,Amy>I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this.

102
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,700
<3-14,Amy>通常有人在背后说其他人坏话时
<3-14,Amy>Usually when someone's being talked about behind their back,

103
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,500
<3-14,Amy>都是说我的坏话  而且还当着我的面说
<3-14,Amy>it's me and it's right in front of my face.

104
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,010
<3-15,Penny>抱歉  我只是想躲开她一阵子
<3-15,Penny>I-I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her.

105
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,330
<3-16,Amy>我懂
<3-16,Amy>I understand.

106
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,990
<3-16,Amy>你知道吗  有些研究显示
<3-16,Amy>You know, there is some research that indicates

107
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,100
<3-16,Amy>分享对第三方的负面看法
<3-16,Amy>that sharing negative attitudes about a third party

108
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,290
<3-16,Amy>能够加深两个朋友之间的友谊吗
<3-16,Amy>can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.

109
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,890
<3-17,Penny>所以你是什么意思
<3-17,Penny>So, what are you saying?

110
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,690
<3-18,Amy>我的意思是  为了科学
<3-18,Amy>I'm saying, in the spirit of science,

111
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,470
<3-18,Amy>那个小婊砸到底有啥好不满的
<3-18,Amy>what is that little skank's problem?

112
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,860
<4-1,Raj>我一直想给
<4-1,Raj>So, I've been trying to come up

113
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,360
<4-1,Raj>我和艾米丽取一个可爱的情侣昵称
<4-1,Raj>with a cute couple's nickname for me and Emily.

114
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,490
<4-1,Raj>你觉得哪一个好
<4-1,Raj>What do you like better--

115
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,000
<4-1,Raj>艾米帕里
<4-1,Raj>Emippali...

116
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,330
<4-1,Raj>还是库萨帕米丽
<4-1,Raj>or Koothrapemily?

117
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,250
<4-2,Howard>为什么一定是你的姓和她的名的组合
<4-2,Howard>Why is it your last name and her first name?

118
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,780
<4-3,Raj>她姓斯威尼
<4-3,Raj>Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney,

119
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,350
<4-3,Raj>库萨帕威尼听起来不大对劲儿
<4-3,Raj>and something just didn't seem right about Koothrapeeney.

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,320
<4-4,Leonard>跟人力资源部谈得怎么样了
<4-4,Leonard>Hey, how'd it go with human resources?

122
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,530
<4-5,Sheldon>很糟糕
<4-5,Sheldon>Awful.

123
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,920
<4-5,Sheldon>虽然他们同意让我研究其他理论
<4-5,Sheldon>Yeah, they're allowing me to move on from string theory,

124
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,750
<4-5,Sheldon>但是他们升我当初级教授
<4-5,Sheldon>but they made me a junior professor

125
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,980
<4-5,Sheldon>这样我就必须给学生上课
<4-5,Sheldon>and are requiring me to teach a class.

126
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,850
<4-6,Raj>我不明白了  上课有什么不好
<4-6,Raj>I don't understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?

127
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,110
<4-7,Sheldon>愚蠢的问题
<4-7,Sheldon>What a stupid question.

128
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,360
<4-8,Leonard>学生们绝对会"喜欢"他
<4-8,Leonard>The kids are gonna love him.

129
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,490
<4-9,Sheldon>我不敢相信我得浪费我的时间
<4-9,Sheldon>I can't believe I have to waste my time

130
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,580
<4-9,Sheldon>照顾一群研究生
<4-9,Sheldon>babysitting a bunch of grad students

131
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,460
<4-9,Sheldon>他们可能觉得暗物质就是尿片里的屎尿
<4-9,Sheldon>who probably think dark matter is what's in their diapers.

132
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,450
<4-10,Leonard>没那么糟糕
<4-10,Leonard>This might not be that bad.

133
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,320
<4-10,Leonard>你喜欢指出别人的错误
<4-10,Leonard>Uh, you like telling people they're wrong.

134
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,400
<4-10,Leonard>错
<4-10,Leonard>Wrong!

135
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,820
<4-11,Sheldon>我喜欢这么做  并不代表我会想整天这么做
<4-11,Sheldon>Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do.

136
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,750
<4-12,Raj>你喜欢给别人打分
<4-12,Raj>You enjoy giving people grades.

137
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,220
<4-13,Sheldon>观点正确  但是非原创  B-
<4-13,Sheldon>A valid point, but unoriginal-- B-minus.

138
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,010
<4-14,Howard>你喜欢你自己的声音
<4-14,Howard>And you love the sound of your own voice.

139
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,670
<4-15,Sheldon>对  没错  我喜欢
<4-15,Sheldon>Yeah, well, of course I do.

140
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,680
<4-15,Sheldon>听听
<4-15,Sheldon>Listen to it.

141
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,510
<4-15,Sheldon>就像听到了融化的焦糖
<4-15,Sheldon>It's like an earful of melted caramel.

142
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,460
<4-16,Leonard>最重要的是
<4-16,Leonard>Look, most importantly,

143
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,240
<4-16,Leonard>这样你才能继续研究暗物质
<4-16,Leonard>this will let you move on and study dark matter.

144
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,290
<4-17,Sheldon>我有很多偶像倒是都曾给予过
<4-17,Sheldon>It is true that many of my heroes have taken students

145
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,470
<4-17,Sheldon>学生帮助[放在翅膀下]
<4-17,Sheldon>under their wings:

146
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,980
<4-17,Sheldon>费因曼  爱因斯坦  X教授
<4-17,Sheldon>Feynman, Einstein, Professor X.

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,980
<4-17,Sheldon>费因曼  美国著名物理学家
<4-17,Sheldon>X教授  即查尔斯·塞维尔  X战警学校的校长及创办人

148
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,240
<4-17,Sheldon>有趣的是
<4-17,Sheldon>Humorously,

149
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,670
<4-17,Sheldon>对于X教授来说
<4-17,Sheldon>in the case of Professor X,

150
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,240
<4-17,Sheldon>他的一些学生还真的有翅膀
<4-17,Sheldon>some of his students actually had wings.

151
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,690
<4-17,Sheldon>真有意思
<4-17,Sheldon>That's rich.

152
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,600
<4-17,Sheldon>等全班学生在期中考试挂科之后
<4-17,Sheldon>I'll use that one to lighten the mood

153
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,360
<4-17,Sheldon>我会用这个笑话来逗笑他们
<4-17,Sheldon>after my entire class fails the midterm.

154
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,450
<5-1,Amy>通过使用1.2摩尔的快感细胞刺激
<5-1,Amy>Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to

155
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,510
<5-1,Amy>测量海星的血清素等级
<5-1,Amy>one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells.

156
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,730
<5-1,Amy>你喜欢这样对吧
<5-1,Amy>You like that, don't you?

157
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,530
<5-1,Amy>没错  说我的名字
<5-1,Amy>That's right, say my name.

158
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,740
<5-3,Amy>-还好吗  -还行
<5-3,Amy>- Hey, what's going on? - Not much.

159
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,070
<5-4,Bernadette>等会儿要去喝一杯吗
<5-4,Bernadette>You want to get a drink later?

160
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,250
<5-4,Bernadette>就我俩
<5-4,Bernadette>Just the two of us?

161
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,210
<5-5,Amy>不叫佩妮吗
<5-5,Amy>No Penny?

162
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,680
<5-6,Bernadette>今晚不叫她  我对她有点失望
<5-6,Bernadette>Not tonight. I'm a little frustrated with her.

163
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,300
<5-7,Amy>因为你帮她找到工作
<5-7,Amy>Because you got her the job and you think

164
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,460
<5-7,Amy>你觉得她应该好好准备
<5-7,Amy>she should be working harder to prepare for it?

165
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,170
<5-8,Bernadette>原来不光是我  你也看到了
<5-8,Bernadette>So it's not just me. You see it, too!

166
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,350
<5-9,Amy>对  我也看到了
<5-9,Amy>I do, I see it.

167
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,950
<5-10,Bernadette>快把我逼疯了
<5-10,Bernadette>It's driving me crazy.

168
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,030
<5-10,Bernadette>今天下午  我在她的相册里看见
<5-10,Bernadette>Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram

169
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,290
<5-10,Bernadette>她没有好好学习  还跑出去吃午餐
<5-10,Bernadette>that instead of studying, she went out to lunch

170
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,050
<5-10,Bernadette>还去做了美甲
<5-10,Bernadette>and got a manicure.

171
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,930
<5-11,Amy>太过分了
<5-11,Amy>That's outrageous!

172
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,760
<5-12,Bernadette>对啊
<5-12,Bernadette>I know!

173
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
<5-13,Amy>如果她做不好
<5-13,Amy>If she doesn't do well,

174
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
<5-13,Amy>也会坏了你的名声
<5-13,Amy>th-this could reflect poorly on you.

175
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,100
<5-14,Bernadette>是啊  她是不知道  还是不在乎
<5-14,Bernadette>Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?

176
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,350
<5-14,Bernadette>我不知道
<5-14,Bernadette>I don't know.

177
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,830
<5-15,Amy>重要的是  我支持你
<5-15,Amy>The important thing is I am here for you

178
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,860
<5-15,Amy>所以我们可以一起鄙视这个讨厌的第三方
<5-15,Amy>so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.

179
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,670
<6-1,Leonard>我们来看看你的课上得怎么样了
<6-1,Leonard>Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going.

180
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,050
<6-1,Leonard>学生呢
<6-1,Leonard>Where is everybody?

181
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,990
<6-2,Sheldon>没有学生
<6-2,Sheldon>There is no class.

182
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,970
<6-3,Howard>你这么快就把所有人都送去校长办公室了吗
<6-3,Howard>Did you send everyone to the principal's office already?

183
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,450
<6-4,Sheldon>没人报名
<6-4,Sheldon>No one signed up.

184
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,640
<6-5,Leonard>这不是你的错
<6-5,Leonard>Well, that's not your fault.

185
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,620
<6-6,Sheldon>我打电话问学院秘书是怎么回事
<6-6,Sheldon>I called the department secretary to see what happened.

186
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,320
<6-6,Sheldon>显然  全校的人都认为我很讨厌
<6-6,Sheldon>Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.

187
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,950
<6-7,Leonard>不会吧
<6-7,Leonard>What?

188
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,090
<6-8,Raj>谢尔顿  真是抱歉
<6-8,Raj>Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.

189
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,640
<6-9,Sheldon>别  没事的
<6-9,Sheldon>No, it's fine.

190
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,400
<6-9,Sheldon>现在我可以全身心投入到暗物质的研究中了
<6-9,Sheldon>Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.

191
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,650
<6-10,Raj>你还给大家带了饼干
<6-10,Raj>Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?

192
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,680
<6-11,Sheldon>对  "无花果牛顿"饼干
<6-11,Sheldon>Oh, yes. Fig Newtons.

193
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,700
<6-11,Sheldon>我本来打算问他们  哪个科学家
<6-11,Sheldon>I was going to ask them: which scientist both helped

194
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,550
<6-11,Sheldon>既对微积分有贡献
<6-11,Sheldon>to develop calculus

195
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,230
<6-11,Sheldon>又有一款饼干以他命名
<6-11,Sheldon>and had a famous cookie named after him?

196
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,030
<6-11,Sheldon>等有人回答"牛顿"
<6-11,Sheldon>And then after someone said "Newton,"

197
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,000
<6-11,Sheldon>我就告诉他们错了
<6-11,Sheldon>I was going to tell them they're wrong.

198
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,180
<6-11,Sheldon>这个饼干是用马萨诸塞州的一个镇命名的
<6-11,Sheldon>The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts.

199
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,840
<6-11,Sheldon>然后我再把饼干扔了
<6-11,Sheldon>And then I'd throw the cookies away.

200
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,150
<6-12,Howard>我来听你的课怎么样
<6-12,Howard>Hey, what if I took your class?

201
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,790
<6-13,Sheldon>你为什么这么做
<6-13,Sheldon>Why would you do that?

202
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,630
<6-14,Leonard>-你为什么这么做  -你脑子出什么问题
<6-14,Leonard>- Yeah, why would you do that? - What's wrong with you?

203
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,930
<6-16,Howard>我想拿到博士学位
<6-16,Howard>I'm thinking about getting my doctorate,

204
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,440
<6-16,Howard>他想要教课  正好啊
<6-16,Howard>and he wants to teach-- why not?

205
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,280
<6-17,Sheldon>霍华德
<6-17,Sheldon>Oh, Howard.

206
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,970
<6-17,Sheldon>感谢你的提议
<6-17,Sheldon>I appreciate the gesture,

207
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,090
<6-17,Sheldon>但这是研究生阶段的物理课程
<6-17,Sheldon>but this is a graduate-level physics class.

208
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,890
<6-17,Sheldon>我觉得你根本无法理解
<6-17,Sheldon>I don't think you'd understand

209
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,130
<6-17,Sheldon>我所讲的任何内容
<6-17,Sheldon>a single thing I was talking about.

210
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,300
<6-18,Raj>再问一遍为什么不能来  我有答案了
<6-18,Raj>Ask why not again; I've got an answer.

211
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,470
<6-19,Howard>谢尔顿  我的智商来听你的课绰绰有余了
<6-19,Howard>Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough to take your class.

212
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,930
<6-20,Sheldon>不可能
<6-20,Sheldon>No.

213
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,430
<6-21,Howard>真的
<6-21,Howard>Yes.

214
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,110
<6-22,Sheldon>在没有精确解的情况下
<6-22,Sheldon>How would you determine the ground state

215
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,060
<6-22,Sheldon>你如何确定量子系统的基态
<6-22,Sheldon>of a quantum system with no exact solution?

216
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,520
<6-23,Howard>我会任意猜测一个基态波函数  通过更改其参数
<6-23,Howard>I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters

217
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,870
<6-23,Howard>找出能量最低的量子态
<6-23,Howard>until I found the lowest energy solution.

218
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,340
<6-24,Sheldon>你知道怎么不查书也能求出
<6-24,Sheldon>Do you know how to integrate X squared times E

219
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,560
<6-24,Sheldon>x平方乘e到负x的积分
<6-24,Sheldon>to the minus X, without looking it up?

220
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,330
<6-25,Howard>我会用费曼的秘诀
<6-25,Howard>I'd use Feynman's trick--

221
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,200
<6-25,Howard>积分符号内取微分
<6-25,Howard>differentiate under the integral sign.

222
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,040
<6-25,Howard>不错嘛
<6-25,Howard>Okay.

223
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,500
<6-26,Sheldon>量子力学的正确诠释是什么
<6-26,Sheldon>What is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?

224
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,600
<6-27,Howard>每一种诠释对于每一次测量
<6-27,Howard>Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer

225
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,350
<6-27,Howard>给出的答案都一样  所以它们同等正确
<6-27,Howard>to every measurement, they are all equally correct.

226
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,680
<6-27,Howard>但是我知道你支持的是多宇宙诠释
<6-27,Howard>However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation,

227
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,890
<6-27,Howard>所以我会顺着你说  现在你觉得我够聪明了吗
<6-27,Howard>so I'll say that. Now do you think I'm smart enough?

228
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,380
<6-28,Sheldon>不
<6-28,Sheldon>No.

229
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,790
<6-29,Howard>拜托  你也许就比我
<6-29,Howard>Oh, come on. You might've gone to school

230
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,680
<6-29,Howard>多上了几年学  但是
<6-29,Howard>for a couple more years than me, but guess what--

231
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,210
<6-29,Howard>工程师和物理学家一样聪明
<6-29,Howard>engineers are just as smart as physicists.

232
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,060
<6-30,Sheldon>你把这话收回去
<6-30,Sheldon>You take that back!

233
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,080
<6-30,Sheldon>不
<6-30,Sheldon>No.

234
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,310
<7-1,Amy>和伯纳黛特喝了几杯后
<7-1,Amy>So, after drinks with Bernadette,

235
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,300
<7-1,Amy>我刚到家  佩妮就打来电话抱怨伯纳黛特
<7-1,Amy>I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her.

236
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,380
<7-1,Amy>我正和佩妮说着呢
<7-1,Amy>And then while I'm talking to Penny,

237
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,840
<7-1,Amy>伯纳黛特又发来短信
<7-1,Amy>I get a text from Bernadette.

238
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,890
<7-2,Sheldon>我正为霍华德准备教学计划呢
<7-2,Sheldon>Wh... I'm trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard.

239
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,730
<7-2,Sheldon>你干嘛告诉我这些废话
<7-2,Sheldon>Why are you telling me this?

240
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,390
<7-3,Amy>因为虽然晚了15年
<7-3,Amy>Because it's taken 15 years,

241
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,080
<7-3,Amy>但高中生活终于开始精彩了
<7-3,Amy>but high school is finally awesome!

242
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,480
<7-3,Amy>虽然我爱她们俩
<7-3,Amy>I love them both,

243
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,910
<7-3,Amy>但现在我成了团体中心  我更爱这种感觉
<7-3,Amy>but I'm in the center now, and I love that even more.

244
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,250
<7-4,Sheldon>艾米  拜托  我正努力寻找
<7-4,Sheldon>Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way

245
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,770
<7-4,Sheldon>一种用智力阉割我好友的方法
<7-4,Sheldon>to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.

246
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,550
<7-6,Sheldon>-可人家...  -别烦我了
<7-6,Sheldon>- But I'm just... - Not now.

247
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,210
<7-7,Amy>注意你的态度  老弟
<7-7,Amy>You better watch that attitude, buddy.

248
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,280
<7-7,Amy>你女朋友现在可是校园红人呢
<7-7,Amy>You're dating the popular girl now.

249
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,450
<8-1,Leonard>你还没睡啊
<8-1,Leonard>You're up late.

250
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,370
<8-2,Sheldon>我在为沃罗威茨量身定制教学计划
<8-2,Sheldon>Oh, I'm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz.

251
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,440
<8-2,Sheldon>保证他跟听天书一样
<8-2,Sheldon>He is going to be so lost.

252
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,770
<8-2,Sheldon>快看这部分内容
<8-2,Sheldon>Look at this section over here.

253
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,290
<8-2,Sheldon>连我都不懂是什么
<8-2,Sheldon>Even I don't really understand it.

254
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,630
<8-3,Leonard>谢尔顿  你为什么要这么做
<8-3,Leonard>Sheldon, why are you doing this?

255
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,160
<8-4,Sheldon>我是一名教师  莱纳德
<8-4,Sheldon>I'm a teacher, Leonard.

256
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,490
<8-4,Sheldon>这是我的工作
<8-4,Sheldon>It's my job.

257
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,640
<8-5,Leonard>不  我是说
<8-5,Leonard>No, I-I mean,

258
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,030
<8-5,Leonard>你为什么要费尽周折
<8-5,Leonard>why are you going to so much trouble

259
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,990
<8-5,Leonard>来证明你比沃罗威茨聪明呢
<8-5,Leonard>to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz?

260
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,480
<8-6,Sheldon>完全不费劲  我高兴着呢
<8-6,Sheldon>Oh, it's no trouble; it's actually a pleasure.

261
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,830
<8-7,Leonard>你知道我怎么想吗
<8-7,Leonard>You want to know what I think?

262
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,170
<8-7,Leonard>我觉得一想到某人可能和你一样聪明
<8-7,Leonard>I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you,

263
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,970
<8-7,Leonard>甚至比你聪明  你就怕得要死
<8-7,Leonard>or even smarter, scares the pants off you,

264
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,600
<8-7,Leonard>你接受不了这个事实
<8-7,Leonard>and you can't deal with it.

265
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,110
<8-8,Sheldon>想法很有趣
<8-8,Sheldon>Interesting point.

266
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,080
<8-8,Sheldon>你是在暗示
<8-8,Sheldon>Wh... You're suggesting

267
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,350
<8-8,Sheldon>潜意识里我的情绪
<8-8,Sheldon>that I have emotional issues below my consciousness

268
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,220
<8-8,Sheldon>影响了我的行动
<8-8,Sheldon>which drive my behavior,

269
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,360
<8-8,Sheldon>导致我大肆打击任何
<8-8,Sheldon>thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone

270
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,350
<8-8,Sheldon>威胁到我智商优势的人或事吗
<8-8,Sheldon>that threatens my intellectual superiority.

271
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,620
<8-9,Leonard>你好好思考一下吧
<8-9,Leonard>Might be something to think about.

272
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,550
<8-10,Sheldon>-莱纳德  -什么
<8-10,Sheldon>- Leonard? - Yeah.

273
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,080
<8-12,Sheldon>霍华德对花生过敏
<8-12,Sheldon>Howard's allergic to peanuts.

274
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,760
<8-12,Sheldon>我怎样才能用这个对付他
<8-12,Sheldon>How can I use that against him?

275
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,270
<9-2,Sheldon>既然大家都来齐了  我们可以上课了
<9-2,Sheldon>Okay, now that everyone's here, we can begin.

276
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,020
<9-3,Howard>上课之前我要说  我刚和莱纳德谈过了
<9-3,Howard>Before we do, I just talked to Leonard.

277
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,470
<9-3,Howard>如果你准备
<9-3,Howard>And if you're gonna

278
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,750
<9-3,Howard>刻意让这门课难到超乎常理
<9-3,Howard>spend all your time trying to belittle me

279
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,700
<9-3,Howard>以此来贬低我的智商的话
<9-3,Howard>by making this class unnecessarily hard,

280
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,660
<9-3,Howard>那我不上了
<9-3,Howard>then I'm out.

281
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,780
<9-3,Howard>但如果你真心想要
<9-3,Howard>But if you're interested in making

282
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,480
<9-3,Howard>做一个好老师
<9-3,Howard>a sincere effort to be a good teacher,

283
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,810
<9-3,Howard>那我也愿意给你个机会
<9-3,Howard>then I'm willing to give this a shot.

284
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,190
<9-4,Sheldon>这个提议很合理
<9-4,Sheldon>I suppose that's a fair request.

285
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,470
<9-4,Sheldon>我们俩都可以从这件事里受益
<9-4,Sheldon>There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience.

286
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,530
<9-5,Howard>-好吧  -就这样
<9-5,Howard>- Okay. - Okay.

287
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,200
<9-6,Sheldon>那我们先上课
<9-6,Sheldon>Well, then, uh, first things first.

288
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,240
<9-6,Sheldon>你对最速降线问题熟悉吗
<9-6,Sheldon>Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?

289
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,540
<9-7,Howard>-很熟悉  -很好
<9-7,Howard>- I am. - Good.

290
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,170
<9-8,Sheldon>那它和变分法之间的关系呢
<9-8,Sheldon>And how it relates to the calculus of variations?

291
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,720
<9-9,Howard>是一条翻转摆线
<9-9,Howard>It's an inverted cycloid.

292
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,640
<9-10,Sheldon>不错不错
<9-10,Sheldon>Wonderful.

293
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,000
<9-10,Sheldon>那么  你了解欧拉拉格朗日定理吗
<9-10,Sheldon>Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?

294
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,460
<9-11,Howard>这我就有点小困惑了
<9-11,Howard>That's where I'm a little fuzzy.

295
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,370
<9-12,Sheldon>我就知道  好了
<9-12,Sheldon>Ha! I knew it! All right.

296
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,190
<9-12,Sheldon>在第一次考试前  我们需要大量补充这方面的知识
<9-12,Sheldon>We have a lot of information to cover before your first test.

297
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,580
<9-12,Sheldon>对了  考试就在8分钟之后
<9-12,Sheldon>Which, by the way, is in eight minutes.

298
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,240
<9-12,Sheldon>好消息是我的评分标准是曲线评分
<9-12,Sheldon>The good news is I'm grading on a curve,

299
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,470
<9-12,Sheldon>所以你卷子上肯定有个"C"
<9-12,Sheldon>so you're pretty much guaranteed a C.

300
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,790
<9-13,Howard (singing)>* 老子这辈子只想赢 *
<9-13,Howard (singing)>* All I do is win, win, win *

302
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,050
<9-13,Howard (singing)>* 无论如何 *
<9-13,Howard (singing)>* No matter what *

303
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,830

<9-14,Sheldon>What are you doing?

304
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,380
<9-15,Howard (singing)>* 大家一起高举双手 *
<9-15,Howard (singing)>* Everybody hands go up, up... *

305
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,190
<9-15,Howard (singing)>* 保持别动 *
<9-15,Howard (singing)>* And they stay there! *

306
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,440
<9-14,Sheldon>你在干什么
<9-14,Sheldon>What are you doing?

307
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,480
<9-17,Howard>如果你要当个烂老师
<9-17,Howard>If you're gonna be a crappy teacher,

308
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,500
<9-17,Howard>那我就当个烂学生
<9-17,Howard>then I'm gonna be a crappy student.

309
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,050
<9-17,Howard>* 路达克里斯来唱副歌 *
<9-17,Howard>* Ludacris going in on the verse *

310
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,600
<9-17,Howard>* 我无所不胜  永不停止 *
<9-17,Howard>*'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now..*

311
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,770
<9-18,Sheldon>停下来
<9-18,Sheldon>Will you stop it!

312
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,980
<9-18,Sheldon>这是教室
<9-18,Sheldon>This is a classroom.

313
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,550
<9-18,Sheldon>不是《美国大舞台》  好了
<9-18,Sheldon>This is not American Bandstand. Okay.

314
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,790
<9-20,Sheldon>好了  我说到哪里呢
<9-20,Sheldon>Now, where was I?

315
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,620
<9-20,Sheldon>我看看
<9-20,Sheldon>Let's see.

<9-20,Sheldon>You...

318
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,540
<9-21,Howard>你又在干什么
<9-21,Howard>What are you doing now?

319
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,800
<9-21,Howard>折一个吸管
<9-21,Howard>Making a straw.

320
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,880
<9-22,Sheldon>为什么
<9-22,Sheldon>Why?

321
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,670
<9-23,Howard>我就可以用口水球射你了
<9-23,Howard>So I can shoot you with a spitball.

322
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,950
<9-24,Sheldon>你不能这么做  我来告诉你为什么
<9-24,Sheldon>You're not going to do that, and I'll tell you why.

323
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,280
<9-24,Sheldon>这里是高等学府的课堂
<9-24,Sheldon>This is an institution of higher learning,

324
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,790
<9-24,Sheldon>我是你的教授
<9-24,Sheldon>I am your professor,

325
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,010
<9-24,Sheldon>你对待我的态度应该是...
<9-24,Sheldon>and you're going to treat me with the prop...

326
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,450
<9-24,Sheldon>你的口水吐进我的嘴里了
<9-24,Sheldon>You shot your spit in my mouth!

327
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,720
<9-25,Howard>考试会考这个吗
<9-25,Howard>Is that gonna be on the test?

328
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,680
<9-25,Howard>我想我没法再做到一次了
<9-25,Howard>Because I don't think I can do that again.

329
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,010
<10-1,Amy (on phone)>好闺蜜

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,740
<10-5,Amy>你又不是单车
<10-5,Amy>I mean, you're not a bicycle;

341
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,300
<10-5,Amy>她凭什么这样"骑压"你
<10-5,Amy>why's she riding you like that?

342
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,710
<10-6,Penny>不  我想她只是想帮忙
<10-6,Penny>No, I think she was just trying to help.

343
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,950
<10-6,Penny>而且  我想做好这份工作
<10-6,Penny>Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So...

<10-10,Bernadette>听起来很好玩  但我答应了佩妮
<10-10,Bernadette>That sounds fun, but I promised Penny

351
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,180
<10-10,Bernadette>过去帮助她学习
<10-10,Bernadette>I'd come by and help her study.

<10-11,Amy>那只能祝你好运逮到她
<10-11,Amy>Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that.

353
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,740
<10-11,Amy>她可能又出去修指甲了
<10-11,Amy>She's probably off getting another manicure.

354
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,970
<10-11,Amy>你记得她那次这样做吗
<10-11,Amy>You remember when she did that?

355
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,030
<10-11,Amy>记得吗
<10-11,Amy>You remember?

356
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,390
<10-12,Bernadette>我可能对她太严厉了
<10-12,Bernadette>I was probably being too hard on her.

357
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,960
<10-12,Bernadette>我们谈过了  没事了
<10-12,Bernadette>We talked, we're good.

360
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,810
<10-13,Amy>你俩合不来时
<10-13,Amy>You know, when the two of you aren't getting along,

361
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,860
<10-13,Amy>我夹在中间  好难做人啊
