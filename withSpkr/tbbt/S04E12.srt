1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,930
<1-1,Howard>老妈  淡定
<1-1,Howard>Ma, Ma, calm down.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,880
<1-1,Howard>听我说
<1-1,Howard>Listen to me.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,080
<1-1,Howard>我知道上面说着用鼠标点击
<1-1,Howard>I know it says click with the mouse,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,030
<1-1,Howard>但在笔记本电脑上  触控板就相当于鼠标了
<1-1,Howard>but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,530
<1-1,Howard>现在  把你的手指放上去
<1-1,Howard>Now, put your finger on it.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,510
<1-1,Howard>无所谓用哪根手指
<1-1,Howard>Doesn't matter which finger.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,380
<1-1,Howard>明智的选择
<1-1,Howard>Good choice.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,550
<1-1,Howard>现在把指针移到电子邮件图标上
<1-1,Howard>Now move it down to your e-mail icon.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,910
<1-1,Howard>对  就是那个小信封图标
<1-1,Howard>Yeah, the little envelope.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,960
<1-1,Howard>什么叫"它长什么样"
<1-1,Howard>What do you mean, "What does it look like?"

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,990
<1-1,Howard>它当然长个信封样!
<1-1,Howard>It looks like an envelope!

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,470
<1-1,Howard>行啊  你要是不喜欢电脑
<1-1,Howard>Fine, you don't like the computer,

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,740
<1-1,Howard>那就别用了
<1-1,Howard>don't use it!

14
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,060
<1-1,Howard>行啊  我们可以换个沙拉搅拌机  再见
<1-1,Howard>Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,560
<1-2,Raj>这就是你一直后悔买的那个光明节礼物吧
<1-2,Raj>That's a Hanukkah present you're regretting, huh?

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,160
<1-3,Sheldon>我不能说所有无法掌握当代技术的
<1-3,Sheldon>I won't say that all senior citizens

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,610
<1-3,Sheldon>老年人就应该被当众鞭策一番
<1-3,Sheldon>who can't master technology should be publicly flogged,

19
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,680
<1-3,Sheldon>但倘若我们拿一两位作为案例
<1-3,Sheldon>but if we made an example of one or two,

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,470
<1-3,Sheldon>或许能更好的鞭策他人努力学习呢
<1-3,Sheldon>it might give the others incentive to try harder.

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,890
<1-3,Sheldon>我有个好主意
<1-3,Sheldon>I had a great idea.

22
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,940
<1-4,Leonard>我们总会被迫停下工作
<1-4,Leonard>You know how we're always having

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,270
<1-4,Leonard>去解某些微分方程式吧
<1-4,Leonard>to stop and solve differential equations,

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,940
<1-4,Leonard>比如你做傅里叶分析的时候
<1-4,Leonard>like when you're doing Fourier analysis,

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,920
<1-4,Leonard>或是用到薛定谔方程的时候
<1-4,Leonard>or using the Schr dinger equation?

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,760
<1-5,Sheldon>霍华德用不到那个  他只不过是个工程师
<1-5,Sheldon>Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,800
<1-6,Leonard>我一直在想其实我们可以写个小程序
<1-6,Leonard>I was thinking, we could write a little app

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,360
<1-6,Leonard>通过使用手写识别技术
<1-6,Leonard>that would use handwriting recognition,

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,710
<1-6,Leonard>然后通过一个符号运算引擎来计算
<1-6,Leonard>and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine.

30
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,180
<1-6,Leonard>这样  只要你使用你的智能手机
<1-6,Leonard>You just use your smartphone,

31
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,490
<1-6,Leonard>把你的方程式拍出来后就迎刃而解了
<1-6,Leonard>take a picture of the equation and bam!

32
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,650
<1-7,Raj>你们知道什么应用程序算牛吗  能制造放屁声的程序
<1-7,Raj>You know what's a great app? The one that makes fart noises.

33
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,090
<1-8,Sheldon>知道吗  莱纳德
<1-8,Sheldon>You know, Leonard,

34
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,070
<1-8,Sheldon>那的确是个可行的主意
<1-8,Sheldon>that's actually a valid idea.

35
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,900
<1-8,Sheldon>真的不错哦
<1-8,Sheldon>Very good.

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,860
<1-9,Leonard>你的口吻能否别弄得像是"我是一只刚学会
<1-9,Leonard>Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,200
<1-9,Leonard>如何上厕所的猫"似的
<1-9,Leonard>who learned how to use the toilet?

38
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,590
<1-9,Leonard>不行
<1-9,Leonard>No.

39
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,470
<1-10,Sheldon>两项成就都让人感到啧啧称奇
<1-10,Sheldon>The two achievements are equally surprising

40
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,820
<1-10,Sheldon>同样令人钦佩
<1-10,Sheldon>and equally admirable,

41
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,840
<1-10,Sheldon>但如果要选的话
<1-10,Sheldon>though if pressed,

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,510
<1-10,Sheldon>我不得不说那只猫的成就更胜一筹
<1-10,Sheldon>I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat.

43
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,540
<1-10,Sheldon>我还是拯救你于水火之中
<1-10,Sheldon>I'll save you the pain and nervousness

44
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,270
<1-10,Sheldon>给你一个你期待已久的答案吧
<1-10,Sheldon>of waiting for the answer.

45
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,730
<1-10,Sheldon>我同意参与你的计划  恭喜你
<1-10,Sheldon>I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,230
<1-11,Leonard>我的荣幸啊
<1-11,Leonard>Oh, yay for me.

47
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,240
<1-11,Leonard>你们怎么说
<1-11,Leonard>What about you guys?

48
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,320
<1-11,Leonard>我不敢保证什么
<1-11,Leonard>I can't promise anything,

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,790
<1-11,Leonard>但有人就用这种东西赚到过钱呢
<1-11,Leonard>but people do make money off stuff like this.

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,700
<1-12,Howard>能赚点外快也是不错的选择
<1-12,Howard>A few extra bucks would be nice.

51
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,850
<1-12,Howard>我终于能从我妈家搬出去了
<1-12,Howard>I could finally move out of my mother's house.

52
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,730
<1-13,Raj>你搬到哪去呢
<1-13,Raj>Where would you go?

53
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,630
<1-14,Howard>我一直梦想着能在车库上面
<1-14,Howard>I always dreamed about

54
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,840
<1-14,Howard>搭造起属于自己的小天地
<1-14,Howard>building a little place of my own over the garage

55
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,270
<1-15,Raj>如果我挣到更多的钱  我就能从工作中抽身
<1-15,Raj>You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work

56
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,960
<1-15,Raj>带着美女来一趟潜艇之旅了
<1-15,Raj>and give pretty girls submarine rides.

57
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,690
<1-15,Raj>那是什么玩意
<1-15,Raj>What's that?

58
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,820
<1-16,Howard>某种诡异的性爱方式吗
<1-16,Howard>Some weird sex thing?

59
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,000
<1-16,Howard>不是啊
<1-16,Howard>No.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,250
<1-17,Raj>就是你带着美女坐在你的
<1-17,Raj>You take pretty girls underwater

61
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,020
<1-17,Raj>私人潜艇里  让她们欣赏鱼儿
<1-17,Raj>in your private submarine, and you show them fish.

62
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,040
<1-17,Raj>为什么所有事到你这都要龌龊一下
<1-17,Raj>Why does everything have to be dirty with you?

63
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,030
<1-18,Leonard>我想我们可以在晚上一起做这个
<1-18,Leonard>I was thinking we could work on this at night,

64
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,530
<1-18,Leonard>也许经过几周的努力后
<1-18,Leonard>and then maybe in a couple of weeks,

65
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,380
<1-18,Leonard>就能有我们自己的应用程序贩售了
<1-18,Leonard>we'll have ourselves an app to sell.

66
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,890
<1-19,Howard>我们这听起来像是在做生意啊
<1-19,Howard>Sounds like we're in business.

67
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,990
<1-20,Raj>我认为我们应该拍一张  留住这精彩的瞬间
<1-20,Raj>I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.

68
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,670
<1-21,Leonard>-好啊  -哦
<1-21,Leonard>- Yeah. - Oh!

69
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,120
<1-22,Sheldon>你们说  这是不是我99美分花的最值的一次
<1-22,Sheldon>Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?

70
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
<1-23,Raj (pressing button on camera phone. Camera makes a fart noise)>生活大爆炸
<1-23,Raj (pressing button on camera phone. Camera makes a fart noise)>第四季第十二集

71
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,000
<2-1,Leonard>我查过应用商店了
<2-1,Leonard>I checked the App Store.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,920
<2-1,Leonard>还没人做过
<2-1,Leonard>No one is doing

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,510
<2-1,Leonard>手写识别解微分方程的应用程序呢
<2-1,Leonard>handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.

75
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,850
<2-2,Sheldon>天呐  你小声点
<2-2,Sheldon>Oh, dear Lord, shush.

76
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,880
<2-3,Leonard>为什么
<2-3,Leonard>What?

77
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,560
<2-4,Sheldon>你好不容易能有个好点子  莱纳德
<2-4,Sheldon>You have so few good ideas, Leonard.

78
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,850
<2-4,Sheldon>你打算就这么轻易地把它
<2-4,Sheldon>And you're just going to spill the beans

79
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,220
<2-4,Sheldon>当着一个外人的面泄露出去吗
<2-4,Sheldon>in front of an outsider?

80
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,260
<2-5,Penny>说谁呢  我吗
<2-5,Penny>Who, me?

81
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
<2-6,Howard>谢尔顿  我不觉得佩妮
<2-6,Howard>Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,690
<2-6,Howard>多在乎这个基于手写识别技术的微分...
<2-6,Howard>about handwriting-recognition based differential...

83
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,340
<2-7,Sheldon (singing)>*夜晚的星星大而亮呀*
<2-7,Sheldon (singing)>*The stars at night are big and bright*

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,790
<2-7,Sheldon (singing)>*深深地埋藏在德州的中央*
<2-7,Sheldon (singing)>*Deep in the heart of Texas*

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,410
<2-8,Leonard>她不会来盗取我们的点子
<2-8,Leonard>She's not going to steal our idea.

86
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,980
<2-10,Leonard>-什么点子  -我们要写一个应用程序...
<2-10,Leonard>- What idea? - We're gonna write an application...

87
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,680
<2-11,Sheldon (singing)>*草原的星空宽而高呀*
<2-11,Sheldon (singing)>*The prairie sky is wide and high*

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,720
<2-11,Sheldon (singing)>*深深地埋藏在...*
<2-11,Sheldon (singing)>*Deep in the heart...*

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,320
<2-12,Penny>行了  别唱了
<2-12,Penny>Okay, stop, stop!

90
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
<2-13,Sheldon>*德州的中央*
<2-13,Sheldon>*Of Texas*

91
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,770
<2-14,Penny>无论你们的秘密是什么
<2-14,Penny>Whatever your secret is,

92
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,980
<2-14,Penny>我确信它必定无聊至极  所以我不会有兴趣的
<2-14,Penny>I'm sure it's boring, so I'm not interested.

93
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,180
<2-15,Leonard>一点也不无聊啊
<2-15,Leonard>It's not boring at all.

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,490
<2-15,Leonard>你想想  在高阶数学中
<2-15,Leonard>You see, in higher order mathematics,

95
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,340
<2-15,Leonard>一定会有
<2-15,Leonard>there are certain sets

96
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,320
<2-15,Leonard>-联立方程组  它们有时...  -无聊
<2-15,Leonard>- of equations that... - Bored.

97
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,110
<2-17,Leonard>满意了吗
<2-17,Leonard>Satisfied?

98
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,980
<2-18,Sheldon>恐怕很难
<2-18,Sheldon>Hardly.

99
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,060
<2-18,Sheldon>试想一下这个不太可能却又非常真实的情节吧
<2-18,Sheldon>Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario.

100
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,030
<2-18,Sheldon>一位年轻女子只身来到大都市
<2-18,Sheldon>A young woman alone in the big city.

101
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,260
<2-18,Sheldon>她荒谬的演员梦想
<2-18,Sheldon>Her ridiculous dream

102
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,110
<2-18,Sheldon>欺骗了她  从而深深地打击了她
<2-18,Sheldon>of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.

103
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,720
<2-19,Penny>拜托  你停一下好吗
<2-19,Penny>Hey, wait a minute.

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,430
<2-20,Howard>等等  我们看看他的后续如何
<2-20,Howard>Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.

105
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,170
<2-21,Sheldon>然后现实打击了她
<2-21,Sheldon>Then it hits her.

106
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,860
<2-21,Sheldon>她如何才能生存下去呢
<2-21,Sheldon>How is she going to survive?

107
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,260
<2-21,Sheldon>因为她胸无大志且身无长物
<2-21,Sheldon>I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills.

108
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,810
<2-21,Sheldon>直到有一天
<2-21,Sheldon>And then one day,

109
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,090
<2-21,Sheldon>她遇到了一群天才们
<2-21,Sheldon>she meets a group of geniuses

110
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,190
<2-21,Sheldon>以及天才们的朋友霍华德
<2-21,Sheldon>and their friend Howard.

111
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,720
<2-22,Howard>我...
<2-22,Howard>Hey, I...

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,660
<2-23,Penny>你也等等  我们看看他的后续如何
<2-23,Penny>Hang on. Let's see where he's going.

113
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,730
<2-24,Sheldon>她与这帮人交朋友  然后伺机等候
<2-24,Sheldon>She befriends them, and then lies in wait

114
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,130
<2-24,Sheldon>直到这帮人有了一个可销售的点子
<2-24,Sheldon>until they reveal a marketable idea,

115
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,380
<2-24,Sheldon>于是她盗取了点子  卖给了出价最高的人
<2-24,Sheldon>which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.

116
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,520
<2-25,Leonard>-这也太扯了  -哦  是吗
<2-25,Leonard>- That is ridiculous. - Oh, is it?

117
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,130
<2-26,Sheldon>那你倒是给我们个合理的解释
<2-26,Sheldon>Let's see you come up with an explanation

118
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,750
<2-26,Sheldon>为何这个女人一直跟我们厮混在一起
<2-26,Sheldon>as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.

119
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,710
<2-27,Penny>太棒了  你们知道吗
<2-27,Penny>Oh, great. You know what?

120
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,150
<2-27,Penny>我已经从你们这蹭到晚饭了
<2-27,Penny>I've already mooched dinner off you guys.

121
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,790
<2-27,Penny>所以我不需要再听这个点子了
<2-27,Penny>I don't need to listen to this.

122
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,310
<2-28,Howard>这就是你要的答案  免费食物
<2-28,Howard>There's your answer-- free food.

123
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,290
<2-29,Sheldon>好吧  我已经自作主张
<2-29,Sheldon>All right, I've taken the liberty

124
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,920
<2-29,Sheldon>起草了这些工作流程图
<2-29,Sheldon>of drafting these workflow charts

125
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,020
<2-29,Sheldon>这里列出了我们形形色色的职务以及
<2-29,Sheldon>which outline our various duties and the path we will follow

126
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,430
<2-29,Sheldon>开发这独创程序过程中需遵照的事项
<2-29,Sheldon>as we develop our ground-breaking new app.

127
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,420
<2-30,Raj>为何我负责的是电话服务
<2-30,Raj>Hey, why am I in charge of phone support?

128
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,920
<2-30,Raj>貌似有点种族主义
<2-30,Raj>Seems a bit racist.

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,700
<2-31,Sheldon>一个操着印度口音的客服
<2-31,Sheldon>A customer service representative

130
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,060
<2-31,Sheldon>能够给客人们留下一种
<2-31,Sheldon>with an Indian accent will create the impression

131
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,760
<2-31,Sheldon>我们这是跨国公司  使用海外客服中心的印象
<2-31,Sheldon>we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centers.

132
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,870
<2-31,Sheldon>哦
<2-31,Sheldon>Oh.

133
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,910
<2-32,Raj>很聪明
<2-32,Raj>Very clever.

134
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,710
<2-32,Raj>但还是有种族色彩
<2-32,Raj>But still racist.

135
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,090
<2-33,Sheldon>提醒下  你叫史蒂夫来自威奇托[美国城市]
<2-33,Sheldon>Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.

136
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,410
<2-34,Howard>为什么我被列为你的行政助理
<2-34,Howard>Why am I listed as your executive assistant?

137
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,090
<2-35,Sheldon>因为"秘书"这个词已经变得不大光彩了
<2-35,Sheldon>Because the word "Secretary" has fallen into disrepute.

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,740
<2-35,Sheldon>提醒下  我妈妈的生日快到了
<2-35,Sheldon>FYI, my mother's birthday is coming up.

139
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,260
<2-35,Sheldon>我需要你来帮我挑选个礼物
<2-35,Sheldon>I'm going to need you to pick up a present.

140
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,010
<2-36,Leonard>好吧  我们需要暂时先停一下了
<2-36,Leonard>Okay, we need to stop for a minute.

141
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,060
<2-37,Sheldon>莱纳德  拜托  我们可以在休憩时再谈
<2-37,Sheldon>Leonard, please, we can talk during our break.

142
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,330
<2-37,Sheldon>这个午夜马上就有事情要做了
<2-37,Sheldon>We have one coming up at midnight.

143
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,210
<2-37,Sheldon>我们需要小吃
<2-37,Sheldon>We'll need snacks.

144
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,100
<2-38,Leonard>谢尔顿  这个并不是你负责的
<2-38,Leonard>Sheldon, you're not in charge.

145
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,610
<2-38,Leonard>这是我的点子  我才是负责的
<2-38,Leonard>It's my idea. I'm in charge.

146
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,750
<2-39,Sheldon>当然是你负责啊
<2-39,Sheldon>Oh, of course you are.

147
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,120
<2-39,Sheldon>快看看上面的组织机构吧
<2-39,Sheldon>Look at the organizational chart.

148
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,170
<2-39,Sheldon>你被清楚地列为了奠基人
<2-39,Sheldon>You're clearly listed as founder.

149
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,780
<2-40,Leonard>是啊  同时你被列为了首席执行官
<2-40,Leonard>Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer,

150
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,320
<2-40,Leonard>首席财务官和首席运营官
<2-40,Leonard>Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.

151
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,000
<2-41,Sheldon>你还少说了首席科技官
<2-41,Sheldon>You missed Chief Science Officer,

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,410
<2-41,Sheldon>董事局主席以及秘密圣诞委员会首脑
<2-41,Sheldon>Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.

153
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,590
<2-41,Sheldon>好了
<2-41,Sheldon>Okay.

154
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,700
<2-42,Leonard>你现在就需要搞明白这件事
<2-42,Leonard>You need to get clear on this right now.

155
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,570
<2-42,Leonard>我才是这个计划的决策人
<2-42,Leonard>I am in charge of this project.

156
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,730
<2-43,Raj>哦哦  莱纳德想取代谢尔顿成为"书呆子"界的领袖喽
<2-43,Raj>Ooh. Leonard's going all alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass...

157
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,820
<2-44,Sheldon>好吧  好吧  我不打算跟你争执下去了
<2-44,Sheldon>All right. All right, I'm not going to argue with you.

158
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,270
<2-44,Sheldon>谢尔顿·库珀如果不团队协作也一事无成
<2-44,Sheldon>Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player.

159
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,910
<2-44,Sheldon>霍夫斯塔德博士  一切由你指挥
<2-44,Sheldon>Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.

160
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,180
<2-44,Sheldon>谢谢
<2-44,Sheldon>Thank you.

161
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,620
<2-45,Leonard>我认为我们可以先从用户界面开始讨论
<2-45,Leonard>I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.

162
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,430
<2-46,Sheldon>哦天呐  我们失败定了
<2-46,Sheldon>Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.

163
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,630
<3-1,Leonard>那么这个按钮
<3-1,Leonard>So this button here

164
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,720
<3-1,Leonard>能让你扫描一个新方程
<3-1,Leonard>will allow you to scan a new equation,

165
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,400
<3-1,Leonard>而你按这边的按钮
<3-1,Leonard>but over here, you can press this,

166
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,190
<3-1,Leonard>就能替换新的系数
<3-1,Leonard>and just substitute new values for the coefficients.

167
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,920
<3-2,Sheldon>不错哎  头儿
<3-2,Sheldon>Good one, boss.

168
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,870
<3-3,Leonard>啥
<3-3,Leonard>What?

169
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,240
<3-4,Sheldon>这个图例
<3-4,Sheldon>This diagram.

170
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,790
<3-4,Sheldon>你以为您是想讲个开场笑话
<3-4,Sheldon>I assume you were opening with a joke.

171
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,310
<3-4,Sheldon>毫无疑问鼓舞了我这个小员工的团队精神
<3-4,Sheldon>It certainly buoyed up this employee's esprit de corps.

172
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,040
<3-5,Leonard>这不是玩笑  就是这么设计
<3-5,Leonard>It's not a joke. It's the real design.

173
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,010
<3-6,Sheldon>这样的话  能让我稍微修改27处
<3-6,Sheldon>In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks

174
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,310
<3-6,Sheldon>让这玩意儿看着不那么丢人吗
<3-6,Sheldon>to make it slightly less embarrassing?

175
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,410
<3-7,Leonard>谢尔顿  我觉得这个能成
<3-7,Leonard>Sheldon, I think this will work.

176
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,070
<3-7,Leonard>就按我说的做先
<3-7,Leonard>Let's just try it my way.

177
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,400
<3-7,Leonard>不好意思
<3-7,Leonard>Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

178
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,390
<3-8,Sheldon>我以为你希望你的属下
<3-8,Sheldon>I assumed that you wanted

179
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,420
<3-8,Sheldon>能畅所欲言  直言进谏
<3-8,Sheldon>candid truth-telling from your employees,

180
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,990
<3-8,Sheldon>而我现在意识到  你不过是喜欢
<3-8,Sheldon>but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering

181
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,170
<3-8,Sheldon>盲目奉承  沾沾自喜的应声虫
<3-8,Sheldon>of complacent yes-men.

182
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,080
<3-9,Leonard>说完了吗
<3-9,Leonard>Are you done?

183
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,690
<3-10,Sheldon>听你的  头儿
<3-10,Sheldon>If you say so, boss.

184
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,890
<4-1,Howard>好  按下这个键
<4-1,Howard>So right now, this button-press event

185
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,850
<4-1,Howard>就能调用一个虚拟程序...
<4-1,Howard>is just triggering a dummy procedure call...

186
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,270
<4-2,Sheldon>应用程序叫这名儿怎样
<4-2,Sheldon>How about this for the app name?

187
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,870
<4-2,Sheldon>出奇-好用-微分-方程-相关
<4-2,Sheldon>The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked

188
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,180
<4-2,Sheldon>优化-计算器
<4-2,Sheldon>Differential Optimized Numerator.

189
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,800
<4-3,Raj>首字母连起来就是"谢尔顿"
<4-3,Raj>So it spells "Sheldon."

190
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,960
<4-4,Sheldon>是吗
<4-4,Sheldon>Does it?

191
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,020
<4-4,Sheldon>好巧啊
<4-4,Sheldon>A happy accident.

192
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,940
<4-5,Leonard>现在不急着起名  霍华德  来吧
<4-5,Leonard>We're not doing names now. Howard?

193
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,340
<4-6,Howard>我也说了  现在只是个虚拟程序
<4-6,Howard>Like I was saying, right now it's just a dummy procedure,

194
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,790
<4-6,Howard>但最终会进入...
<4-6,Howard>but eventually, it will drop us into...

195
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,710
<4-7,Sheldon>好吧  如果我们先不起名
<4-7,Sheldon>All right, fine. If we're not going to give it a name,

196
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,510
<4-7,Sheldon>好歹起个秘密代号吧
<4-7,Sheldon>can we at least give it a secret code designation?

197
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,230
<4-9,Sheldon>-不要  -听我说完
<4-9,Sheldon>- No. - Hear me out.

198
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,500
<4-9,Sheldon>原子弹计划的代号是曼哈顿计划
<4-9,Sheldon>The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project.

199
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,150
<4-9,Sheldon>Win95最早的代号是芝加哥计划
<4-9,Sheldon>Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago.

200
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,620
<4-9,Sheldon>而咱的应用程序  我低调建议就叫顿尔谢计划好了
<4-9,Sheldon>For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.

201
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,130
<4-10,Leonard>不过是"谢尔顿"倒过来而已
<4-10,Leonard>That's just "Sheldon" Backwards.

202
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,490
<4-11,Sheldon>又是个愉快的巧合啊
<4-11,Sheldon>Another happy accident.

203
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,060
<4-12,Leonard>我们现在不浪费时间起名字
<4-12,Leonard>We're not wasting time with names right now.

204
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,410
<4-13,Sheldon>我懂了
<4-13,Sheldon>I see.

205
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,990
<4-13,Sheldon>能公开讨论下这个决议吗
<4-13,Sheldon>Is that decision open for discussion?

206
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,330
<4-14,Leonard>不
<4-14,Leonard>No.

207
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,460
<4-15,Sheldon>能公开讨论下为什么不公开讨论吗
<4-15,Sheldon>Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?

208
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,770
<4-16,Leonard>不
<4-16,Leonard>No.

209
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,290
<4-17,Howard>再说一遍
<4-17,Howard>Again,

210
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,630
<4-17,Howard>现在这只是个虚拟程序
<4-17,Howard>right now it's just a dummy procedure,

211
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,130
<4-17,Howard>但最终会进入...
<4-17,Howard>but eventually, it will drop us into...

212
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,680
<4-18,Sheldon>我要对现在的领导人发起不信任投票
<4-18,Sheldon>I call for a vote of no confidence

213
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,380
<4-18,Sheldon>并且要求立即更换领导人
<4-18,Sheldon>and an immediate change in leadership.

214
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,490
<4-19,Leonard>谢尔顿  快住口
<4-19,Leonard>Sheldon, stop it.

215
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,120
<4-20,Sheldon>在人类活动过程中  有必要缓解
<4-20,Sheldon>When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary

216
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,950
<4-20,Sheldon>三位有能力的科学家的合作关系
<4-20,Sheldon>to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together...

217
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,940
<4-22,Sheldon>-够了  谢尔顿  -好吧  直接开始投票吧
<4-22,Sheldon>- That's enough, Sheldon. - All right, let's get right to the vote.

218
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,580
<4-22,Sheldon>现在请所有反对莱纳德
<4-22,Sheldon>Show of hands-- all those opposed

219
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,040
<4-22,Sheldon>和他的专制帝国的人  举手
<4-22,Sheldon>to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.

220
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,950
<4-23,Leonard>够了  你被炒了
<4-23,Leonard>Okay, that's it, you're fired.

221
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,990
<4-24,Sheldon>真的吗
<4-24,Sheldon>Really?

222
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,980
<4-24,Sheldon>为什么
<4-24,Sheldon>Why?

223
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,260
<4-25,Leonard>因为你没法和人合作
<4-25,Leonard>Because you're impossible to work with.

224
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,700
<4-25,Leonard>我明白了
<4-25,Leonard>I see.

225
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,080
<4-26,Sheldon>能公开讨论下吗
<4-26,Sheldon>And is that open for discussion?

226
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,520
<5-1,Leonard>你在做什么
<5-1,Leonard>What are you doing?

227
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,590
<5-2,Sheldon>早上好  大懒虫
<5-2,Sheldon>Oh. Good morning, shoemaker.

228
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,070
<5-2,Sheldon>我想你会很高兴看到
<5-2,Sheldon>I think you'll be pleased

229
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,770
<5-2,Sheldon>昨晚精灵们的辛勤劳动成果
<5-2,Sheldon>with what the elves were up to last night.

230
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,370
<5-3,Leonard>我不是炒了你么
<5-3,Leonard>I fired you.

231
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,360
<5-4,Sheldon>我知道  我现在是个合同工
<5-4,Sheldon>Oh, I know. I'm now an independent contractor.

232
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,960
<5-5,Leonard>不  你啥都不是
<5-5,Leonard>No, you are now nothing.

233
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,330
<5-5,Leonard>你和这项目没有一毛钱关系了
<5-5,Leonard>You have no connection to this project whatsoever.

234
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,320
<5-6,Sheldon>但我做了改进
<5-6,Sheldon>But I made it better.

235
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,270
<5-7,Leonard>我不要你做改进  我要按我自己的来
<5-7,Leonard>I don't want it better. I want it my way.

236
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,410
<5-8,Sheldon>这话真是意味深长  是吧
<5-8,Sheldon>Well, that speaks volumes, doesn't it?

237
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,450
<5-8,Sheldon>好吧  我想我还是去穿公车裤吧
<5-8,Sheldon>All right, I suppose I'll go put on my bus pants.

238
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,240
<5-9,Leonard>公车裤是什么玩意
<5-9,Leonard>What the hell are bus pants?

239
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,750
<5-10,Sheldon>就是穿在普通裤子外面的裤子
<5-10,Sheldon>They are pants one wears over one's regular pants

240
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,160
<5-10,Sheldon>因为你要坐在公车上
<5-10,Sheldon>when one sits on bus seats

241
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,440
<5-10,Sheldon>别人坐过的椅子上
<5-10,Sheldon>that other people have previously sat on.

242
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,800
<5-10,Sheldon>不过也许你是企业里
<5-10,Sheldon>But perhaps from your lofty heights

243
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,930
<5-10,Sheldon>高高在上的领导  恐怕不会理解
<5-10,Sheldon>atop the corporate ladder, you've lost touch

244
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,630
<5-10,Sheldon>身为普通人的辛酸苦辣
<5-10,Sheldon>with the struggles of the common man.

245
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,160
<5-11,Leonard>听着  我还是很乐意开车送你去上班
<5-11,Leonard>Look, I'm still happy to drive you to work.

246
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,620
<5-11,Leonard>在这点上没有改变
<5-11,Leonard>Nothing's changed in that regard.

247
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,180
<5-11,Leonard>我们还是室友  还是朋友
<5-11,Leonard>We're still roommates, we're still friends.

248
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,080
<5-12,Sheldon>但你却把我  你最好的朋友
<5-12,Sheldon>Except you identified me, your best friend,

249
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,610
<5-12,Sheldon>当成一块坏死的肉
<5-12,Sheldon>as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed

250
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,010
<5-12,Sheldon>从组织上割下来再扔掉
<5-12,Sheldon>from the organism and tossed away.

251
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,910
<5-12,Sheldon>你这有严重拿破仑情结的小个子
<5-12,Sheldon>The desperate act of a little man

252
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,430
<5-12,Sheldon>还真是穷凶极恶
<5-12,Sheldon>with a big Napoleon complex.

253
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,950
<5-13,Leonard>老子告诉你
<5-13,Leonard>You know what?

254
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,970
<5-13,Leonard>速度穿你的公交裤去吧
<5-13,Leonard>Go put on your bus pants.

255
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,010
<6-1,Raj>昨天晚上  我做了个梦
<6-1,Raj>Mm. Last night, I had a dream

256
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,440
<6-1,Raj>我们因为这应用程序发了大财
<6-1,Raj>we got so rich from the app,

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,600
<6-1,Raj>我俩买了两幢相邻的别墅
<6-1,Raj>you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions.

258
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:01,950
<6-1,Raj>但是...
<6-1,Raj>But...

259
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,140
<6-1,Raj>中间有条秘密隧道
<6-1,Raj>there was a secret tunnel

260
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,750
<6-1,Raj>从你的前庭连到我的后院
<6-1,Raj>connecting your front yard to my back yard.

261
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,420
<6-1,Raj>你觉得这是啥意思
<6-1,Raj>What do you think that means?

262
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,970
<6-2,Howard>意思是我们玩完手球后  我在家洗澡
<6-2,Howard>It means after we play handball, I'm showering at home.

263
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,110
<6-3,Sheldon>早上好  霍华德好友
<6-3,Sheldon>Good morning, Friend Howard.

264
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,380
<6-3,Sheldon>拉杰好友
<6-3,Sheldon>Friend Raj.

265
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,280
<6-3,Sheldon>两位先生在喝饮料啊
<6-3,Sheldon>I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages.

266
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,100
<6-3,Sheldon>也许这些能让它们喝起来更美味
<6-3,Sheldon>Perhaps they would taste better out of these.

267
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,540
<6-4,Raj>"世上最伟大的天文物理学家"
<6-4,Raj>"World's Greatest Astrophysicist"?

268
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,350
<6-5,Sheldon>不用谢我  你应得的
<6-5,Sheldon>Don't thank me. You earned it.

269
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,260
<6-6,Howard>"霍华德·沃罗威茨"
<6-6,Howard>"Howard Wolowitz."

270
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,910
<6-6,Howard>为啥不是"世上最伟大的工程师"
<6-6,Howard>Why not "World's Greatest Engineer"?

271
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,760
<6-6,Howard>不好意思
<6-6,Howard>I'm sorry.

272
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,630
<6-7,Sheldon>我在做标签的时候是这么打过
<6-7,Sheldon>I typed that into the label maker,

273
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,880
<6-7,Sheldon>但实在按不下确认键
<6-7,Sheldon>but I just couldn't press enter.

274
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
<6-7,Sheldon>现在谈正事吧
<6-7,Sheldon>Now down to business.

275
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,050
<6-7,Sheldon>你们何不抛弃莱纳德
<6-7,Sheldon>What would it take for you to abandon Leonard

276
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,110
<6-7,Sheldon>加入竞争对手  我的公司
<6-7,Sheldon>and join me in a rival company?

277
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,180
<6-7,Sheldon>要是这两个马克杯还不够
<6-7,Sheldon>Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient,

278
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,530
<6-7,Sheldon>不管怎样  欢迎你们入伙
<6-7,Sheldon>in which case, welcome aboard.

279
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,720
<6-8,Howard>我们不会抛弃莱纳德
<6-8,Howard>We're not quitting on Leonard.

280
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,730
<6-9,Sheldon>我明白  你们的忠诚值得赞扬
<6-9,Sheldon>I understand. Your loyalty is admirable.

281
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,700
<6-9,Sheldon>但如果我再增加筹码呢
<6-9,Sheldon>But what if I were to up the ante?

282
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,820
<6-10,Raj>你在说什么鬼
<6-10,Raj>What are you talking about?

283
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,800
<6-11,Sheldon>字母组合钥匙链
<6-11,Sheldon>Monogrammed key chains

284
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,070
<6-11,Sheldon>还配有内置激光
<6-11,Sheldon>with a built-in laser pointer.

285
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,560
<6-11,Sheldon>还是不吗
<6-11,Sheldon>No?

286
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,150

<7-1,Howard>好  我们试下这个
<7-1,Howard>Okay, let's try this one.

291
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,970
<7-1,Howard>"球面汉克尔函数"
<7-1,Howard>"Spherical Hankel function."

292
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,480
<7-2,Leonard>稍等
<7-2,Leonard>Hold on.

293
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,810
<7-2,Leonard>有了
<7-2,Leonard>That's it!

294

<7-3,Howard>Eureka!

295
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,440
<7-4,Raj>喂  我们不是说好"中了"的时候
<7-4,Raj>Hey, we agreed when it was "Eureka" Time,

296
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,630
<7-4,Raj>要一起说的吗
<7-4,Raj>we were all gonna say it together.

297
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,780
<7-5,Howard>好吧  那再一起说一次好了
<7-5,Howard>Fine. Let's say it together.

298
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,850
<7-6,Raj>不了  这个时机已经过了
<7-6,Raj>No. The moment has passed.

299
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,960
<7-7,Sheldon>你们好  先生们
<7-7,Sheldon>Greetings, gentlemen.

300
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,740
<7-7,Sheldon>你们的小项目咋样了
<7-7,Sheldon>How goes your little project?

301
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,380
<7-8,Raj>你是指  "莱沃帕里"计划吗
<7-8,Raj>You mean, "Project Lenwoloppali"?

302
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,120
<7-9,Sheldon>是你们名字的组合啊
<7-9,Sheldon>Ah, a combination of all your names.

303
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,330
<2-32,Raj>真聪明
<2-32,Raj>Very clever.

304
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,660
<7-9,Sheldon>为啥不是"库萨纳德威茨"呢
<7-9,Sheldon>I assume "Koothranardowitz" Was taken?

305
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,420
<7-10,Leonard>我们在扫描方程  效果还不错
<7-10,Leonard>We're actually scanning equations and getting good results.

306
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,920
<7-11,Sheldon>好吧  你们继续努力吧
<7-11,Sheldon>Oh, well then, by all means, carry on.

307
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,930
<7-11,Sheldon>我不想妨碍你们的进程
<7-11,Sheldon>I wouldn't want to impede your progress.

308
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,380
<7-12,Leonard>霍华德  你解决了安装时间的问题了吗
<7-12,Leonard>Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?

309
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,010
<7-13,Howard>没有  这有点难应付
<7-13,Howard>No. It's a little tricky.

310
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,290
<7-13,Howard>我准备查下图书馆的查询系统...
<7-13,Howard>I'm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dyn...

311
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,420
<7-14,Leonard>你在搞什么
<7-14,Leonard>What are you doing?!

312
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,040
<7-15,Sheldon>在演奏特雷门琴
<7-15,Sheldon>Playing the theremin.

313
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,580
<7-16,Leonard>不  我是说  你拿特雷门琴在搞什么
<7-16,Leonard>No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?

314
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,030
<7-17,Sheldon>演奏啊
<7-17,Sheldon>Playing it.

315
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,270
<7-17,Sheldon>我第一次听到星际迷航原声主题乐时
<7-17,Sheldon>I've loved the theremin from the first moment

316
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,350
<7-17,Sheldon>就爱上了特雷门琴了
<7-17,Sheldon>I heard the original Star Trek theme.

317
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,680
<7-17,Sheldon>我实在是不忍心
<7-17,Sheldon>And it's been killing me

318
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,780
<7-17,Sheldon>把它一直扔在柜子里积灰
<7-17,Sheldon>that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.

319
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,600
<7-18,Leonard>谢尔顿  我们在工作
<7-18,Leonard>Sheldon! We're working here!

320
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,620
<7-18,Leonard>没关系
<7-18,Leonard>That's all right.

321
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,770
<7-19,Sheldon>我在演奏特雷门琴时几乎听不到你们说话
<7-19,Sheldon>I can barely hear you over my theremin.

322
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,660
<7-19,Sheldon>这真有点不讲道理
<7-19,Sheldon>Well, that was a little uncalled for.

323
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,000
<7-20,Leonard>不  这他妈的太讲道理了 我们需要安静
<7-20,Leonard>No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,140
<7-21,Sheldon>就是说你们的项目比我的重要咯
<7-21,Sheldon>So, your project is more important than mine?

325
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,300
<7-22,Leonard>如果你的项目就是给我捣蛋  那就是
<7-22,Leonard>Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.

326
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,960
<7-23,Sheldon>别拐弯抹角的  莱纳德
<7-23,Sheldon>Don't beat around the bush, Leonard.

327
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
<7-23,Sheldon>你要是容不下我
<7-23,Sheldon>If you don't want me here,

328
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,960
<7-23,Sheldon>说出来  我会走人的
<7-23,Sheldon>just say the word, and I'll leave.

329
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,190
<8-1,Sheldon>稍微拐弯抹角一点也没什么嘛
<8-1,Sheldon>Could have beaten around the bush a little.

330
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,830
<8-1,Sheldon>*没人知晓*
<8-1,Sheldon>Nobody knows

331
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,620
<8-1,Sheldon>*我曾经见的离乱*
<8-1,Sheldon>The trouble I've seen

332
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,720
<9-1,Sheldon (singing)>*没人理解  我的悲伤*
<9-1,Sheldon (singing)>Nobody knows my sorrow ?

333
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,720
<9-2,Penny>你干嘛呢
<9-2,Penny>What you doing?

334
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,990
<9-2,Penny>联络你的母星吗
<9-2,Penny>Trying to contact your home planet?

335
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,860
<9-3,Sheldon>我在练习特雷门琴
<9-3,Sheldon>I'm practicing my theremin.

336
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,870
<9-4,Penny>*没人知晓*
<9-4,Penny>Nobody knows

337
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,720
<9-5,Sheldon (singing)>*我曾经见的离乱*
<9-5,Sheldon (singing)>The trouble I've seen

338
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,050
<9-5,Sheldon (singing)>*荣耀啊  哈利路亚*
<9-5,Sheldon (singing)>Glory, hallelujah.

339
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,780
<9-6,Penny>什么事儿惹你不开心了吗  谢尔顿
<9-6,Penny>Something got you down, there, Sheldon?

340
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,540
<9-7,Sheldon>莱纳德把我从家轰出来了
<9-7,Sheldon>Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment.

341
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,230
<9-7,Sheldon>还有应用程序小组
<9-7,Sheldon>And his app team.

342
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,900
<9-8,Penny>亲爱的  真可怜
<9-8,Penny>Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

343
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,530
<9-9,Sheldon>他今天还不肯开车带我上班
<9-9,Sheldon>He wouldn't drive me to work today.

344
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,430
<9-9,Sheldon>搞得我不得不穿公交裤
<9-9,Sheldon>I had to wear my bus pants.

345
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,850
<9-10,Penny>-是这样吗  -嗯
<9-10,Penny>- Is that so? - Yes.

346
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,130
<9-11,Sheldon>现在裤子还粘糊糊的
<9-11,Sheldon>And they're still sticky.

347
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,410
<9-13,Sheldon>估计得扔掉了
<9-13,Sheldon>Probably going to have to throw them away.

348
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,040
<9-14,Penny>听着  你才不需要莱纳德和他的程序
<9-14,Penny>Hey, you don't need Leonard and his app.

349
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,730
<9-14,Penny>你可以跟我研究出来一个嘛
<9-14,Penny>You can make one with me.

350
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,390
<9-15,Sheldon>和你吗
<9-15,Sheldon>With you?

351
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,070
<9-16,Penny>说真的  我有个超赞的点子
<9-16,Penny>Seriously, I have a great idea for one.

352
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,470
<9-17,Sheldon>比你搬来洛杉矶
<9-17,Sheldon>Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles

353
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,350
<9-17,Sheldon>成为一个名演员的点子还赞吗
<9-17,Sheldon>and become a famous actress?

354
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,050
<9-18,Penny>行了  听着
<9-18,Penny>Okay, look...

355
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,730
<9-18,Penny>当你看到某人脚上的鞋子  让你很感冒
<9-18,Penny>when you see someone wearing shoes you like,

356
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,350
<9-18,Penny>你就拍一张照片
<9-18,Penny>you just snap a picture of them,

357
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,750
<9-18,Penny>然后用这个程序直接在网上
<9-18,Penny>and the app goes on the Internet

358
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,150
<9-18,Penny>查到哪里有卖
<9-18,Penny>to find out where you can buy them.

359
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,660
<9-19,Sheldon>这就是你应用程序的点子
<9-19,Sheldon>That's your app idea?

360
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,560
<9-20,Penny>你不感兴趣吗
<9-20,Penny>Well, you don't like it?

361
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,420
<9-21,Sheldon>我刚才没这么说  不过  我确实不感兴趣
<9-21,Sheldon>I didn't say that. But no, I don't.

362
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,170
<9-22,Penny>为什么
<9-22,Penny>Why not?

363
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,910
<9-23,Sheldon>佩妮  让我从何说起啊
<9-23,Sheldon>Oh, Penny, where do I begin?

364
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,070
<9-23,Sheldon>超越了这个点子弱智程度的
<9-23,Sheldon>The simple-mindedness of your idea

365
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,720
<9-23,Sheldon>只有愚蠢的消费者至上主义和俗不可耐
<9-23,Sheldon>is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.

366
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,510
<9-24,Penny>莱纳德不要跟你合作
<9-24,Penny>And Leonard didn't want to work with you?

367
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,200
<9-24,Penny>真"稀奇"啊
<9-24,Penny>Imagine that.

368
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,730
<9-25,Sheldon>我知道  确实匪夷所思啊
<9-25,Sheldon>I know, it's baffling.

369
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,320
<9-25,Sheldon>*没人知晓*
<9-25,Sheldon>Nobody knows

370
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,110
<9-26,Penny>*我曾经见的离乱*
<9-26,Penny>The trouble I've seen...

371
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,170
<9-26,Penny>谢尔顿  我要冲可可喝
<9-26,Penny>Sheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa.

372
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,470
<9-26,Penny>你要喝吗
<9-26,Penny>Do you want some?

373
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,630
<9-27,Sheldon>你用什么冲  牛奶还是水
<9-27,Sheldon>Do you make it with milk or water?

374
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,310
<9-29,Sheldon>-牛奶  -货真价实的可可吗
<9-29,Sheldon>- Milk. - Real cocoa?

375
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,160
<9-30,Penny>包装上是这么说的
<9-30,Penny>That's what it says on the packet.

376
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,450
<9-31,Sheldon>你有那种小棉花糖吗
<9-31,Sheldon>Do you have those little marshmallows?

377
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,320
<9-32,Penny>没有  抱歉
<9-32,Penny>No, sorry.

378
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,280
<9-33,Sheldon>看来还真是配啊
<9-33,Sheldon>Well, I suppose it's appropriate.

379
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,070
<9-34,Penny>什么意思
<9-34,Penny>What does that mean?

380
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,250
<9-35,Sheldon>倒霉日喝烂饮料
<9-35,Sheldon>A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.

381
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,760
<10-1,Raj>喂  看这个
<10-1,Raj>Hey, look at this.

382
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,730
<10-1,Raj>学校里已经有二十个人登记了
<10-1,Raj>20 people from the university have already signed up

383
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,330
<10-1,Raj>咱的内测版
<10-1,Raj>for our private beta.

384
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,610
<10-2,Leonard>我就说嘛
<10-2,Leonard>I'm telling you,

385
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,720
<10-2,Leonard>莱沃帕里微分方程扫描仪
<10-2,Leonard>the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner

386
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,420
<10-2,Leonard>满足了实际需求  咱要火了
<10-2,Leonard>meets a real need. We've got a hit.

387
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,320
<10-3,Raj>你们觉得咱该定个什么价位
<10-3,Raj>What do you think we should sell it for?

388
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,510
<10-4,Howard>这个嘛  基于我们的潜在市场
<10-4,Howard>Well, based on the fact that our potential market

389
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,510
<10-4,Howard>大约七八十人的事实
<10-4,Howard>is about 70 or 80 guys,

390
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,580
<10-4,Howard>而你又想赚个潜水艇
<10-4,Howard>and you want a submarine,

391
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,830
<10-4,Howard>我的意见是一单一百万刀
<10-4,Howard>I'd say about a million dollars a pop.

392
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,050
<10-5,Raj>不如咱出个精简版  卖五十万
<10-5,Raj>Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million?

393
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,990
<10-5,Raj>你懂吗  可以赚个口碑的说
<10-5,Raj>You know, get the word of mouth going.

394
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,800
<10-6,Penny>嗨  抱歉打扰了
<10-6,Penny>Hi. I'm sorry to bother you guys,

395
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,380
<10-6,Penny>你们得过来把你家谢尔顿领走
<10-6,Penny>but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.

396
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,630
<10-7,Leonard>他怎么会在你家
<10-7,Leonard>What's he doing in your apartment?

397
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,170
<10-8,Penny>他一人在大厅闷闷不乐  我就把他带回家了
<10-8,Penny>Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over.

398
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,350
<10-8,Penny>现在我肠子都悔青了
<10-8,Penny>Now I regret it.

399
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,080
<10-9,Leonard>他干啥让你后...废话一句  当我没说
<10-9,Leonard>Why do you regret... Uh, never mind, stupid question.

400
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,910
<10-10,Penny>就不能带他一起玩儿到睡觉吗
<10-10,Penny>Look, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime?

401
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,430
<10-11,Leonard>我们这不是玩儿
<10-11,Leonard>We're not playing.

402
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,670
<10-11,Leonard>这是正事
<10-11,Leonard>This is real work.

403
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,590
<10-12,Howard>我们就要成为百-富翁咯
<10-12,Howard>We're going to be hundred-aires.

404
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,700
<10-13,Penny>成吧  要是我能让他道歉并且保证他乖呢
<10-13,Penny>Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?

405
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,680
<10-14,Leonard>这样的话  我们的研究组可以接受他
<10-14,Leonard>Then I guess we would let him back on the app team,

406
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,090
<10-14,Leonard>他回来之后  你说不定能坐着你的飞天猪仔
<10-14,Leonard>and while we're doing that, you could take an aerial tour

407
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,790
<10-14,Leonard>在空中游览洛城
<10-14,Leonard>of L.A. on your flying pig.

408
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,340
<10-15,Penny>好吧  等着啊
<10-15,Penny>Okay. Wait right here.

409
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,510
<10-16,Raj>跟你们说吧  要是我有天发达了
<10-16,Raj>I'll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough,

410
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,580
<10-16,Raj>我就想带这样的女孩
<10-16,Raj>that's the kind of girl I want to take

411
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,520
<10-16,Raj>来一次潜水艇之旅
<10-16,Raj>on a submarine ride.

412
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,370
<10-16,Raj>而且没错  我是要龌龊一下
<10-16,Raj>And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.

413
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,440
<10-16,Raj>真的吗
<10-16,Raj>Really?

414
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,910
<11-1,Sheldon>莱纳德想让我回去吗
<11-1,Sheldon>Leonard wants me back?

415
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,560
<11-2,Penny>没错  他说你不在他们就群龙无首了
<11-2,Penny>Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.

416
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,510
<11-3,Sheldon>这还用说
<11-3,Sheldon>Well, we sure saw that coming.

417
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,140
<11-4,Penny>那是
<11-4,Penny>That's right.

418
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,500
<11-5,Sheldon>你知道我准备干吗吗
<11-5,Sheldon>You know what I'm going to do?

419
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,610
<11-5,Sheldon>我准备就一直坐在这  由得他们去烦吧
<11-5,Sheldon>I am going to sit here and just let them stew.

420
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,930
<11-6,Penny>别  别  别
<11-6,Penny>No, no, no. You know,

421
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,370
<11-6,Penny>他们已经够受罪的了
<11-6,Penny>they have suffered enough.

422
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,220
<11-6,Penny>大家都够受罪的了
<11-6,Penny>Everybody's suffered enough.

423
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,010
<11-6,Penny>关键是  你得过去
<11-6,Penny>The thing is, you're going to have to offer him

424
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,760
<11-6,Penny>给他一个有面子的台阶下
<11-6,Penny>a face-saving way out of this.

425
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,710
<11-7,Sheldon>怎么给他台阶下
<11-7,Sheldon>How?

426
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,800
<11-8,Penny>道个歉呗
<11-8,Penny>Say you're sorry.

427
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
<11-9,Sheldon>不
<11-9,Sheldon>Oh, no.

428
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,290
<11-9,Sheldon>我亲爱的母亲玛丽·库珀太太可没教我撒谎
<11-9,Sheldon>Mrs. Mary Cooper didn't raise her no liars.

429
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,080
<11-10,Penny>好吧
<11-10,Penny>Okay. Um...

430
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,610
<11-10,Penny>那这样好不好  你不是一直想要学
<11-10,Penny>How about this? You know how you're always trying

431
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,150
<11-10,Penny>挖苦人吗
<11-10,Penny>to learn about sarcasm?

432
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,860
<11-12,Penny>-没有  -没有吗
<11-12,Penny>- No.  - No?

433
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,820
<11-13,Sheldon>我刚刚那就是挖苦
<11-13,Sheldon>I was being sarcastic.

434
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,370
<11-14,Penny>真不错
<11-14,Penny>Oh. Good for you.

435
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,760
<11-14,Penny>所以你只需要过去
<11-14,Penny>So all you have to do here is say

436
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,910
<11-14,Penny>跟莱纳德道歉
<11-14,Penny>you're sorry to Leonard,

437
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,140
<11-14,Penny>但是语气要带着挖苦
<11-14,Penny>but say it sarcastically.

438
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,860
<11-14,Penny>当然
<11-14,Penny>Of course.

439
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,910
<11-15,Sheldon>在他听来  那是我在示好
<11-15,Sheldon>He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences,

440
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,040
<11-15,Sheldon>但实际上咱俩清楚
<11-15,Sheldon>as opposed to the withering condemnation

441
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,170
<11-15,Sheldon>那是赤裸裸的谴责
<11-15,Sheldon>you and I will know it to be.

442
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,390
<11-16,Penny>没错  没错  我就这个意思
<11-16,Penny>Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan.

443
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,600
<11-16,Penny>好了  走吧  咱们过去
<11-16,Penny>All right. Come on. Let's go.

444
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,390
<11-17,Sheldon>顺便说一句  谢谢你
<11-17,Sheldon>Oh, by the way, thank you

445
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,110
<11-17,Sheldon>做了这么好喝的可可
<11-17,Sheldon>for the delicious cocoa.

446
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,760
<11-18,Penny>不客气
<11-18,Penny>Oh, you're welcome.

447
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,990
<11-19,Sheldon>我的挖苦功夫真是越来越精湛了
<11-19,Sheldon>Boy, I'm getting good at this.

448
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,300
<12-1,Leonard>好吧  既然你归队了
<12-1,Leonard>Okay, now that you're back on the team,

449
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,700
<12-1,Leonard>那我们就给你介绍一下最新进展吧
<12-1,Leonard>let's get you caught up.

450
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,950
<12-2,Sheldon>在你开始之前  我想再次
<12-2,Sheldon>Before you begin, let me say again

451
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,250
<12-2,Sheldon>为我之前的表现向你表示深刻的道歉
<12-2,Sheldon>how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behavior

452
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,640
<12-2,Sheldon>另外我很尊重并且钦佩你的领导
<12-2,Sheldon>and how much I respect and admire your leadership.

453
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,650
<12-2,Sheldon>谢谢
<12-2,Sheldon>Thank you.

454
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,590
<12-3,Leonard>所以正如你所见
<12-3,Leonard>So as you can see,

455
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,380
<12-3,Leonard>你现在不仅可以储存你最喜欢的公式
<12-3,Leonard>not only can you store your favorite equations,

456
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,660
<12-3,Leonard>还能把他们转发给你的朋友们
<12-3,Leonard>but you can forward them to your friends

457
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,270
<12-3,Leonard>或是直接通过应用程序把他们贴到Facebook上
<12-3,Leonard>or post them on Facebook right from the app.

458
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,470
<12-4,Sheldon>我真得说  这太厉害了
<12-4,Sheldon>Well, I must say, I am impressed.

459
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,150
<12-5,Leonard>谢谢
<12-5,Leonard>Thanks.

460
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,670
<12-6,Sheldon>你们显然为此花了不少心血
<12-6,Sheldon>You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.

461
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,550
<12-7,Howard>的确如此
<12-7,Howard>We have.

462
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,460
<12-8,Sheldon>正因为这样  你们掌握了
<12-8,Sheldon>As a result, you have taken

463
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,100
<12-8,Sheldon>通往成功之路的最重要的一步
<12-8,Sheldon>the most important step on the road to success:

464
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,480
<12-8,Sheldon>在失败中学习
<12-8,Sheldon>learning what not to do.

465
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,280
<12-8,Sheldon>现在让我们重新开始吧
<12-8,Sheldon>Now, let's start fresh.

466
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,390
<12-8,Sheldon>霍华德  给我们弄点茶喝
<12-8,Sheldon>Howard, we're going to need some tea.

467
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,010
<13-1,Penny>好的  这双是雪地靴
<13-1,Penny>Okay, these are Uggs.

468
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,820
<13-1,Penny>这双是卡骆驰
<13-1,Penny>These are Crocs.

469
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,800
<13-1,Penny>这双是山寨版的马诺洛·布兰尼克
<13-1,Penny>These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.

470
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,310
<13-2,Sheldon>无聊
<13-2,Sheldon>Bored.

471
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,170
<13-3,Penny>这可是你自己说的  我们要先建立一个数据库
<13-3,Penny>Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database
