1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,520
<1-1,Sheldon>你觉得如何
<1-1,Sheldon>So what'd you think?

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,980
<1-2,Amy>还不错
<1-2,Amy>It was good.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,260
<1-2,Amy>就这样吗
<1-2,Amy>That's it?

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,890
<1-2,Amy>"还不错"
<1-2,Amy>"Good"?

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,430
<1-3,Sheldon>我看得挺开心啊
<1-3,Sheldon>I enjoyed it.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,820
<1-4,Amy>你说要让我"体验第一次"的时候
<1-4,Amy>When you told me I was going to be "losing my virginity,"

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,980
<1-4,Amy>我没有想到你是指
<1-4,Amy>I didn't think you meant showing me

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,990
<1-4,Amy>"第一次"看《夺宝奇兵》啊
<1-4,Amy>Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,350
<1-5,Sheldon>我的错  我用词太不准确了
<1-5,Sheldon>My apologies. I chose my words poorly.

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,840
<1-5,Sheldon>我应该说  "你将会
<1-5,Sheldon>I should have said you were about

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,120
<1-5,Sheldon>在我沙发上爽入云霄"
<1-5,Sheldon>to have your world rocked on my couch.

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,930
<1-5,Sheldon>总之  谢谢你陪我看完
<1-5,Sheldon>Anyway, thank you for watching it.

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,060
<1-5,Sheldon>这是我最爱的电影之一
<1-5,Sheldon>It's one of my all-time favorites.

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,700
<1-6,Amy>这电影娱乐性非常高
<1-6,Amy>It was very entertaining...

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,900
<1-6,Amy>可惜情节漏洞百出
<1-6,Amy>despite the glaring story problem.

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,180
<1-6,Amy>情节漏洞百出
<1-6,Amy>Story problem?!

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,330
<1-7,Sheldon>你...  艾米
<1-7,Sheldon>You-- oh, Amy...

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,610
<1-7,Sheldon>你真是好傻好天真啊
<1-7,Sheldon>What a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are.

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,350
<1-7,Sheldon>《夺宝奇兵》这电影
<1-7,Sheldon>Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,490
<1-7,Sheldon>是斯蒂芬·斯皮尔伯格与乔治·卢卡斯
<1-7,Sheldon>of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas,

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,200
<1-7,Sheldon>这两位当代最有才制片人的心血结晶
<1-7,Sheldon>two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation.

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,670
<1-7,Sheldon>我看了足足有36遍
<1-7,Sheldon>I've watched it 36 times,

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,010
<1-7,Sheldon>除了满是蛇与脸融化的那两幕
<1-7,Sheldon>except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene,

25
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,440
<1-7,Sheldon>只有天还亮的时候我才敢看  但...
<1-7,Sheldon>which I can only watch when it's still light out, but...

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,740
<1-7,Sheldon>有本事你说出个情节漏洞我听听
<1-7,Sheldon>I defy you to find a story problem.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,020
<1-7,Sheldon>让我的下巴
<1-7,Sheldon>Here's my jaw...

28
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,790
<1-7,Sheldon>吓掉吧
<1-7,Sheldon>drop it.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,210
<1-7,Sheldon>行啊
<1-7,Sheldon>All right.

30
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,410
<1-8,Amy>主角印第安纳·琼斯的存在
<1-8,Amy>Indiana Jones plays no role

31
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,070
<1-8,Amy>对电影的结局没有任何影响
<1-8,Amy>in the outcome of the story.

32
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,560
<1-8,Amy>就算把他从故事里删掉
<1-8,Amy>If he weren't in the film,

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,200
<1-8,Amy>电影结局也不会有任何差别
<1-8,Amy>it would turn out exactly the same.

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,370
<1-9,Sheldon>我知道你问题在哪了  你没搞清楚
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, I see your confusion. You don't understand.

35
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,760
<1-9,Sheldon>戴帽子拿鞭子那男的才是印第安纳·琼斯
<1-9,Sheldon>Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.

36
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,880
<1-9,Sheldon>我当然知道
<1-9,Sheldon>No, I do,

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,380
<1-10,Amy>就算电影里没他
<1-10,Amy>and if he weren't in the movie,

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,300
<1-10,Amy>纳粹还是会找到法柜
<1-10,Amy>the Nazis would have still found the ark,

39
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,490
<1-10,Amy>送上孤岛  打开法柜  然后死光光
<1-10,Amy>taken it to the island, opened it up and all died...

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,810
<1-10,Amy>跟有他的版本一样
<1-10,Amy>just like they did.

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,140
<1-10,Amy>我替你把下巴合上吧
<1-10,Amy>Let me close that for ya.

<2-2,Penny>I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,270
<2-3,Leonard>但谢尔顿跟艾米今晚是约会之夜
<2-3,Leonard>Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night

53
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,270
<2-3,Leonard>他们不需要我来把场面弄尴尬
<2-3,Leonard>and they don't need me there to make it awkward.

54
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,820
<2-3,Leonard>他们靠彼此就够尴尬了
<2-3,Leonard>They have each other for that.

55
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,300
<2-3,Leonard>最近课上得怎么样
<2-3,Leonard>So, how was school?

<2-6,Penny>It's on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.

60
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,740
<2-7,Leonard>不是吧  选其他本书啊
<2-7,Leonard>Come on. Not that book.

61

<2-7,Leonard>里面详细记录了我从小到大
<2-7,Leonard>It-It's got, like, every horrible story

62
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,430
<2-7,Leonard>每一段丢人事

<2-8,Penny>Oh, cool. Are there pictures?

<2-9,Leonard>求你了  换一本书吧
<2-9,Leonard>Seriously, please find another book.

65
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,700
<2-10,Penny>拜托  能把你写得多糟糕啊
<2-10,Penny>Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?

66
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,760
<2-11,Leonard>里面有章节是写训练我如厕
<2-11,Leonard>There-There's chapters about potty training,

67
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
<2-11,Leonard>写尿床
<2-11,Leonard>and bed-wetting and...

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,420
<2-11,Leonard>以及自慰
<2-11,Leonard>masturbation.

69
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,280
<2-11,Leonard>基本上  有东西从我体内出来
<2-11,Leonard>Basically, if something came out of me,

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,480
<2-11,Leonard>她都有写下来
<2-11,Leonard>she wrote about it!

71
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,520
<2-11,Leonard>这样吧  你想看就看
<2-11,Leonard>You know what? Do whatever you want,

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,300
<2-11,Leonard>但看完别来跟我谈论
<2-11,Leonard>just don't talk to me about it.

73
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,790
<2-12,Penny>连"喂奶危机"那一段都不能聊吗
<2-12,Penny>Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?

74
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,400
<2-13,Leonard>才不是什么危机咧
<2-13,Leonard>It was not a crisis.

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,510
<2-13,Leonard>也就是我比较喜欢吸左奶
<2-13,Leonard>Apparently, I favored the left one,

76
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,970
<2-13,Leonard>害她左右不平衡罢了
<2-13,Leonard>she got a little lopsided.

77
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,480
<2-14,Penny>天啊  你现在还是挑左边呢
<2-14,Penny>Oh, my God, you still go left!

78
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,420
<3-1,Raj>你觉得我看起来最像哪个明星
<3-1,Raj>Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?

79
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,630
<3-2,Howard>哈莉·贝瑞
<3-2,Howard>Halle Berry.

81
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,370
<3-2,Howard>问这干嘛
<3-2,Howard>Why?

82
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,430
<3-3,Raj>我跟斯图尔特要填征友网站的资料
<3-3,Raj>Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online,

83
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,280
<3-3,Raj>这是其中一道题
<3-3,Raj>and it's one of the questions.

84
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,390
<3-3,Raj>不过谢谢夸奖  她的身材骨架棒呆了
<3-3,Raj>And thank you-- I'd kill for that woman's bone structure.

85
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,060
<3-4,Leonard>你为什么在读《傲慢与偏见》啊
<3-4,Leonard>Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?

86
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,380
<3-5,Sheldon>我告诉你为什么
<3-5,Sheldon>I'll tell you why.

87
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,070
<3-5,Sheldon>艾米把我对《夺宝奇兵》的爱给毁了
<3-5,Sheldon>Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me,

88
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,190
<3-5,Sheldon>所以我现在也要找出
<3-5,Sheldon>so now I'm trying to find

89
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,260
<3-5,Sheldon>她钟爱的事物来毁掉它
<3-5,Sheldon>something beloved to her and ruin that.

90
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,310
<3-6,Howard>她这一生还被毁得不够多吗
<3-6,Howard>Because her life wasn't enough?

91
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,960
<3-6,Howard>等等
<3-6,Howard>Wait...

92
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,160
<3-7,Raj>《夺宝奇兵》怎么可能会有瑕疵呢
<3-7,Raj>how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders?

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,030
<3-7,Raj>这可是完美杰作
<3-7,Raj>It's perfect.

94
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,100
<3-8,Sheldon>除了主角对于故事剧情发展
<3-8,Sheldon>Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones

95
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,320
<3-8,Sheldon>没有任何存在的必要  无论电影有他没他
<3-8,Sheldon>is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him,

96
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
<3-8,Sheldon>纳粹还是会找到法柜  打开  然后死光
<3-8,Sheldon>the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.

97
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,510
<3-10,Howard>等等
<3-10,Howard>Hey, wait a minute.

98
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,420
<3-10,Howard>不对啊  纳粹本来挖错了地点
<3-10,Howard>No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place.

99
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,470
<3-10,Howard>他们之所以能找到法柜
<3-10,Howard>The only reason they got the ark

100
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,130
<3-10,Howard>全因主角先找到它
<3-10,Howard>was because Indy found it first.

101
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,000
<3-11,Leonard>纳粹之所以会挖错地方
<3-11,Leonard>Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,320
<3-11,Leonard>全因"拉雅之杆"元件在主角手里
<3-11,Leonard>because Indy had the medallion.

104
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,740
<3-11,Leonard>没有主角  元件会落在纳粹手中
<3-11,Leonard>Without him, they would have had the medallion

105
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,580
<3-11,Leonard>他们直接就到正确地点挖宝了
<3-11,Leonard>and dug in the right place.

106
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,230
<4-1,Penny>我知道你不想谈书中内容
<4-1,Penny>Okay, I know you don't want to talk about it,

107
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,080
<4-1,Penny>但我真有一个问题想问你
<4-1,Penny>but can I just ask you one question about your mom's book?

108
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,620
<4-2,Leonard>不行
<4-2,Leonard>No.

109
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,560
<4-3,Penny>我就想知道
<4-3,Penny>I just want to know

110
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,730
<4-3,Penny>为什么五岁男孩会拿妈的化妆品化妆
<4-3,Penny>why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom's makeup

111
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,200
<4-3,Penny>然后用气球当咪咪
<4-3,Penny>and wears balloon boobies.

112
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,270
<4-4,Leonard>那些不是咪咪  是胸肌
<4-4,Leonard>They weren't boobies, they were muscles.

113
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,530
<4-4,Leonard>化妆是画绿妆
<4-4,Leonard>And the makeup was green.

114
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,680
<4-4,Leonard>我想把自己画成绿巨人浩克
<4-4,Leonard>I was pretending to be The Hulk.

115
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,620
<4-5,Penny>但你戴着她胸罩
<4-5,Penny>You were wearing her bra.

116
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,890
<4-6,Leonard>那是为了让我的"胸肌"不下垂
<4-6,Leonard>That was to keep my muscles from sagging!

117
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,350
<4-6,Leonard>我们可以不谈这话题了吗
<4-6,Leonard>Can we please stop talking about this?!

118
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,420
<4-6,Leonard>好啦  好啦
<4-6,Leonard>Okay, okay.

119
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,150
<4-7,Penny>但作为一个心理学的学生
<4-7,Penny>But you know, as a student of psychology

120
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,660
<4-7,Penny>还是作业得到了√+评价的学生
<4-7,Penny>who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment...

121
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
<4-7,Penny>有时候  说出童年阴影
<4-7,Penny>I think, sometimes, it's good to

122
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,710
<4-7,Penny>也是挺不错的啊
<4-7,Penny>open up about these things.

123
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,710
<4-8,Leonard>好吧  行
<4-8,Leonard>Okay, fine.

124
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,720
<4-8,Leonard>你想知道为什么我打扮成绿巨人吗
<4-8,Leonard>Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk?

125
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,230
<4-8,Leonard>因为我总是很气我妈
<4-8,Leonard>Because I was always mad at my mom

126
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,090
<4-8,Leonard>我想要一拳砸烂我家  然后逃走
<4-8,Leonard>and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.

127
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,740
<4-9,Penny>你心里为什么这么多怨气呢
<4-9,Penny>Well, why were you so angry?

128
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,080
<4-10,Leonard>我也不知道
<4-10,Leonard>Gee, I don't know.

129
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,320
<4-10,Leonard>或许因为我总是她的实验品
<4-10,Leonard>Maybe it's because I was always the subject of her little experiments.

130
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,100
<4-10,Leonard>你有看到"寻找复活节彩蛋"那章吗
<4-10,Leonard>Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt

131
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,030
<4-10,Leonard>根本就没有彩蛋  她故意试试我能找多久
<4-10,Leonard>with no eggs to see how long I'd keep looking?

132
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,690
<4-10,Leonard>对了  答案是
<4-10,Leonard>The answer, by the way:

134
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,640
<4-10,Leonard>我找到六月份
<4-10,Leonard>June.

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
<4-11,Penny>亲爱的  真的很对不起
<4-11,Penny>Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,280
<4-11,Penny>真希望我能做些什么  让你好过一点
<4-11,Penny>I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.

137
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,010
<4-12,Leonard>我也希望  但是你不能
<4-12,Leonard>I do, too, but there's not.

138
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,770
<4-13,Penny>真的吗  你确定吗
<4-13,Penny>Really? Are you sure about that?

139
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,020
<4-14,Leonard>当然  我怎么能质疑√+学生呢
<4-14,Leonard>Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student?

140
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,190
<4-14,Leonard>先警告你啊  这次我挑右胸
<4-14,Leonard>Just warning you-- I'm gonna go right.

141
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,650
<4-14,Leonard>别小题大做问我为什么
<4-14,Leonard>Don't make a big deal out of it.

142
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,780
<5-1,Stuart>真的有必要化妆吗
<5-1,Stuart>Is makeup really necessary?

143
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,500
<5-2,Raj>一般人们看你的征友信息
<5-2,Raj>Well, when someone looks at your dating profile,

144
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,470
<5-2,Raj>第一眼肯定是先看你的照片啊
<5-2,Raj>the first thing they see is your picture.

145
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,230
<5-2,Raj>我只是想让你看起来不那么无趣
<5-2,Raj>I just want to make sure you look fun

146
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,490
<5-2,Raj>充满生气  而不是像一具刚从河里
<5-2,Raj>and full of life and not like a body

147
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,510
<5-2,Raj>捞出来的尸体那样死气沉沉
<5-2,Raj>they just pulled out of the river.

148
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,600
<5-2,Raj>好了  开始吧
<5-2,Raj>All right, here we go, and...

149
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,780
<5-2,Raj>笑一个
<5-2,Raj>smile.

150
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,630
<5-2,Raj>好吧  刚才那张不算
<5-2,Raj>Okay, uh-uh, that one's in the bank.

151
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,880
<5-2,Raj>不如这样
<5-2,Raj>How about this?

152
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,890
<5-2,Raj>你先把头转过去  然后再转回来
<5-2,Raj>Turn away, and then turn back into it.

153
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,910
<5-2,Raj>当你回头时
<5-2,Raj>But when you do,

154
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,580
<5-4,Raj>把相机想象成你想见到的女生
<5-4,Raj>imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.

155
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,350
<5-4,Raj>没问题
<5-4,Raj>You got it.

156
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,910
<5-4,Raj>好吧
<5-4,Raj>Okay, uh,

157
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,980
<5-4,Raj>再来一遍
<5-4,Raj>let's try it again.

158
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,240
<5-4,Raj>但这一次  你要把相机当成是你想见到
<5-4,Raj>Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet

159
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,340
<5-4,Raj>而且不会揍你的女生
<5-4,Raj>doesn't want to hurt you.

160
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,430
<5-5,Stuart>这个恐怕有点难度
<5-5,Stuart>I don't think I can give you that.

161
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,390
<5-6,Raj>拜托  再试一次
<5-6,Raj>Come on. One more time.

162
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,440
<5-6,Raj>好吧  这张有点模糊
<5-6,Raj>Yeah, it's, it's a little blurry,

163
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,160
<5-6,Raj>不过这应该对你有益无害
<5-6,Raj>but I think that works in your favor.

164
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,590
<5-6,Raj>-想喝啤酒吗  -好啊
<5-6,Raj>- Do you want a beer? - Sure.

165
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,040
<5-7,Stuart>你的征友信息写完了吗
<5-7,Stuart>Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?

166
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,260
<5-8,Raj>差不多了
<5-8,Raj>Almost.

167
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,470
<5-8,Raj>"用一个词形容自己"
<5-8,Raj>Oh, what did you put

168
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,780
<5-8,Raj>你用的是哪个词
<5-8,Raj>as the one-word description of yourself?

169
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,630
<5-9,Stuart>我用了"不讨人厌"
<5-9,Stuart>I put unobjectionable.

170
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,870
<5-9,Stuart>但是当我亲耳听到这个词时
<5-9,Stuart>But now that I hear it out loud,

171
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,840
<5-9,Stuart>感觉好像有点过于自信了
<5-9,Stuart>it just seems like I'm being cocky.

172
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,900
<5-10,Raj>那你优点你写了什么
<5-10,Raj>What did you put for your best feature?

173
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,470
<5-10,Raj>我的父母是土豪
<5-10,Raj>My parents' money.

174
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,850
<5-10,Raj>那你的优点你写什么
<5-10,Raj>Uh, what did you put for your best feature?

175
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,620
<5-11,Stuart>我写了"无"
<5-11,Stuart>I put not applicable.

176
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,340
<5-12,Raj>拜托  伙计  你对自己太严苛了
<5-12,Raj>Come on, dude, you're being too hard on yourself.

177
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,020
<5-12,Raj>你具备很多优秀的条件啊
<5-12,Raj>You've got a lot of good stuff going on.

178
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,350
<5-13,Stuart>真的吗  比如说
<5-13,Stuart>Really? Like what?

179
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,320
<5-14,Raj>你是一个有天赋的艺术家
<5-14,Raj>Well, okay, you're a, you're a talented artist,

180
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,210
<5-14,Raj>你有自己的事业
<5-14,Raj>you own your own business.

181
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,380
<5-15,Stuart>但这两者未曾对我泡妞有过帮助
<5-15,Stuart>Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.

182
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,460
<5-16,Raj>好吧  那我们能暗示
<5-16,Raj>Okay, well, can we imply

183
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,130
<5-16,Raj>你"那方面"天赋异禀吗
<5-16,Raj>that you're well-endowed?

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,510
<5-17,Stuart>我的确是有个特别长的...  睾丸
<5-17,Stuart>I do have one oddly long testicle.

185
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,150
<5-18,Raj>现在像个有自信的男人在说话了
<5-18,Raj>Okay, now you're talking like a winner!

186
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,260
<6-1,Leonard>你在干什么
<6-1,Leonard>Whatcha doin'?

187
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,300
<6-2,Sheldon>我发现艾米喜欢的《傲慢与偏见》
<6-2,Sheldon>Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved Pride and Prejudice

188
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,870
<6-2,Sheldon>是一部毫无瑕疵的杰作
<6-2,Sheldon>is a flawless masterpiece.

189
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,870
<6-2,Sheldon>男主角的确很傲慢
<6-2,Sheldon>He's got too much pride,

190
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,240
<6-2,Sheldon>女主角的确很多偏见
<6-2,Sheldon>she's got too much prejudice--

191
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,410
<6-2,Sheldon>毫无破绽可言
<6-2,Sheldon>it just works.

192
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,170
<6-3,Leonard>所以你为了要毁掉她喜欢的东西
<6-3,Leonard>So you're looking to ruin something for her

193
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,600
<6-3,Leonard>你都开始看漫画了吗
<6-3,Leonard>in the funny pages?

194
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,430
<6-4,Sheldon>艾米喜欢看《大丹麦狗马默杜克》的连载漫画
<6-4,Sheldon>Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.

195
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,430
<6-4,Sheldon>《大丹麦狗马默杜克》是美国家喻户晓的一个动画人物
<6-4,Sheldon>故事的主角是一只顽皮的巨型犬大丹麦狗

196
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,460
<6-5,Leonard>然后呢
<6-5,Leonard>And...?

197
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,340
<6-6,Sheldon>我觉得我找到了
<6-6,Sheldon>And I think I've got it.

198
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,300
<6-6,Sheldon>想一下
<6-6,Sheldon>Consider:

199
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,270
<6-6,Sheldon>一个家庭里有一只这么大
<6-6,Sheldon>a family possesses a dog that is so large

200
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,580
<6-6,Sheldon>而且丝毫不守规矩
<6-6,Sheldon>and poorly disciplined,

201
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,020
<6-6,Sheldon>除了惹麻烦就什么都不会的巨型犬
<6-6,Sheldon>he causes nothing but problems.

202
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,740
<6-6,Sheldon>他们为什么还要养它呢
<6-6,Sheldon>Why do they keep him?!

203
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,030
<6-7,Leonard>或许是因为他们爱上它的时候  它还只是小狗
<6-7,Leonard>Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy

204
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,060
<6-7,Leonard>那家人也没想到它能长这么大
<6-7,Leonard>and didn't know how big he was gonna be.

205
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,160
<6-7,Leonard>有道理
<6-7,Leonard>Of course.

206
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,760
<6-8,Sheldon>为什么她不喜欢《奇奇》
<6-8,Sheldon>You know, why couldn't she just like Ziggy?

208
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,670
<6-8,Sheldon>真是的
<6-8,Sheldon>Yeah?

209
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,300
<6-8,Sheldon>那部漫画情节漏洞百出
<6-8,Sheldon>That thing's riddled with plot holes.

210
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,510
<6-9,Leonard>真是可惜啊  伙计
<6-9,Leonard>Sorry, buddy.

211
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,370
<6-10,Sheldon>我觉得她也喜欢《加菲猫》
<6-10,Sheldon>I think she's a fan of Garfield as well.

212
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,200
<6-10,Sheldon>靠  现在我也是加菲迷了
<6-10,Sheldon>Oh, darn it, now so am I.

213
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,100
<6-11,Leonard>晚点见
<6-11,Leonard>I'll see you later.

214
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,490
<6-11,Leonard>我得陪佩妮去看一场白痴的球赛
<6-11,Leonard>I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.

215
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,890
<6-12,Sheldon>慢着  先别走
<6-12,Sheldon>Wait-- hang on.

216
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,490
<6-12,Sheldon>你跟艾米一起待过
<6-12,Sheldon>You've spent time with Amy.

217
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,820
<6-12,Sheldon>你能想到什么她喜欢的东西
<6-12,Sheldon>Can you think of anything she's fond of

218
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,130
<6-12,Sheldon>然后还有很多她没有注意到的瑕疵吗
<6-12,Sheldon>that has a bunch of flaws she hasn't noticed?

219
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,060
<6-13,Leonard>我真得走了
<6-13,Leonard>I gotta go.

220
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,610
<7-1,Leonard>-准备好了吗  -好了
<7-1,Leonard>- You ready to go? - Yep.

221
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,700
<7-2,Penny>对了  或许这次
<7-2,Penny>Hey, and maybe this time

222
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,790
<7-2,Penny>你别再跟那些男生讨论体育了
<7-2,Penny>you don't try and talk sports with the guys.

223
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,630
<7-3,Leonard>什么破体育酒吧
<7-3,Leonard>Some sports bar.

224
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,150
<7-3,Leonard>他们居然从来没听说过魁地奇球赛
<7-3,Leonard>It's like they never even heard of Quidditch.

226
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,970
<7-3,Leonard>我们真的得去吗
<7-3,Leonard>Do we really have to go?

227
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,120
<7-4,Penny>别这样嘛  每次我们
<7-4,Penny>Oh, come on. Every time we're about

228
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,850
<7-4,Penny>要去跟我的朋友玩  你都不想去
<7-4,Penny>to hang out with my friends, you don't want to.

229
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,110
<7-4,Penny>每次都说"太吵了"
<7-4,Penny>It's like, "It's too loud,"

230
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,640
<7-4,Penny>"厕所太脏了"
<7-4,Penny>or "the bathroom's too dirty,"

231
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,710
<7-4,Penny>"他们拿鸡翅插我耳朵"
<7-4,Penny>or "they put a chicken wing in my ear..." I mean...

232
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,600
<7-5,Leonard>你说得对
<7-5,Leonard>Well, you're-you're right.

233
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,560
<7-5,Leonard>我们走吧
<7-5,Leonard>Let's just go.

234
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,820
<7-6,Penny>你到底怎么了
<7-6,Penny>Hey, what's going on with you?

235
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,550
<7-7,Leonard>没事  我很好啊
<7-7,Leonard>Nothing, I'm fine.

236
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,600
<7-8,Penny>好吧  先别走
<7-8,Penny>All right, hang on.

237
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,230
<7-8,Penny>是不是还是因为你妈妈的书
<7-8,Penny>is this still about your mom's book?

238
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,610
<7-9,Leonard>不是  不是所有事情都跟我妈有关
<7-9,Leonard>No. Not everything is about my mom.

239
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,830
<7-10,Penny>如果你还在为此而不开心
<7-10,Penny>'Cause if you're still upset about that,

240
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,860
<7-10,Penny>我们可以不用去的
<7-10,Penny>we don't have to go.

241
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,870
<7-11,Leonard>不过这次真的是因为我妈
<7-11,Leonard>Except this is totally about my mom.

242
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,300
<7-11,Leonard>真的很对不起
<7-11,Leonard>I'm so sorry.

243
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,580
<7-12,Penny>我真不应该看那本书的
<7-12,Penny>I never should have read that book.

244
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,020
<7-12,Penny>那你想去吃个晚餐
<7-12,Penny>You know what? You want to just get dinner

245
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,930
<7-12,Penny>然后回来这里看比赛吗
<7-12,Penny>and watch the game here?

246
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,040
<7-13,Leonard>-这主意不错  -好
<7-13,Leonard>- That sounds nice. - Okay.

247
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,800
<7-15,Leonard>或者我们也可以买外卖
<7-15,Leonard>Or, you know, we could get take-out

248
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,220
<7-15,Leonard>然后在这里看蓝光加长附带
<7-15,Leonard>and watch the Blu-ray extended version

249
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,110
<7-15,Leonard>导演评论音轨版的《霍比特人》电影啊
<7-15,Leonard>of The Hobbit movie with commentary track.

250
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,180
<7-15,Leonard>因为我被我妈这件事弄得太难过了嘛
<7-15,Leonard>On account of how sad I am about my mom.

251
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,270
<8-1,Howard>莱纳德  准备好吃饭了吗

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,400
<8-14,Leonard>能不能撑到最后
<8-14,Leonard>if she'd make it to the end.

273
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,980
<8-15,Howard>你听起来蛮引以为傲的嘛
<8-15,Howard>You sound kind of proud of it.

280
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,840
<9-3,Amy>是因为你的薯条里有一根卷薯条
<9-3,Amy>there was a curly fry in your regular fries

281
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,980
<9-3,Amy>你当时怀疑有人想对你下迷药

359
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,570
<11-7,Raj>感觉有点怪怪的
<11-7,Raj>You know, it... it's weird.

360
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,250
<11-7,Raj>当她们在阅读你的个人资料时
<11-7,Raj>When they're reading your profile, does it...

361
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,090
<11-7,Raj>你有没有感觉像摊开被人检阅一样
<11-7,Raj>does it make you feel exposed?

362
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,250
<11-7,Raj>仿佛她们看到了咱们的裸体一样
<11-7,Raj>Like they see you naked?

363
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,580
<11-8,Stuart>她们没有尖叫着逃开  所以还好

<12-1,Amy>It made me want to live on a farm so much

366
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,630
<12-1,Amy>我甚至去给我的猫挤奶
<12-1,Amy>I tried to milk my cat.

367
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
<12-1,Amy>结果猫奶泡麦圈臭死了
<12-1,Amy>That tangy bowl of Cheerios

368
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,210
<12-1,Amy>亏我还被猫抓到要去缝针
<12-1,Amy>was not worth the stitches.

369
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,140
<12-2,Sheldon>你乖乖坐好  放轻松
<12-2,Sheldon>Well, you sit back, relax

372
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,820
<12-2,Sheldon>相关资料说  是非法侵占印第安人的土地建的
<12-2,Sheldon>I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land.

373
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,600
<12-2,Sheldon>是的
<12-2,Sheldon>Yeah.

374
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
<12-2,Sheldon>就个人而言  我觉得我们
<12-2,Sheldon>Personally, I think what we did

375
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,640
<12-2,Sheldon>对印第安人的所作所为是错的
<12-2,Sheldon>to the Native Americans was wrong,

376
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,140
<12-2,Sheldon>但这是你最喜欢的电视剧  不是我的
<12-2,Sheldon>but this is your favorite show, not mine.

377
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,550
<12-2,Sheldon>你瞧小劳拉·英格尔斯
<12-2,Sheldon>Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls,

378
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,780
<12-2,Sheldon>居然在吃花生酱三明治
<12-2,Sheldon>eating that peanut butter sandwich.

379
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,640
<12-2,Sheldon>花生酱
<12-2,Sheldon>Peanut butter?!

380
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,510
<12-2,Sheldon>真奇怪  因为花生酱
<12-2,Sheldon>That's strange, since peanut butter

381
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,050
<12-2,Sheldon>直到20世纪初才出现
<12-2,Sheldon>wasn't introduced until the early 1900s.

382
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,970
<12-2,Sheldon>如果早知道这是部时光穿越剧
<12-2,Sheldon>If I knew this show was about time travel,

383
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,740
<12-2,Sheldon>我想我早就看了
<12-2,Sheldon>I would have watched it much sooner.

384
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,000
<12-3,Amy>你是在报复我
<12-3,Amy>You're trying to get back at me

385
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,970
<12-3,Amy>说了《夺宝奇兵》的坏话
<12-3,Amy>for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.

386
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,690
<12-4,Sheldon>这话真傻
<12-4,Sheldon>That's silly.

387
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,420
<12-4,Sheldon>傻到和贝克医生有电话一样
<12-4,Sheldon>Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone,

388
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,620
<12-4,Sheldon>因为在那个年代
<12-4,Sheldon>since telephones only existed

389
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,170
<12-4,Sheldon>只有大城市才有电话
<12-4,Sheldon>in large cities at that time.

390
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,000
<12-4,Sheldon>这部剧应该叫做《荒谬之地的小木屋》
<12-4,Sheldon>This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.

391
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,950
<12-5,Amy>谢尔顿  我们在谈恋爱
<12-5,Amy>Sheldon, we're in a relationship.

392
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,530
<12-5,Amy>如果你生气  告诉我就行了
<12-5,Amy>When you get angry, just tell me.

393
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,810
<12-5,Amy>你不必偷偷想办法报复
<12-5,Amy>You don't need to seek revenge.

394
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,710
<12-5,Amy>你确定吗
<12-5,Amy>Are you sure?

395
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,510
<12-6,Sheldon>每次我爸彻夜未归
<12-6,Sheldon>Every time my dad stayed out all night,

396
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,180
<12-6,Sheldon>我妈就会把仓鼠屎放进他的嚼用烟草里
<12-6,Sheldon>my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.

397
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,050
<12-7,Amy>我们不会这样
<12-7,Amy>Well, that's not how we're going to do it.

398
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,700
<12-7,Amy>好的
<12-7,Amy>Fine.

399
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,480
<12-8,Sheldon>我是在生气
<12-8,Sheldon>I'm mad at you.

400
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,510
<12-8,Sheldon>你不仅毁了《夺宝奇兵》在我心中的形象
<12-8,Sheldon>Not only did you ruin Raiders for me,

401
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,080
<12-8,Sheldon>甚至可能整个系列都毁了
<12-8,Sheldon>you may have ruined the whole franchise.

402
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,500
<12-8,Sheldon>除了第四部
<12-8,Sheldon>Except for the fourth one,

403
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,330
<12-8,Sheldon>被你的脏手染指之前就是部烂片了
<12-8,Sheldon>which was bad before you got your mitts on it.

404
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,770
<12-9,Amy>我不应该说那些话
<12-9,Amy>I-I shouldn't have said it.

405
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,330
<12-9,Amy>对不起
<12-9,Amy>I'm sorry.

406
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,030
<12-10,Sheldon>谢谢
<12-10,Sheldon>Thank you.

407
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,160
<12-11,Amy>你心情好些了吗
<12-11,Amy>Do you feel better?

408
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,670
<12-11,Amy>是的
<12-11,Amy>Yes.

409
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,270
<12-12,Sheldon>不过在我告诉你  你心爱的加菲猫
<12-12,Sheldon>But not as good as I'm going to when I tell you

410
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,100
<12-12,Sheldon>没理由恨周一后  我的心情会更好
<12-12,Sheldon>that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays.

411
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,310
<12-12,Sheldon>他是只猫  他周一又不用去上班
<12-12,Sheldon>He's a cat. He doesn't have a job.

412
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,480
<13-1,Leonard>我正好...  这是怎么回事
<13-1,Leonard>Hey, I was just-- what is happening?

413
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,280
<13-2,Penny>想让你开心一下
<13-2,Penny>Oh, just a little treat.

414
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,810
<13-2,Penny>我知道你最近因为你妈妈的事
<13-2,Penny>I know you've been feeling really bad

415
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,610
<13-2,Penny>很难过
<13-2,Penny>about your mom lately.

416
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,990
<13-3,Leonard>是难过
<13-3,Leonard>Oh, oh, I have.

417
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,460
<13-3,Leonard>的确好难过
<13-3,Leonard>So bad.

418
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,780
<13-4,Penny>我想让你心情好些
<13-4,Penny>And I wanted to make you feel better,

419
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,810
<13-4,Penny>所以我为你计划了特别的安排
<13-4,Penny>so I planned something very special for you.

420
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,490
<13-5,Leonard>我已经感觉到安排在起作用了
<13-5,Leonard>I can already feel it working.

421
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,910
<13-6,Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam)>你好  莱纳德
<13-6,Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam)>Hello, Leonard.

422
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,620
<13-7,Leonard>妈
<13-7,Leonard>Mom?!

423
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,880
<13-8,Mrs Hofstadter>我听说你一直在抱怨我的为母之道
<13-8,Mrs Hofstadter>I understand you have been whining about my parenting

424
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,760
<13-8,Mrs Hofstadter>以此在感情上来操控你的女友
<13-8,Mrs Hofstadter>in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.

425
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
<13-9,Leonard>我...
<13-9,Leonard>I... uh...

426
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,730
<13-10,Penny>伯纳黛特把一切都告诉我了
<13-10,Penny>Bernadette told me everything.

427
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,490
<13-10,Penny>现在左右咪咪都没你的份了
<13-10,Penny>Now you don't get the left or the right.

428
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,600
<13-11,Mrs Hofstadter>我们来讨论下你为什么一直将我牵扯进
<13-11,Mrs Hofstadter>Let's discuss why you continue to involve me

429
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,950
<13-11,Mrs Hofstadter>你的性生活中
<13-11,Mrs Hofstadter>in your sex life.

430
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,840
<13-12,Leonard>别这样  妈咪
<13-12,Leonard>Oh, please, Mommy.

431
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,500
<13-12,Leonard>不要啦  妈咪
<13-12,Leonard>No, Mommy.

432
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,730
<13-13,Mrs Hofstadter>你六岁时
<13-13,Mrs Hofstadter>When you were six years old,

433
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,350
<13-13,Mrs Hofstadter>走进房间  撞到我和你父亲光着身子
<13-13,Mrs Hofstadter>you walked in on me and your father naked.

434
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
<13-13,Mrs Hofstadter>我当时用你崭新的
<13-13,Mrs Hofstadter>I was swatting his bottom

435
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,960
<13-13,Mrs Hofstadter>乒乓球拍猛抽他的屁股
<13-13,Mrs Hofstadter>with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.

436
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,040
<13-14,Leonard>那原来不是我做梦吗
<13-14,Leonard>I didn't dream that?

437
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,820
<13-15,Mrs Hofstadter>那件事让你感觉如何
<13-15,Mrs Hofstadter>How did that make you feel?

438
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,420
<13-16,Leonard>佩妮  回来吧
<13-16,Leonard>Penny, come back!

439
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,640
<13-16,Leonard>我现在真的难过了
<13-16,Leonard>I'm sad for real now!

440
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,710
<14-1,Raj>在过去两个小时内
<14-1,Raj>In the last two hours,

441
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,870
<14-1,Raj>162位女性看过了我们的个人资料
<14-1,Raj>162 women have read our profiles.

442
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,620
<14-1,Raj>其中有多少人给我们发了消息
<14-1,Raj>How many of them have sent us messages?

443
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,360
<14-2,Stuart>-加起来吗  -是的
<14-2,Stuart>- Combined? - Yes.

444
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,980
<14-4,Stuart>零
<14-4,Stuart>Zero.

445
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,160
<14-5,Raj>哥们  这真是太残忍了
<14-5,Raj>Dude, this is... this is brutal.

446
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,020
<14-6,Stuart>我从未有过如此强烈的被拒绝感
<14-6,Stuart>I don't think I've ever felt so rejected.

447
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,900
<14-6,Stuart>我曾经救过一只流浪狗
<14-6,Stuart>And I had a rescue dog

448
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,380
<14-6,Stuart>它跑回收容所时  我都没这么难过
<14-6,Stuart>who ran back to the pound.

449
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
<14-7,Raj>这真是太惨了
<14-7,Raj>This is the worst.

450
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,900
<14-7,Raj>早知道结果会这样
<14-7,Raj>If we're gonna get shot down,

451
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,840
<14-7,Raj>还不如去酒吧
<14-7,Raj>we might as well just go to a bar

452
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
<14-7,Raj>用老方法泡妞
<14-7,Raj>and do it old school.

453
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,680
<14-8,Stuart>至少能跟她们面对面交流
<14-8,Stuart>And make them look us in the eye.

454
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,870
<14-9,Raj>无论如何也比这样强
<14-9,Raj>Yeah, anything is better than this.

455
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,300
<15-1,Raj>你好
<15-1,Raj>Hello.

456
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,060
<15-2,Girl>没兴趣
<15-2,Girl>Not interested.

457
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,140
<15-3,Raj>我错了  这个更惨
<15-3,Raj>I was wrong. This is worse.

458
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,760
<15-3,Raj>等等  如果不是因为印第安纳·琼斯
<15-3,Raj>Wait, wait-- if it wasn't for Indiana Jones,

459
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,050
<16-1,Howard>法柜根本不会到仓库
<16-1,Howard>the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse!

460
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,560
<16-2,Sheldon>的确如此
<16-2,Sheldon>That's true!

461
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,740
<16-2,Sheldon>他找到并运送了法柜
<16-2,Sheldon>He collected and delivered the ark

462
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,800
<16-2,Sheldon>到有关当局备案
<16-2,Sheldon>to the proper authorities for filing.

463
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
<16-3,Raj>像英雄一般
<16-3,Raj>Like a hero!

464
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,960
<16-4,All>-就是  -太棒了
<16-4,All>- Yeah! Yes! - Right!

465
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,700
<16-5,Leonard>不过  确切来说
<16-5,Leonard>Although, technically,

466
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,160
<16-5,Leonard>印第安纳·琼斯本应该把法柜
<16-5,Leonard>Indy was supposed to take the ark

467
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,060
<16-5,Leonard>送到博物馆做研究
<16-5,Leonard>to a museum to be studied.

468
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,580
<16-5,Leonard>他连这事也没办好
<16-5,Leonard>He couldn't even get that done.
