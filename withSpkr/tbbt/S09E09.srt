32
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,840
<1-20,Bernadette>你明明说这是史上最烂的活动
<1-20,Bernadette>You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.

33
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,310
<1-21,Howard>如果我撒谎时你不挺我
<1-21,Howard>If you can't support me when I'm lying,

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,510
<1-21,Howard>那我们结婚干嘛

35
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,890
<1-21,Howard>翻译：刺鳐章鱼海龟赛  珊瑚水母鲨鱼猫
<1-21,Howard>别扭大菜苏一脸

45
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,980
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>谢尔顿  有什么事吗
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>Hi, Sheldon. What's up?

46
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,140
<2-2,Sheldon>我打来是因为感恩节马上要到了
<2-2,Sheldon>Well, I'm calling because Thanksgiving is coming up,

47
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,380
<2-2,Sheldon>我想送你水族馆的票
<2-2,Sheldon>and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.

48
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,830
<2-3,Amy>没人可以陪你去吗
<2-3,Amy>No one can go with you?

49
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,460
<2-4,Sheldon>没有  他们宁愿聚在一起过节
<2-4,Sheldon>No. They'd rather spend the holiday with each other

50
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,200
<2-4,Sheldon>也不想知道今年我会不会终于敢摸海星
<2-4,Sheldon>than find out if this is the year I finally touch a starfish.

51
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,680
<2-4,Sheldon>我不想票就这么浪费了
<2-4,Sheldon>Anyway, I wouldn't want the tickets to go to waste,

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,640
<2-4,Sheldon>所以你想带谁去就带谁去吧
<2-4,Sheldon>so take whomever you'd like.

53
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,530
<2-5,Amy>好吧  谢谢
<2-5,Amy>Okay. Thank you.

54
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,460
<2-6,Sheldon>我不介意你跟你的伴说
<2-6,Sheldon>And feel free to tell your guest that

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,250
<2-6,Sheldon>缅甸鲶鱼又称移民鱼这个小知识
<2-6,Sheldon>the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish.

56
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,120
<2-6,Sheldon>以防到时火鸡肉太干
<2-6,Sheldon>In case the turkey's dry

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,960
<2-6,Sheldon>而你需要多汁有料的知识救场
<2-6,Sheldon>and you need something juicy.

58
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,660
<2-7,Amy>谢尔顿  我看得出来你很想去
<2-7,Amy>Sheldon... I can tell you want to go,

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,250
<2-7,Amy>所以如果你不介意的话
<2-7,Amy>so if you'd be comfortable with it,

60
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,890
<2-7,Amy>我们能以朋友身份一起去啊
<2-7,Amy>maybe we could go as friends.

61
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,990
<2-8,Sheldon>你不会觉得这很尴尬吗
<2-8,Sheldon>You don't think that will be awkward?

62
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,340
<2-9,Amy>感恩节在水族馆饭堂里吃饭
<2-9,Amy>Well... it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria,

63
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,140
<2-9,Amy>我猜应该是会挺尴尬吧
<2-9,Amy>so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes.

64
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,270
<2-9,Amy>但如果你是说我俩之间
<2-9,Amy>But if you mean between us...

65
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,350
<2-9,Amy>我不觉得会尴尬
<2-9,Amy>I think it'll be fine.

66
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,130
<2-10,Sheldon>那行
<2-10,Sheldon>Very well, then.

67
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,080
<2-10,Sheldon>感恩节早上见吧

<2-11,Amy>到时见
<2-11,Amy>See you then.

69
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,540
<2-12,Sheldon>先忘了我刚说的缅甸鲶鱼小知识吧
<2-12,Sheldon>Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish.

70
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,980
<2-12,Sheldon>我的海洋主题移民小知识列表还挺短的
<2-12,Sheldon>My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.

71
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,780
<2-13,Amy>你知道史上第一次过感恩节的时候
<2-13,Amy>Did you know they served shellfish and eel

72
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,200
<2-13,Amy>上桌的菜还有贝类跟鳗鱼吗
<2-13,Amy>at the very first Thanksgiving?

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,370
<2-14,Sheldon>小知识列表到此完毕了
<2-14,Sheldon>And there goes my list.

74
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,700
<3-1,Emily>所以这是怎么个运作方式
<3-1,Emily>So, how does this work?

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,860
<3-2,Bernadette>粥棚经理会给我们分配工作
<3-2,Bernadette>The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs,

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,020
<3-2,Bernadette>一个班次是六小时
<3-2,Bernadette>and the shifts are six hours.

77
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,340
<3-3,Howard>要六小时啊
<3-3,Howard>Six hours?

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,090
<3-3,Howard>天啊  人家不想哇哇叫这么长时间啊
<3-3,Howard>Oh, God, I don't want to complain for that long.

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,110
<3-4,Raj>你这辈子有为别人付出过吗
<3-4,Raj>Do you ever do anything for anyone else?

80
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,790
<3-5,Howard>小爷恰好是一位乐于"奉献"的爱人
<3-5,Howard>I happen to be a giving and generous lover.

81
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,900
<3-6,Emily>我跟你的关系好到可以说他很变态了吗
<3-6,Emily>Are you and I close enough for me to say that's creepy?

82
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,570
<3-7,Bernadette>可以  而且我觉得你想说的字眼应该是"恶"
<3-7,Bernadette>We are, and I believe the word you're looking for is... yech!

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,500
<3-8,Soup Kitchen Manager>有什么能帮忙的吗
<3-8,Soup Kitchen Manager>Uh, can I help you?

<3-11,Bernadette>收起你脸上欠扁的笑容
<3-11,Bernadette>Wipe that smug smile off your face.

90
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,460
<3-12,Howard>我只是因为听到很多人来帮助不幸的人们
<3-12,Howard>Maybe I'm happy that so many people turned up

91
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,490
<3-12,Howard>心中乐开了花而已啊
<3-12,Howard>to help the less fortunate.

<3-14,Bernadette>That he's an ass? He beat you to it.

94
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,220
<3-15,Soup Kitchen Manager>我说错了  有一大批人来不了了
<3-15,Soup Kitchen Manager>I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.

95
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,800
<3-16,Bernadette>太好了  我们很乐意帮忙
<3-16,Bernadette>Oh, great. We'd love to help.

<4-20,Leonard>and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.

129
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,620
<4-21,Penny>快瞧我们俩
<4-21,Penny>Oh, look at us.

130
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,680
<4-21,Penny>最后一次以夫妻身份过感恩节
<4-21,Penny>Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.

131
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,660
<5-1,Sheldon>你好啊
<5-1,Sheldon>Hello.

132
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,480
<5-1,Sheldon>你好
<5-1,Sheldon>Hi.

133
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,310
<5-2,Amy>准备好要去水族馆了吗
<5-2,Amy>Ready for the aquarium?

134
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,620
<5-2,Amy>当然
<5-2,Amy>I am.

135
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,370
<5-3,Sheldon>对了  为了要减少尴尬
<5-3,Sheldon>You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness

136
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,920
<5-3,Sheldon>我们还得练习以朋友关系相处
<5-3,Sheldon>as we learn how to function as friends,

137
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,110
<5-3,Sheldon>我特意打了一张不会触碰地雷的聊天话题
<5-3,Sheldon>I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.

138
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,880
<5-4,Amy>这样你会好受点的话  那行吧
<5-4,Amy>If that makes you more comfortable.

139
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,290
<5-5,Sheldon>如果真有"能让我好受的事情"的列表
<5-5,Sheldon>If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable,

140
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,110
<5-5,Sheldon>列表上的第一件就会是"列表"
<5-5,Sheldon>lists would be on the top of that list.

141
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,630
<5-5,Sheldon>好了  我看看
<5-5,Sheldon>Okay, now... Oh.

142
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,370
<5-7,Sheldon>"我们最后一次交谈后  你有开始养宠物吗"
<5-7,Sheldon>"Since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?"

143
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,310
<5-6,Amy>没有  你呢
<5-6,Amy>No. You?

144
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,800
<5-6,Amy>没有
<5-6,Amy>No.

145
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,510
<5-7,Sheldon>"我们上次交谈后
<5-7,Sheldon>Um, "Since last we spoke,

146
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,570
<5-7,Sheldon>你有计划要去  或已经去哪里度假了吗"
<5-7,Sheldon>have you planned or gone on any vacations?"

147
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,010
<5-8,Amy>我可能下周会去探视我阿姨
<5-8,Amy>I might go visit my aunt next week.

148
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,620
<5-9,Sheldon>你在莫德斯托市的那个阿姨吗
<5-9,Sheldon>Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?

149
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,250
<5-10,Amy>不是  是住在贝克斯菲尔德市的那位
<5-10,Amy>No, the one in Bakersfield.

150
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,520
<5-11,Sheldon>贝克斯菲尔德市  了解
<5-11,Sheldon>Bakersfield. I see.

151
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,400
<5-11,Sheldon>这张列表怎么才出现在我的人生中
<5-11,Sheldon>Where has this list been all my life?

152
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,820
<6-1,Soup Kitchen Manager>你们今天就负责洗碗
<6-1,Soup Kitchen Manager>We're gonna have you washing dishes.

153
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,340
<6-1,Soup Kitchen Manager>围裙跟橡胶手套在这里  就...
<6-1,Soup Kitchen Manager>Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here-- just...

154
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,200
<6-1,Soup Kitchen Manager>刷  洗  叠就对了
<6-1,Soup Kitchen Manager>scrape, wash and stack.

155
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,970
<6-1,Soup Kitchen Manager>有事就叫我  我会过来
<6-1,Soup Kitchen Manager>If you need me, I'll be around.

156
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,260
<6-2,Howard>我们连战场前线都去不了吗
<6-2,Howard>So we don't even get to be up front where the action is?

157
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,910
<6-3,Bernadette>有什么差别啊
<6-3,Bernadette>What difference does it make?

158
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,740
<6-4,Howard>不知道  我还希望会有可怜兮兮的小孩
<6-4,Howard>I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid

159
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,280
<6-4,Howard>走到我面前跟我说
<6-4,Howard>would come up to me and say,

160
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,440
<6-4,Howard>先生  求求你  再多给我点儿吧
<6-4,Howard>Please, sir, I want some more.

161
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,670
<6-5,Raj>你丫是在粥棚工作
<6-5,Raj>You're in a soup kitchen,

162
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,830
<6-5,Raj>不是在《雾都孤儿》音乐剧现场
<6-5,Raj>not a production of Oliver!

163
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,980
<6-6,Howard>我又不指望他们会唱出来
<6-6,Howard>It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.

164
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,430
<6-6,Howard>然后隔天是73度
<6-6,Howard>...and then the next day was 73 degrees,

165
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,310
<7-1,Sheldon>再之后一天是72度
<7-1,Sheldon>and the day after that was 72,

166
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,920
<7-1,Sheldon>再往后又是72度
<7-1,Sheldon>and then it was 72 again...

167
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,810
<7-1,Sheldon>再后来是74度
<7-1,Sheldon>uh, then it was 74,

168
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,830
<7-1,Sheldon>接着就到今天了  是...
<7-1,Sheldon>and that brings us to today, at--

169
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,040
<7-1,Sheldon>如果我有短裤我肯定穿的78度[25.5摄氏度]
<7-1,Sheldon>I'd wear shorts if I had a pair-- 78.

170
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,900
<7-2,Amy>我们讨论完天气了吗
<7-2,Amy>Are we done discussing the weather?

171
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,810
<7-3,Sheldon>我觉得我们这称不上"讨论"啊
<7-3,Sheldon>I don't know if I'd call it "discussing".

172
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,880
<7-3,Sheldon>你就光坐在那  全都是我在论
<7-3,Sheldon>You kind of sat back and let me do all the work.

173
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,830
<7-3,Sheldon>看看列表上的下一项
<7-3,Sheldon>Let's see what's next on the list.

<7-3,Sheldon>and if so, what kind of knife do you..."

176
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,750
<7-3,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<7-3,Sheldon>Sheldon.

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,260
<7-4,Amy>我们绝对能正常地谈天说地
<7-4,Amy>We are perfectly capable of having a conversation

179
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,940
<7-4,Amy>不用靠网上的某张列表
<7-4,Amy>without relying on a list off the Internet.

180
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,540
<7-4,Amy>好吧

<7-6,Amy>不知道  你想到什么就问什么吧
<7-6,Amy>I don't know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.

183
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,790
<7-6,Amy>好的
<7-6,Amy>Very well.

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,680
<7-7,Sheldon>我知道你有跟别的男人约会

<7-7,Sheldon>你跟他们之中任何一人交媾过了吗
<7-7,Sheldon>Have you had coitus with any of them?

186
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,800
<7-8,Amy>靠  我真是挖坑给自己跳
<7-8,Amy>Man, I walked right into that one.

187
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,700
<8-1,Leonard>接下来我们需要一茶匙的胡椒
<8-1,Leonard>Next we need a teaspoon of pepper,

188
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,220
<8-1,Leonard>你小时候养的狗也正好叫胡椒
<8-1,Leonard>which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.

189
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,180
<8-2,Penny>行  你觉得你知道很多是吧

<8-9,Leonard>Face it, you can't stump me--

200
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,710
<8-9,Leonard>我就是丈夫之王
<8-9,Leonard>I am the king of husbands.

201
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,110
<8-9,Leonard>我还知道你不喜欢我情人节
<8-9,Leonard>I know that you don't like the lingerie

202
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,530
<8-9,Leonard>送你的那套内衣
<8-9,Leonard>that I got you on Valentine's Day.

203
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,620
<8-9,Leonard>我还知道你讨厌"湿润"这个词
<8-9,Leonard>I know you hate the word "moist". I know...

204
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,410
<8-10,Penny>等等

205
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,260
<8-10,Penny>等等  我为什么会不喜欢你送我的内衣
<8-10,Penny>Wait, wait. Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?

206
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,880
<8-11,Leonard>因为它是橘色的
<8-11,Leonard>Because it's orange

207
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,270
<8-11,Leonard>你觉得自己穿起来时像淫荡的胡萝卜
<8-11,Leonard>and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.

208
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,610
<8-12,Penny>有意思
<8-12,Penny>Interesting.

209
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,860
<8-12,Penny>我从没告诉过你这件事
<8-12,Penny>I never told you that.

210
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,530
<8-13,Leonard>你当然说过
<8-13,Leonard>Sure you did.

211
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,090
<5-6,Amy>并没有
<5-6,Amy>No.

212
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,290
<8-13,Leonard>我从没跟任何人说过
<8-13,Leonard>I never told anyone that.

213
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,770
<8-14,Penny>但我有写在我的日记里
<8-14,Penny>But I did write it in my journal.

214
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,330
<8-14,Penny>什么
<8-14,Penny>What?

215
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,920
<8-15,Leonard>我都不知道你有日记
<8-15,Leonard>I didn't know you had a journal.

216
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,470
<8-16,Penny>我还知道你撒谎时音调就变高
<8-16,Penny>I also know your voice gets higher when you're lying.

217
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,070
<8-17,Leonard>人家才没有呢
<8-17,Leonard>No, it doesn't.

218
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,210
<9-1,Raj>这让我想起了我高中时代
<9-1,Raj>You know, this reminds me of high school.

219
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,990
<9-2,Emily>你在餐厅打工过吗
<9-2,Emily>You worked in a restaurant?

220
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,100
<9-3,Raj>不  我当时还在印度  又潮味儿又大
<9-3,Raj>No, I was in India-- it was humid and smelled funny.

221
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,560
<9-4,Howard>我好像开始进入状态了
<9-4,Howard>All right, I think I'm getting into a groove here.

222
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,550
<9-4,Howard>其实也不坏嘛
<9-4,Howard>This isn't so bad.

223
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,140
<9-5,Emly>再过5个小时40分钟就结束了
<9-5,Emly>Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.

224
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,470
<9-6,Howard>刚才洗这么久了  才过了20分钟吗
<9-6,Howard>We've only been doing this 20 minutes?!

225
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,180
<9-7,Raj>我在哪里读过
<9-7,Raj>You know, I read that

226
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,080
<9-7,Raj>洗碗也能是一种很好的冥想方式
<9-7,Raj>washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation.

227
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,240
<9-7,Raj>重点在于当你在洗碗时
<9-7,Raj>The key is that while washing the dishes

228
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,610
<9-7,Raj>身心灵该关注于...  洗碗
<9-7,Raj>one should only be... washing the dishes.

229
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,020
<9-8,Howard>虽然你有那异国东方口音
<9-8,Howard>Just because you have that accent

230
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,300
<9-8,Howard>但不代表你说的话听起来就不傻逼
<9-8,Howard>doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.

231
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,990
<9-9,Raj>不  说真的
<9-9,Raj>No, seriously.

232
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,350
<9-9,Raj>重点是活在当下
<9-9,Raj>It's about being present in the moment,

233
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,360
<9-9,Raj>用心去感受水的温热
<9-9,Raj>focusing on the feeling of the warm water,

234
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,130
<9-9,Raj>洗洁精的味道
<9-9,Raj>the smell of the detergent,

235
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,520
<9-9,Raj>盘子的磨蹭声  跟随自己的呼吸
<9-9,Raj>the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath.

236
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,590
<9-9,Raj>天地之间  活在当下
<9-9,Raj>It's about... it's about simply being.

237
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,000
<9-10,Howard>好吧  我试试
<9-10,Howard>Okay. I'll try it.

238
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,100
<9-11,Soup Kitchen Manager>外面需要三个人帮忙
<9-11,Soup Kitchen Manager>I need three people out front.

239
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,060
<9-12,Bernadette>我去
<9-12,Bernadette>I'll do it!

240
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,310
<9-14,Emily>-我去  -马上来
<9-14,Emily>- Me! - Right here!

241
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,140
<9-15,Howard>不公平  人家刚在冥想呢
<9-15,Howard>No fair! I was meditating!

242
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,970
<10-1,Leonard>别生气嘛
<10-1,Leonard>Come on, don't be mad.

243
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,410
<10-1,Leonard>那是很久以前的事了  完全是意外
<10-1,Leonard>It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.

244
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,110
<10-2,Penny>偷看我日记怎么会是意外呢
<10-2,Penny>How can reading my journal be an accident?

245
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,350
<10-3,Leonard>我根本不知道那是什么
<10-3,Leonard>I didn't even know what it was.

246
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,580
<10-3,Leonard>我看放在床头柜上  就顺手拿起来翻
<10-3,Leonard>I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.

247
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,600
<10-4,Penny>那你知道是日记后  干嘛还不住手
<10-4,Penny>Well, when you realized what it was, why didn't you stop?

248
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,410
<10-5,Leonard>你也知道我  我是爱阅读的四眼书虫
<10-5,Leonard>You know me, I'm a big ol' bookworm.

249
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,110
<10-6,Penny>算了  赶紧把饭做完吧
<10-6,Penny>All right. Let's just finish cooking.

250
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,140
<10-7,Leonard>好啦好啦  让我补偿你吧
<10-7,Leonard>Well... Hey. O-Okay. Let me make this up to you.

251
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,170
<10-7,Leonard>有时我会在网上写日记
<10-7,Leonard>Sometimes I keep an online journal.

252
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,470
<10-7,Leonard>我想让你读我写的东西
<10-7,Leonard>I want you to read something that I write.

253
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,260
<10-8,Penny>不用了  我不想读
<10-8,Penny>Okay, really, I'm fine.

254
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,940
<10-8,Penny>好吧
<10-8,Penny>Okay.

255
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
<10-9,Leonard>那我读给你听好了
<10-9,Leonard>Well, then I'll read it to you.

256
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,390
<10-9,Leonard>这篇是我们第一次见面时写的
<10-9,Leonard>It's from the day we first met.

257
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,250
<10-9,Leonard>-"邻之佳人  名为佩妮"  -求闭嘴
<10-9,Leonard>"Beauty, thy name is Penny." - Oh, God. Stop.

258
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,490
<10-10,Penny>我不想你读一些你自认为恭维我的好话
<10-10,Penny>I don't want you to read something you think'll just butter me up.

259
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,940
<10-10,Penny>我想听你最新写的日记
<10-10,Penny>I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.

260
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,550
<10-10,Penny>好

<10-11,Leonard>"佩妮的美  就像我们的爱
<10-11,Leonard>"Penny's beauty, like our love,

262
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,960
<10-11,Leonard>一天比一天更甚"
<10-11,Leonard>grows more with each passing day."

263
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,370
<10-12,Penny>上面真的这么写吗
<10-12,Penny>Does it really say that?

264
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,980
<10-13,Leonard>我干嘛要撒谎
<10-13,Leonard>Why would I lie?

265
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,780
<10-14,Penny>"天了噜  天了噜
<10-14,Penny>"Omg. Omg.

266
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,650
<10-14,Penny>新的《星球大战》电影即将上映
<10-14,Penny>We're so close to the new Star Wars.

267
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,590
<10-14,Penny>我的小心脏要受不了了
<10-14,Penny>I can't take it.

268
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,030
<10-14,Penny>哇噢"
<10-14,Penny>Gah."

269
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,470
<10-14,Penny>"哇噢"
<10-14,Penny>"Gah"?

270
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,570
<10-15,Leonard>你念的语气不对
<10-15,Leonard>Well, you didn't read it right.

271
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,140
<10-15,Leonard>新的《星球大战》电影即将上映  哇呼
<10-15,Leonard>The new Star Wars is coming. Gah!

272
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,470
<11-1,Sheldon>我感觉到气氛变尴尬了
<11-1,Sheldon>I'm sensing things have gotten awkward.

273
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,890
<11-2,Amy>不  没关系
<11-2,Amy>No. It's okay.

274
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,010
<11-2,Amy>如果我们是朋友  我们就该无所不谈
<11-2,Amy>If we're friends, we should be able to talk about anything.

275
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,630
<11-3,Sheldon>好吧
<11-3,Sheldon>All right.

276
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,310
<11-4,Amy>你对我跟其他人约会有一些疑问
<11-4,Amy>So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.

277
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,860
<11-5,Sheldon>就几个小问题
<11-5,Sheldon>Just a few.

278
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,420
<11-6,Amy>问吧
<11-6,Amy>Go ahead.

279
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,780
<11-7,Sheldon>你约过几次会
<11-7,Sheldon>How many dates have you been on?

280
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,830
<11-7,Sheldon>都跟谁约会  都去了哪里
<11-7,Sheldon>Who were they with? Where'd you go?

281
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,240
<11-7,Sheldon>你在哪里认识他们的  你跟他们睡了吗
<11-7,Sheldon>Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them?

282
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,770
<11-7,Sheldon>还有多久到水族馆
<11-7,Sheldon>And how much longer to the aquarium?

283
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,810
<11-7,Sheldon>我有点饿了
<11-7,Sheldon>I'm getting kind of hungry.

284
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,170
<11-7,Sheldon>我们一题一题答
<11-7,Sheldon>Let's see.

285
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,200
<11-8,Amy>我一共约会了六次  分别跟三个不同的人
<11-8,Amy>I have been on six dates with three different people.

286
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,640
<11-8,Amy>不是去喝咖啡  就是吃饭
<11-8,Amy>It was either for coffee or dinner.

287
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,550
<11-8,Amy>一个是在书店认识的  其余两个是在网上
<11-8,Amy>One I met at a bookstore and two I met online.

288
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,060
<11-8,Amy>我没有跟任何一个睡
<11-8,Amy>I haven't slept with anyone.

289
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,720
<11-8,Amy>还有40分钟才能到水族馆
<11-8,Amy>The aquarium is 40 minutes away.

290
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,270
<11-8,Amy>我给你准备了麦圈
<11-8,Amy>And there's a baggie of Cheerios for you

291
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,800
<11-8,Amy>在杂物箱里
<11-8,Amy>in the glove compartment.

292
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,580
<11-9,Sheldon>原味的还是蜂蜜坚果味
<11-9,Sheldon>Uh, regular or honey nut?

293
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,150
<11-10,Amy>我把两者混到一起了
<11-10,Amy>I mixed them.

294
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,750
<11-10,Amy>你把两者混到一起了
<11-10,Amy>You mixed them.

295
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,090
<11-11,Sheldon>怪不得男人如雪片般飞来
<11-11,Sheldon>No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door.

296
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,280
<11-11,Sheldon>你有问题要问我吗
<11-11,Sheldon>Do you have any questions for me?

297
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,150
<11-12,Amy>就一个
<11-12,Amy>Just one.

298
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,750
<11-12,Amy>你还好吗
<11-12,Amy>Are you doing okay?

299
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,580
<11-13,Sheldon>好啊
<11-13,Sheldon>I am.

300
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,950
<11-14,Amy>那就好

301
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,230
<11-14,Amy>我希望你快乐
<11-14,Amy>I-I want you to be happy.

302
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,890
<11-15,Sheldon>我相信你是
<11-15,Sheldon>I believe you.

303
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,560
<11-15,Sheldon>如果你再放点苹果肉桂脆片  就更有说服力了
<11-15,Sheldon>I'd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.

304
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,910
<12-1,Man>给
<12-1,Man>Here you go.

<12-1,Man>谢谢
<12-1,Man>Thanks.

306
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,840
<12-2,Howard>开什么玩笑
<12-2,Howard>You got to be kidding me.

307
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,100
<12-3,Man>什么
<12-3,Man>Sorry?

308
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,700
<12-4,Howard>你是埃隆·马斯克

<12-5,Elon>正是在下
<12-5,Elon>I am.

311
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,780
<12-6,Howard>你在这里干什么
<12-6,Howard>Wh-What are you doing here?

312
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,930
<9-7,Raj>我来刷盘子啊
<9-7,Raj>I'm washing dishes.

313
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,150
<12-7,Elon>我本来是分火鸡的
<12-7,Elon>Well, I was on the turkey line,

314
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,100
<12-7,Elon>但因为肉汁给太多  被下放来刷盘子了
<12-7,Elon>but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.

315
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,630
<12-7,Elon>老天  我...
<12-7,Elon>Oh, man. I...

316
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,830
<12-8,Howard>见到你很荣幸
<12-8,Howard>What an honor to meet you.

317
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,850
<12-8,Howard>我是特斯拉车和太空探索技术公司的粉丝
<12-8,Howard>I'm-I'm such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX.

318
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,420
<12-8,Howard>他还是Paypal[知名第三方在线支付公司]
<12-8,Howard>以及SolarCity[专门发展家用光伏发电项目的公司]的CEO

319
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,320
<12-8,Howard>你所有公司我都爱
<12-8,Howard>All your companies.

<12-8,Howard>加州理工的霍华德·沃罗威茨
<12-8,Howard>Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.

321
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,660
<12-9,Elon>很高兴认识你  霍华德
<12-9,Elon>Nice to meet you, Howard.

322
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,370
<12-9,Elon>来这里帮助不幸的人  感觉不错吧
<12-9,Elon>Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?

323
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,370
<12-9,Elon>是的
<12-9,Elon>Oh, yeah.

324
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,290
<12-10,Howard>助人为乐的感觉最棒了
<12-10,Howard>Nothing better than helping people.

325
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,620
<12-10,Howard>我意识到这点时
<12-10,Howard>Which is something I realized

326
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,490
<12-10,Howard>是在遥远的外太空
<12-10,Howard>when I was viewing Earth

327
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,760
<12-10,Howard>当时我从国际空间站的甲板上瞭望地球
<12-10,Howard>from the deck of the International Space Station,

328
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,060
<12-10,Howard>我以科学宇航员的身份待了两个月
<12-10,Howard>where I spent two months as a payload specialist,

329
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,580
<12-10,Howard>这份工作我完全能胜任
<12-10,Howard>a job I was qualified for

330
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,050
<12-10,Howard>因为我是麻省理工培养出来的工程师
<12-10,Howard>because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

331
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,000
<12-11,Elon>我浇的肉汁得再厚也没你的脸皮厚
<12-11,Elon>And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.

332
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,970
<12-11,Elon>抱歉  只是...
<12-11,Elon>Sorry. It's just...

333
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,550
<12-12,Howard>你真是太了不起了
<12-12,Howard>you're you, you know?

334
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,570
<12-12,Howard>我超希望你能收养我
<12-12,Howard>And I really want you to adopt me.

335
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,680
<12-13,Elon>你在感恩节能出现在这里
<12-13,Elon>Well, you're here on Thanksgiving,

336
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,070
<12-13,Elon>所以你应该是个好人
<12-13,Elon>so you're probably a good person.

337
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,000
<12-14,Howard>我还让我老婆一起来了呢
<12-14,Howard>Oh. I made my wife come down, too.

338
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,000
<12-15,Elon>你觉得你会再次回到外太空吗
<12-15,Elon>You think you might ever get back out to space?

339
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,520
<12-16,Howard>这是工作邀请吗  因为我真的很想去火星
<12-16,Howard>Is that a job offer? 'Cause I really want to go to Mars.

340
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,000
<12-16,Howard>前提是能带上我老婆
<12-16,Howard>Assuming I can bring my wife.

341
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,300
<12-16,Howard>她完全不占地方
<12-16,Howard>She hardly takes up any room.

342
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,970
<12-16,Howard>基本就手提行李大小
<12-16,Howard>She's basically a carry-on.

343
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,590
<12-17,Elon>我们现在还没到那步
<12-17,Elon>Well, we're not quite there yet,

344
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,080
<12-17,Elon>但我们一直在寻找工程师
<12-17,Elon>but we're always looking for engineers.

345
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,620
<12-17,Elon>我把邮箱告诉你  我们保持联系
<12-17,Elon>So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.

346
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,240
<12-18,Howard>谢谢
<12-18,Howard>Thank you.

347
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,200
<12-18,Howard>瞧
<12-18,Howard>Oh, look.

348
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,010
<12-19,Elon>有人的南瓜派几乎没怎么吃
<12-19,Elon>Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie.

349
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,870
<12-19,Elon>你想跟我一起吃吗
<12-19,Elon>Want to share it with me?

350
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,380
<12-20,Howard>跟埃隆·马斯克在收容所
<12-20,Howard>A-a partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie

351
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,270
<12-20,Howard>一起分享
<12-20,Howard>from a homeless shelter?

352
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,980
<12-20,Howard>被吃过的南瓜派  我当然愿意
<12-20,Howard>With Elon Musk, you bet I do!

353
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,070
<13-1,Sheldon>以一个在水族馆餐厅里的
<13-1,Sheldon>You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet

354
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,690
<13-1,Sheldon>感恩节自助餐来说  刚才那顿也太差了
<13-1,Sheldon>in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.

355
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,990
<13-2,Amy>你就是在气他们移民帽发完了
<13-2,Amy>You're just upset 'cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.

356
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,330
<13-3,Sheldon>他们还发给那孩子一顶  他在睡觉要来干嘛
<13-3,Sheldon>They gave one to that baby. He wasn't even awake.

357
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,510
<13-4,Amy>逢年过节怎么少得了你跟孩子上火生气呢
<13-4,Amy>Well, it wouldn't be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.

358
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,090
<13-5,Sheldon>想不想跟我玩一个我发明的海洋主题游戏
<13-5,Sheldon>Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?

359
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,240
<13-6,Amy>当然  什么游戏
<13-6,Amy>Sure. What is it?

360
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,760
<13-7,Sheldon>游戏叫作"食物  朋友  战斗"
<13-7,Sheldon>It's called Food, Friend, Fight.

361
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,120
<13-7,Sheldon>我们中一人选出三种水生生物
<13-7,Sheldon>One of us chooses three aquatic creatures,

362
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,030
<13-7,Sheldon>然后另一人必须决定分别把什么当食物
<13-7,Sheldon>and the other one must decide which he would eat,

363
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,720
<13-7,Sheldon>做朋友  还是与之战斗
<13-7,Sheldon>befriend, or battle.

364
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,980
<13-8,Amy>就像"接吻  结婚  杀掉"
<13-8,Amy>So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.

365
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,020
<13-9,Sheldon>那是什么东西
<13-9,Sheldon>What is that?

366
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,960
<13-10,Amy>那是一个游戏  一方说出三个人
<13-10,Amy>It's a game where you're given three people

367
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,080
<13-10,Amy>另一方选择要跟谁接吻  结婚  杀掉
<13-10,Amy>and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.

368
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,200
<13-11,Sheldon>我的游戏更好  不用跟人结婚
<13-11,Sheldon>Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone,

369
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,080
<13-11,Sheldon>还可以吃掉他们
<13-11,Sheldon>you get to eat them.

370
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,540
<13-12,Amy>我们开始玩吧
<13-12,Amy>Let's just play.

371
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,490
<13-13,Sheldon>开始来点简单的
<13-13,Sheldon>I'll start you off easy.

372
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,290
<13-13,Sheldon>电鳗  河豚  虾
<13-13,Sheldon>Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.

373
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,440
<13-14,Amy>我不会跟电鳗战斗
<13-14,Amy>Well, I wouldn't fight the eel,

374
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,640
<13-14,Amy>因为我知道它产出的电流可以电死一匹马
<13-14,Amy>because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse.

375
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,390
<13-14,Amy>所以我吃掉电鳗
<13-14,Amy>So I'd eat the eel,

376
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,750
<13-14,Amy>与虾战斗
<13-14,Amy>fight the shrimp,

377
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,280
<13-14,Amy>然后与河豚交友
<13-14,Amy>and befriend the pufferfish,

378
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,680
<13-14,Amy>因为我觉得自己水肿的日子里
<13-14,Amy>because it would be nice to have company

379
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,960
<13-14,Amy>有个同病相怜的伙伴挺好的
<13-14,Amy>on those days I feel bloated.

380
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,210
<13-15,Sheldon>答得漂亮
<13-15,Sheldon>Very well done.

381
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,110
<13-15,Sheldon>谢谢
<13-15,Sheldon>Thank you.

382
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,990
<13-16,Amy>好的  到你了
<13-16,Amy>Okay, your turn.

383
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,400
<13-16,Amy>海豹
<13-16,Amy>Hmm. Seal,

384
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,330
<13-18,Amy>盲鳗
<13-18,Amy>hagfish...

385
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,270
<13-16,Amy>海绵宝宝
<13-16,Amy>SpongeBob SquarePants.

386
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,420
<13-17,Sheldon>我想跟海绵宝宝做朋友  但它不是真的
<13-17,Sheldon>Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real,

387
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,180
<13-17,Sheldon>所以我做不到  是不是
<13-17,Sheldon>so I can't do that, can I?

388
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,330
<13-18,Amy>难道你可以跟盲鳗称兄道弟吗
<13-18,Amy>But you can pal around with a hagfish?

389
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,070
<13-19,Sheldon>不要挑刺好吗
<13-19,Sheldon>Hey, let's not pull at that thread.

390
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,870
<13-19,Sheldon>好的  我选择跟海绵宝宝战斗
<13-19,Sheldon>Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob,

391
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,380
<13-19,Sheldon>因为他非常友善
<13-19,Sheldon>because he's so friendly

392
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,170
<13-19,Sheldon>最后我们就变成互相挠痒痒了
<13-19,Sheldon>we'll just end up tickling each other.

393
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,900
<13-19,Sheldon>我会跟海豹做朋友
<13-19,Sheldon>Um, I'll befriend the seal,

394
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,020
<13-19,Sheldon>因为它们可以被人训练
<13-19,Sheldon>because he's trainable, which is the problem

395
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,940
<13-19,Sheldon>而我现在的朋友们正好有这问题
<13-19,Sheldon>I'm having with my current friends.

396
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,230
<13-19,Sheldon>意味着我只能吃掉盲鳗了
<13-19,Sheldon>Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.

397
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,140
<13-20,Amy>不恶心吗  盲鳗一分钟内
<13-20,Amy>Isn't that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce

398
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,810
<13-20,Amy>就可以产出一水桶粘液
<13-20,Amy>enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.

399
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,360
<13-21,Sheldon>我知道  它自带肉汁  非常顺口
<13-21,Sheldon>I know. It makes its own gravy-- it'll slide right down.

400
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,250
<13-22,Amy>我怀念这样
<13-22,Amy>I miss this.

401
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,520
<13-23,Sheldon>你怎么能怀念一个
<13-23,Sheldon>How can you miss a game

402
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,190
<13-23,Sheldon>你从来没玩过的游戏  小傻瓜
<13-23,Sheldon>you've never played before, silly?

403
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,620
<13-24,Amy>或许有时我就是这么傻吧
<13-24,Amy>I guess sometimes I'm silly.

404
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,380
<14-1,Penny>你去哪了  我看不出来火鸡烤没烤好
<14-1,Penny>Hey. Where'd you go? I can't tell if the turkey's done!

405
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,300
<14-2,Leonard>马上来
<14-2,Leonard>Be right there!

406
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,990
<14-2,Leonard>你好啊  爱人
<14-2,Leonard>Hi, lover.

407
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,430
<14-3,Penny>你这是闹哪样啊
<14-3,Penny>What are you doing?

408
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,990
<14-4,Leonard>抱歉看了你日记  我想补偿你
<14-4,Leonard>I'm sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you.

409
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,220
<14-4,Leonard>于是  我决定让你拍下我的耻辱照
<14-4,Leonard>So I'm gonna let you post

410
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,270
<14-4,Leonard>发到脸书上
<14-4,Leonard>a shame photo of me on Facebook.

411
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,270
<14-4,Leonard>我看了我老婆的日记
<14-4,Leonard>我这个淘气的胡萝卜

412
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,660
<14-5,Penny>我才不会把那种东西发到网上
<14-5,Penny>I am not putting that on the Internet!

413
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,980
<14-5,Penny>我不想让大家看到这幅景象
<14-5,Penny>I don't want people to see this.

414
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,620
<14-5,Penny>连我都看不下去了
<14-5,Penny>I don't want to see it!

415
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
<14-6,Leonard>你不想让大家看什么呀
<14-6,Leonard>Don't want people to see what, huh?

416
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,540
<14-6,Leonard>看这样吗
<14-6,Leonard>A little bit of this?

417
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,490
<14-8,Leonard>还是这样啊
<14-8,Leonard>Some of this?

418
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,830
<14-8,Leonard>既然今天是感恩节
<14-8,Leonard>And, since it's Thanksgiving,

419
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,660
<14-8,Leonard>那额外附赠这个
<14-8,Leonard>an extra helping of this?

420
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,980
<14-9,Bernadette>感恩节...
<14-9,Bernadette>Happy Thanks...

421
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,940
<15-1,Leonard>很开心你和艾米相处得愉快
<15-1,Leonard>I'm glad you had a nice time with Amy.

422
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,950
<15-2,Sheldon>我也是  我们还能以朋友身份相处
<15-2,Sheldon>Me, too. It's comforting to know

423
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,580
<15-2,Sheldon>非常让人欣慰
<15-2,Sheldon>that she and I are able to function as friends.

424
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,770
<15-3,Penny>我跟前任从来当不来朋友
<15-3,Penny>Well, I've never been friends with any of my exes.

425
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,640
<15-4,Sheldon>我肯定你和莱纳德能当朋友
<15-4,Sheldon>Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.

426
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,550
<15-4,Sheldon>是我的朋友艾米
<15-4,Sheldon>Oh. It's my friend Amy.

427
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,330
<15-4,Sheldon>你好
<15-4,Sheldon>Hello.

428
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,460
<15-5,Amy>好啊  谢尔顿
<15-5,Amy>Hi, Sheldon.

429
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,380
<15-5,Amy>我刚从母亲家开车出来
<15-5,Amy>I'm just driving home from my mother's.

430
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,990
<15-6,Sheldon>你席间还愉快吗
<15-6,Sheldon>Did you have a nice time?

431
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,710
<15-7,Amy>愉快
<15-7,Amy>I did. Um...

432
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,180
<15-7,Amy>听着  我很喜欢今早我们一起相处的时光
<15-7,Amy>Listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.

433
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,250
<15-8,Sheldon>不是我一个人的功劳
<15-8,Sheldon>Well, I can't take all the credit.

434
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,090
<15-8,Sheldon>那一条凤尾鱼游错方向的时候也很有趣
<15-8,Sheldon>It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.

436
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,900
<15-8,Sheldon>确实
<15-8,Sheldon>It was.

437
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,130
<15-9,Amy>听着
<15-9,Amy>Uh, listen,

438
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,010
<15-9,Amy>我在考虑
<15-9,Amy>I-I was thinking that, um,

439
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,240
<15-9,Amy>我或许准备好重新做你女友了
<15-9,Amy>maybe I'm ready to be your girlfriend again.

440
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
<15-10,Sheldon>我以为我们只是朋友
<15-10,Sheldon>I thought we were just friends.

441
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
<15-11,Amy>我们是朋友
<15-11,Amy>We are.

442
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,520
<15-11,Amy>但我希望  也许...
<15-11,Amy>But I was hoping, maybe...

443
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,340
<15-12,Sheldon>艾米  我擅长很多事情
<15-12,Sheldon>Amy, I excel at many things,

444
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,560
<15-12,Sheldon>但忘记你并非其中一件事
<15-12,Sheldon>but getting over you wasn't one of them.

445
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,140
<15-12,Sheldon>我还是当你的朋友就好
<15-12,Sheldon>I think I need to just be your friend.

446
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,150
<15-15,Amy>好吧
<15-15,Amy>Okay.

447
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,160
<15-13,Amy>我理解
<15-13,Amy>I understand.

448
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,810
<15-13,Amy>好的
<15-13,Amy>Good.

449
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,680
<15-14,Sheldon>我看了盲鳗产粘液的视频
<15-14,Sheldon>Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus,

450
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,620
<15-14,Sheldon>所以我要把答案改成吃海绵宝宝
<15-14,Sheldon>so I'm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.

451
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,600
<15-15,Amy>好的  当然可以
<15-15,Amy>Okay. Sure.
