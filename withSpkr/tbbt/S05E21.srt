00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,630
<1-1,Howard>我今天收到了一封超牛叉的邮件
<1-1,Howard>So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,340
<1-2,Raj>哥们儿  不是我要泼你冷水
<1-2,Raj>I don't mean to burst your bubble, dude,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,250
<1-2,Raj>但那些阴茎增大丸真心不管用啊
<1-2,Raj>but those penile enlargement pills do not work.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,020
<1-3,Howard>相信我  我懂的
<1-3,Howard>Believe me, I know.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,550
<1-3,Howard>那封邮件是来自史蒂芬·霍金的办公室
<1-3,Howard>The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,790
<1-4,Leonard>-不可能吧  -为啥
<1-4,Leonard>- You're kidding. - Why?

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,100
<1-5,Raj>他要来我们学校讲几周的课
<1-5,Raj>He's coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture,

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,540
<1-6,Howard>所以想找个工程师来帮他
<1-6,Howard>and he's looking for an engineer to help maintain

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,260
<1-6,Howard>维护轮椅上的设备
<1-6,Howard>the equipment on his wheelchair.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,450
<1-6,Howard>太赞了
<1-6,Howard>That's amazing.

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,280
<1-7,Leonard>你就是他的赛车维修员啊
<1-7,Leonard>You'll be like his pit crew.

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,820
<1-7,Leonard>提醒你一下  我可不会
<1-7,Leonard>A word of caution: I would not do

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,220
<1-7,Leonard>在他面前模仿他说话
<1-7,Leonard>your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,420
<1-8,Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice)>你说得对
<1-8,Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice)>You're right.

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,000
<1-8,Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice)>我觉得这么做是挺没礼貌的
<1-8,Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice)>I suppose that could be considered offensive.

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,530
<1-9,Raj>伙计  谢尔顿会疯掉的
<1-9,Raj>Boy, Sheldon's going to freak out.

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,290
<1-10,Leonard>是啊  他特别崇拜霍金
<1-10,Leonard>Yeah, he worships Hawking.

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,960
<1-11,Howard>我其实有考虑带他过去
<1-11,Howard>I was actually thinking about bringing him along

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,530
<1-11,Howard>好让他见见自己的偶像
<1-11,Howard>when I go over there so he can meet the great man.

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,120
<1-12,Raj>你真是个大善人啊  霍华德
<1-12,Raj>That's really nice of you, Howard.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,400
<1-13,Howard>举手之劳啦
<1-13,Howard>It's no big deal.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,930
<1-14,Leonard>天啊  霍金也会去申请一张限制令的吧
<1-14,Leonard>Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking.

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,550
<1-14,Leonard>三人依次为《星际迷航》史波克扮演者、著名天文学家
<1-14,Leonard>美国漫画大师  作品包括《蜘蛛侠》《神奇四侠》等

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,900
<1-14,Leonard>加上莱纳德·尼莫伊  卡尔·萨根
<1-14,Leonard>It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,550
<1-14,Leonard>和斯坦·李对他的限制令  硕果累累呀
<1-14,Leonard>from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,360
<1-15,Sheldon>莱纳德  你还记得有一次我说
<1-15,Sheldon>Leonard, do you recall when I said

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,120
<1-15,Sheldon>我将彻底改变人们对希格斯玻色子的理解
<1-15,Sheldon>that I was going to revolutionize humanity's understanding

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,250
<1-15,Sheldon>然后你说
<1-15,Sheldon>of the Higgs boson particle, and you said,

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,470
<1-15,Sheldon>"谢尔顿  现在是凌晨两点  滚出我的卧室"吗
<1-15,Sheldon>"Sheldon, it's 2:00 a.m., get out of my bedroom"?

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,270
<1-16,Leonard>不就是今天凌晨吗
<1-16,Leonard>Like it was ten hours ago.

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,180
<1-16,Leonard>怎么了
<1-16,Leonard>What about it?

32
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,810
<1-17,Sheldon>我觉得我成功了
<1-17,Sheldon>Well, I believe I've done it.

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
<1-17,Sheldon>我说"我觉得"只是为表谦虚
<1-17,Sheldon>And I'm only saying "believe" to sound modest,

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
<1-17,Sheldon>因为  感谢上帝  我成功了
<1-17,Sheldon>because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.

35
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,520
<1-19,Raj>-真的假的  -太牛了  给
<1-19,Raj>- Really? - That's incredible. Oh, here.

36
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,690
<1-19,Raj>式子列给我们看看
<1-19,Raj>Break out the math.

37
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,120
<1-20,Sheldon>行  我看看
<1-20,Sheldon>Oh, okay, let me see this.

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,450
<1-20,Sheldon>看  这个粒子
<1-20,Sheldon>All right, so this particle here

39
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,060
<1-20,Sheldon>是随时间演化的玻色子
<1-20,Sheldon>is the boson moving forward in time.

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,950
<1-20,Sheldon>我之前考虑的是...
<1-20,Sheldon>Now, I was thinking...

41
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,140
<1-20,Sheldon>霍华德  你就先吃吧
<1-20,Sheldon>Howard, you go ahead and eat.

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,620
<1-20,Sheldon>你肯定一点儿都听不懂
<1-20,Sheldon>This isn't going to make any sense to you.

43
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,920
<1-21,Howard>谢尔顿  我对物理还是懂不少的
<1-21,Howard>Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.

44
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,190
<1-22,Sheldon>是吗  很好  继续努力
<1-22,Sheldon>Yeah, good for you, and don't stop working on it.

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,700
<1-23,Raj>你还打算跟他说
<1-23,Raj>Are you still going to tell him

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,750
<1-23,Raj>-那个人的事吗  -说啊
<1-23,Raj>- about you-know-who? - Yep.

47
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,980
<1-25,Leonard>那你还打算引见他吗
<1-25,Leonard>Are you still going to introduce him?

48
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,510
<1-26,Howard>这辈子都别想了
<1-26,Howard>Not on your life.

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,810
<2-1,Sheldon>求你了  求你了  求你了嘛
<2-1,Sheldon>Please, please, please,

59
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,600
<2-1,Sheldon>让我见见霍金吧
<2-1,Sheldon>let me meet Hawking.

60
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
<2-2,Howard>我都说了不行了
<2-2,Howard>I told you, no.

61
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,310
<2-3,Sheldon>可我都道歉了
<2-3,Sheldon>But I said I'm sorry.

62
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,870
<2-4,Howard>不对  你说的是"要是我道歉  管用吗"
<2-4,Howard>No, you said, "Would it help if I said I'm sorry?"

63
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,580
<2-5,Sheldon>然后你都没回应我
<2-5,Sheldon>And you never answered me.

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,740
<2-5,Sheldon>瞧  现在该道歉的是谁
<2-5,Sheldon>So who owes whom an apology now?

65
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,620
<2-6,Howard>谢尔顿  你是个傲慢的混蛋
<2-6,Howard>Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk.

66
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,120
<2-6,Howard>我干嘛要帮你这种人的忙呀
<2-6,Howard>Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?

68
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,660
<2-7,Sheldon>死后好上犹太天堂吗
<2-7,Sheldon>To go to Jewish heaven?

69
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,450
<2-8,Howard>犹太人没有天堂
<2-8,Howard>Jews don't have heaven.

70
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,560
<2-9,Sheldon>那是为了避免下犹太地狱吗
<2-9,Sheldon>Then to avoid Jewish hell?

71
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,970
<2-10,Howard>你见过我妈吗吧
<2-10,Howard>Have you met my mother?

72
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,410
<2-10,Howard>我不住地狱  谁算住地狱
<2-10,Howard>I live in Jewish hell.

73
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,600
<2-10,Howard>霍华德  求求你了
<2-10,Howard>Howard, please.

74
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,310
<2-11,Sheldon>这可是史蒂芬·霍金啊
<2-11,Sheldon>This is Stephen Hawking.

75
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,640
<2-11,Sheldon>也许是唯一一个智商和我相当的人
<2-11,Sheldon>Perhaps my only intellectual equal.

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,380
<2-12,Howard>你别搞笑了
<2-12,Howard>Oh, you can't be serious.

77
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,850
<2-13,Sheldon>你设身处地地替我想想
<2-13,Sheldon>Try to put yourself in my place.

78
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,290
<2-13,Sheldon>假设你的星球都是狗狗
<2-13,Sheldon>Imagine you're the sole human being

79
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,740
<2-13,Sheldon>而你是唯一一个人类
<2-13,Sheldon>living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs.

80
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,290
<2-13,Sheldon>然后突然发现
<2-13,Sheldon>And then it turns out

81
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,470
<2-13,Sheldon>这星球上还有一个人类
<2-13,Sheldon>there's another human being.

82
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,380
<2-14,Howard>打住
<2-14,Howard>Hang on.

83
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,630
<2-14,Howard>你是说除了你俩  其他人都是狗狗吗
<2-14,Howard>Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?

84
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,170
<2-15,Sheldon>好吧  我就知道你会误解我的意思
<2-15,Sheldon>Okay, I can see you're going to take this the wrong way.

85
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,140
<2-15,Sheldon>我换个说法吧
<2-15,Sheldon>Let me try again.

86
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,850
<2-15,Sheldon>假设你的星球都是大猩猩
<2-15,Sheldon>Imagine you're the sole human being

87
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,160
<2-15,Sheldon>而你是唯一一个人类
<2-15,Sheldon>living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.

88
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,620
<2-16,Howard>滚出去
<2-16,Howard>Get out of my lab.

89
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,980
<2-17,Sheldon>大猩猩比狗狗聪明多了
<2-17,Sheldon>Oh, now they're so much smarter than dogs.

90
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,900
<2-17,Sheldon>你见过它们骑小自行车吗
<2-17,Sheldon>Have you seen them on those little bicycles?

91
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,190
<2-18,Howard>出去
<2-18,Howard>Get out.

92
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,700
<2-19,Sheldon>那换成海豚  好不
<2-19,Sheldon>How about dolphins?

93
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,750
<2-20,Howard>滚
<2-20,Howard>Out!

94
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,840
<3-1,Leonard>说吧  跟霍金度过的第一天感觉如何
<3-1,Leonard>So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,860
<3-2,Howard>超赞的
<3-2,Howard>It was great.

96
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,330
<3-2,Howard>我们聊了电影
<3-2,Howard>We talked about movies...

97
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,190
<3-3,Sheldon>神啊
<3-3,Sheldon>Oh...

98
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,700
<3-4,Howard>我给他变了几个扑克牌魔术
<3-4,Howard>I showed him some card tricks...

99
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,460
<3-3,Sheldon>神啊
<3-3,Sheldon>Oh!

100
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,900
<3-6,Howard>他还让我给他念了几页他的新书
<3-6,Howard>He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.

101
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,680
<3-3,Sheldon>神啊
<3-3,Sheldon>Oh!

102
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,720
<3-8,Howard>什么事让你这么失望呀  亲爱的
<3-8,Howard>Something got you down there, bunky?

103
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,480
<3-9,Sheldon>霍华德  求求你了
<3-9,Sheldon>Howard, please, I'm begging you.

104
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,180
<3-10,Leonard>拉杰  你是咱们这帮人里记性最好的
<3-10,Leonard>Raj, you're our group historian.

105
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,880
<3-10,Leonard>谢尔顿以前求过人吗
<3-10,Leonard>Has Sheldon ever begged before?

106
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,190
<3-11,Raj>求过三次
<3-11,Raj>Three times.

107
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,820
<3-11,Raj>他求过福克斯电视网不要砍掉《萤火虫》
<3-11,Raj>He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly.

108
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,600
<3-11,Raj>他求过TNT电视网砍掉《巴比伦五号》
<3-11,Raj>He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5.

109
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,630
<3-11,Raj>他在玫瑰碗橄榄球赛游行时食物中毒
<3-11,Raj>And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade,

110
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,370
<3-11,Raj>还求过一个他不信奉的神
<3-11,Raj>he begged a deity he doesn't believe in

111
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,980
<3-11,Raj>让他死得痛快
<3-11,Raj>to end his life quickly.

112
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,670
<3-12,Sheldon>你知道霍金对我来说有多重要吗
<3-12,Sheldon>Do you understand how important Hawking is to me?

113
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,640
<3-12,Sheldon>我六岁的时候
<3-12,Sheldon>When I was six years old,

114
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,880
<3-12,Sheldon>万圣节扮的就是他
<3-12,Sheldon>I dressed up as him for Halloween.

115
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,210
<3-13,Howard>开玩笑的吧
<3-13,Howard>You're kidding.

116
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,170
<3-14,Sheldon>绝对没有  我拿了我爸的写字椅
<3-14,Sheldon>No, sir, no, I took my dad's desk chair,

117
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,780
<3-14,Sheldon>装上一个拼说语音学习机
<3-14,Sheldon>attached a Speak & Spell to it

118
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,540
<3-14,Sheldon>然后让我妹妹推我去街上
<3-14,Sheldon>and made my sister push me up and down the block

119
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,910
<3-14,Sheldon>讨糖吃
<3-14,Sheldon>to trick or treat.

121
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,770
<3-14,Sheldon>大部分人都以为我在扮R2-D2
<3-14,Sheldon>Granted most people thought I was R2-D2,

122
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,100
<3-14,Sheldon>但我还是讨到很多糖
<3-14,Sheldon>but still, I got a lot of candy.

123
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,630
<3-15,Howard>你好像不太懂
<3-15,Howard>You don't seem to be understanding

124
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,230
<3-15,Howard>英语的"NO"
<3-15,Howard>the English word "no."

125
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,430
<3-15,Howard>或者换其他语言比较好
<3-15,Howard>Maybe a different language will help.

126
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,600
<3-15,Howard>俄语  Nyet
<3-15,Howard>Russian: nyet.

<3-15,Howard>二进制ASCII码  0110111001101111
<3-15,Howard>Binary coded Ascii:0110111001101111.

<3-16,Sheldon>-应该是01100111  -不行
<3-16,Sheldon>- It's actually 01100111. - No!

132
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,070
<3-18,Sheldon>我不是为自己求你
<3-18,Sheldon>I'm not asking for me,

133
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
<3-18,Sheldon>我是为了霍金求你
<3-18,Sheldon>I'm asking for Hawking.

134
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,550
<3-19,Howard>试试黑帮用语  去你丫的
<3-19,Howard>Let me try gangsta: Hells naw.

135
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,780
<3-20,Sheldon>好吧  要不这样
<3-20,Sheldon>Okay, look, how about this?

136
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,380
<3-20,Sheldon>把我的希格斯粒子论文给他
<3-20,Sheldon>Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson.

137
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,240
<3-20,Sheldon>如果他看出我所做的伟大突破
<3-20,Sheldon>If he sees the incredible breakthrough I've made,

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,630
<3-20,Sheldon>他会主动联系我
<3-20,Sheldon>he'll reach out to me.

139
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,600
<3-21,Leonard>要是他不联系你呢
<3-21,Leonard>What if he doesn't?

140
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,500
<3-22,Sheldon>他会的  他可聪明了
<3-22,Sheldon>He will; he's really smart.

141
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,760
<3-23,Howard>这个主意有意思
<3-23,Howard>That's an interesting idea.

142
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,380
<3-23,Howard>要不你给我几分钟
<3-23,Howard>Why don't you give me a minute

143
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,110
<3-23,Howard>让我跟我的朋友商量一下
<3-23,Howard>to talk it over with my friends?

144
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,410
<3-24,Sheldon>-我要怎么做  -赶紧消失
<3-24,Sheldon>- How do I do that? - You walk away.

145
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,400
<3-26,Sheldon>我这就闪
<3-26,Sheldon>Walking away.

146
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,990
<3-27,Leonard>你要知道  你现在就是他的老大
<3-27,Leonard>You do realize you own his ass right now.

147
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,170
<3-28,Howard>我知道
<3-28,Howard>I do.

148
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,200
<3-29,Raj>你可以把他当狗使唤
<3-29,Raj>You can make him do anything you want.

149
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,680
<3-30,Howard>我知道  我只是在想
<3-30,Howard>Yeah, I know, I'm just trying to figure out

150
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,910
<3-30,Howard>我要把他整得多惨
<3-30,Howard>how much I want to punish him.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,660
<3-31,Raj>别太过分  意思一下
<3-31,Raj>Well, don't be too mean.

152
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,480
<3-32,Sheldon>伙计们
<3-32,Sheldon>Hey, fellas,

153
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,840
<3-32,Sheldon>我想泡点清新冰茶
<3-32,Sheldon>I'm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea

154
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,960
<3-32,Sheldon>有谁想喝呀
<3-32,Sheldon>if anyone would like some.

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,180
<3-33,Raj>我不介意来一杯
<3-33,Raj>I wouldn't mind a glass.

156
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,100
<3-34,Sheldon>我没跟你说话
<3-34,Sheldon>I wasn't talking to you.

157
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,960
<3-35,Raj>整到他求爷爷告奶奶
<3-35,Raj>Bring him to his bony knees.

158
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,650
<3-36,Howard>小谢子  回来吧
<3-36,Howard>Sheldon, come on back.

159
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,760
<3-37,Sheldon>来了  来了
<3-37,Sheldon>Yes, yes.

160
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,460
<3-37,Sheldon>您意下如何
<3-37,Sheldon>What did you decide?

161
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,530
<3-38,Howard>我可以把你的论文给霍金教授
<3-38,Howard>I'll give your paper to Professor Hawking.

162
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,500
<3-39,Sheldon>太好了  谢谢
<3-39,Sheldon>Great, thank you!

163
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,690
<3-39,Sheldon>真是太好了
<3-39,Sheldon>Oh, that's terrific!

164
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,870
<3-40,Howard>但是  你要为我做几件事作为交换
<3-40,Howard>But in exchange, I'd like you to do a few things for me.

165
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,610
<3-41,Sheldon>什么事
<3-41,Sheldon>What kinds of things?

166
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,200
<3-41,Sheldon>希腊神话中  赫拉因错杀自己孩子而受诅咒
<3-41,Sheldon>为消除罪业  他要为敌人完成十二项任务

167
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,200
<3-42,Howard>你听说过赫拉克勒斯的十二伟业吗
<3-42,Howard>Are you familiar with the 12 labors of Hercules?

168
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,450
<3-43,Sheldon>当然
<3-43,Sheldon>Of course.

169
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,790
<3-44,Howard>那你走运了
<3-44,Howard>You should be so lucky.

170
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,720
<4-1,Sheldon>好了
<4-1,Sheldon>All right.

171
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,360
<4-1,Sheldon>你要我先做什么
<4-1,Sheldon>What would you like me to do first?

172
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,330
<4-2,Howard>我觉得我就先让你
<4-2,Howard>Well, I thought I'd start you off

173
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,360
<4-2,Howard>给我擦皮带扣吧
<4-2,Howard>by polishing my belt buckles.

174
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,550
<4-3,Sheldon>没问题
<4-3,Sheldon>By all means.

175
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,020
<4-3,Sheldon>小时候  我会帮我奶奶擦银器
<4-3,Sheldon>When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver.

176
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,140
<4-3,Sheldon>她就会给我讲
<4-3,Sheldon>And she would entertain me with stories

177
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,740
<4-3,Sheldon>她在俄州长大的故事
<4-3,Sheldon>about growing up in Oklahoma.

178
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,040
<4-3,Sheldon>有趣的女人
<4-3,Sheldon>Interesting woman.

179
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,330
<4-3,Sheldon>有一次  她用肉汁盘子打死了一只土拨鼠
<4-3,Sheldon>She once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.

180
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,420
<4-4,Howard>真厉害
<4-4,Howard>That's nice.

181
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,880
<4-5,Sheldon>好多皮带扣啊
<4-5,Sheldon>That's a lot of belt buckles.

182
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,200
<4-6,Howard>有趣的是  我只有一条皮带
<4-6,Howard>Funny thing is,I only have one belt.

183
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,230
<4-6,Howard>好了  我不妨碍你开工了
<4-6,Howard>Anyway, I'll let you get started.

184
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,240
<4-6,Howard>顺便说一下
<4-6,Howard>Oh, by the way,

185
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
<4-6,Howard>上面可能有些看似水渍的点
<4-6,Howard>the little marks, uh,that look like water spots--

186
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,660
<4-6,Howard>我小便时习惯靠便盆太近  所以
<4-6,Howard>I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so...

187
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,610
<4-6,Howard>你看到的那些是溅回来的
<4-6,Howard>...what you're seeing there is splash back.

188
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,180
<4-7,Sheldon>你把尿尿在皮带扣上吗
<4-7,Sheldon>You make sissy on your belt buckles?

189
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,110
<4-7,Sheldon>奶奶的叉子上绝对没有
<4-7,Sheldon>Mee-Maw's forks never had that.

190
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,120
<4-8,Howard>给你个紫外光灯照尿渍吧
<4-8,Howard>Here is a black light to check them.

191
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,380
<4-8,Howard>再给你提个醒
<4-8,Howard>And for your own peace of mind,

193
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,800
<4-8,Howard>最好不要用它来照我的房间哦
<4-8,Howard>you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.

194
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,340
<4-9,Howard>谢尔顿  擦得好干净啊
<4-9,Howard>Sheldon, these look great.

195
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,040
<4-9,Howard>它们就像华丽的小皇冠
<4-9,Howard>They're like magnificent little crowns

196
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,080
<4-9,Howard>挂在我坚挺的小宝贝上
<4-9,Howard>to hang over my magnificent little jewels.

197
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,600
<4-9,Howard>你怎么擦得这么亮
<4-9,Howard>How'd you get them so shiny?

198
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,470
<4-10,Sheldon>我给它们上了一层防水蜡
<4-10,Sheldon>Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax.

199
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,540
<4-10,Sheldon>汽车用品店里的伙计说
<4-10,Sheldon>The man down at Pep Boys says from now on,

200
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,330
<4-10,Sheldon>以后溅上去的尿液会直接流下去
<4-10,Sheldon>the urine should just bead up and roll right off.

201
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,750
<4-11,Howard>干得漂亮
<4-11,Howard>Way to go the extra mile.

202
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,260
<4-11,Howard>你奶奶会骄傲的
<4-11,Howard>Your Mee-Maw would be proud.

203
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,230
<4-12,Sheldon>我奶奶绝对不可以知道这件事
<4-12,Sheldon>My Mee-Maw must never know of this.

204
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,160
<4-12,Sheldon>现在能把我的论文给霍金教授看了吧
<4-12,Sheldon>Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?

205
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,660
<4-13,Howard>小乖乖  当然不可以
<4-13,Howard>Oh, my dear boy, no.

206
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,850
<4-13,Howard>好了
<4-13,Howard>Okay.

207
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
<4-13,Howard>接下来
<4-13,Howard>Next,

208
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,140
<4-13,Howard>这是我买给伯纳黛特的
<4-13,Howard>this is a sexy French maid costume

209
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,400
<4-13,Howard>性感法国女佣装
<4-13,Howard>I bought for Bernadette.

210
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,180
<4-13,Howard>我原以为这既能增加情趣
<4-13,Howard>I thought it might spice things up

211
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,450
<4-13,Howard>又能让她帮我打扫房间
<4-13,Howard>and get her to dust my room at the same time,

212
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,120
<4-13,Howard>可我错了  大错特错
<4-13,Howard>but I was wrong and really wrong.

213
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,780
<4-14,Sheldon>所以你想让我把它退回去吗
<4-14,Sheldon>And you want me to return it for you?

214
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,710
<4-15,Howard>不  不  不  我的小可爱[法语]
<4-15,Howard>No, no, no, mon petit cherie.

215
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,190
<5-1,Sheldon>你们看什么看
<5-1,Sheldon>What are you all staring at?

216
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,760
<5-1,Sheldon>没见过为了见斯蒂芬·霍金
<5-1,Sheldon>You ever seen a man try to get a meeting

217
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,890
<5-1,Sheldon>牺牲色相的男人吗
<5-1,Sheldon>with Stephen Hawking before?

218
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,430
<6-2,Sheldon>今天不是周六呀
<6-2,Sheldon>It's not Saturday night.

219
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,320
<6-3,Penny>你怎么跑来洗衣服了
<6-3,Penny>Why are you doing your laundry?

220
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,160
<6-4,Sheldon>这不是我的衣服
<6-4,Sheldon>This is not my laundry.

221
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,910
<6-5,Penny>这是艾米的吗
<6-5,Penny>Wow, are these Amy's?

222
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,330
<6-5,Penny>挺狂野的  不错不错
<6-5,Penny>Kind of trashy -- good for her.

223
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,510
<6-6,Sheldon>那是霍华德的
<6-6,Sheldon>Those are Howard's.

224
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,950
<6-7,Penny>你为什么要替霍华德
<6-7,Penny>Why are you washing

225
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,410
<6-7,Penny>洗他的男士小内内呢
<6-7,Penny>Howard's man panties?

226
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,460
<6-8,Sheldon>因为要是我不洗的话
<6-8,Sheldon>Because if I don't,

227
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,320
<6-8,Sheldon>他就不把我的论文拿给斯蒂芬·霍金看
<6-8,Sheldon>he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking.

228
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,060
<6-8,Sheldon>斯蒂芬·霍金是个著名的物理学家
<6-8,Sheldon>He's a famous physicist.

229
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,950
<6-9,Penny>我知道  那个坐着轮椅发明了时间的家伙
<6-9,Penny>I know, he's the wheelchair dude who invented time.

230
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,030
<6-10,Sheldon>差不多吧
<6-10,Sheldon>That's close enough.

231
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,610
<6-11,Penny>我不懂
<6-11,Penny>I don't understand,

232
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,900
<6-11,Penny>为什么霍华德不直接把你介绍给那人呢
<6-11,Penny>why doesn't Howard just introduce you to the guy?

233
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,280
<6-12,Sheldon>他要惩罚我这个"傲慢的混蛋"
<6-12,Sheldon>Because he's punishing me for being a "condescending jerk".

234
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,980
<6-12,Sheldon>你不会也觉得我傲慢吧
<6-12,Sheldon>You don't think I'm condescending, do you?

235
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,440
<6-13,Penny>有点吧
<6-13,Penny>Well, kind of...

236
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,710
<6-14,Sheldon>抱歉  "傲慢"的意思是...
<6-14,Sheldon>Oh, I'm sorry,condescending means...

237
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,750
<6-15,Penny>我懂好不好
<6-15,Penny>I know what it means.

238
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,740
<6-15,Penny>没错  你超喜欢纠正别人
<6-15,Penny>And yes, you love correcting people

239
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,950
<6-15,Penny>让人自惭形秽
<6-15,Penny>and putting them down.

240
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,190
<6-16,Sheldon>正相反
<6-16,Sheldon>Au contraire.

241
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,320
<6-16,Sheldon>当我纠正别人时  我是让他们更进一步
<6-16,Sheldon>When I correct people I am raising them up.

242
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,650
<6-16,Sheldon>你应该最懂了  你可是深得我恩惠
<6-16,Sheldon>You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.

243
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,130
<6-17,Penny>拜托  你只是给自己带来优越感
<6-17,Penny>Come on, you do it to feel superior.

244
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,330
<6-17,Penny>每次有人犯语法错误
<6-17,Penny>I see that twinkle in your eye

245
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,600
<6-17,Penny>或是把月亮当作行星时
<6-17,Penny>when someone says "who" instead of "whom"

246
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
<6-17,Penny>我都能看到你两眼放光
<6-17,Penny>or thinks the moon is a planet.

248
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,910
<6-18,Sheldon>或是有人以为《堂·吉诃德》是在写驴子诃德
<6-18,Sheldon>Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.

249
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,010
<6-19,Penny>看见没
<6-19,Penny>See, there it is,

250
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,660
<6-19,Penny>你两眼又放光了
<6-19,Penny>there's that twinkle.

251
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,220
<6-20,Sheldon>没办法  我完全是下意识两眼放光
<6-20,Sheldon>Well, I can't help it. That's an involuntary twinkle.

252
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,870
<6-21,Penny>那你想我怎么说  谢尔顿
<6-21,Penny>What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?

253
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,010
<6-22,Sheldon>我想听你说
<6-22,Sheldon>I want you to tell me

254
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,490
<6-22,Sheldon>霍华德就是想无故欺负我
<6-22,Sheldon>that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.

255
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,890
<6-23,Penny>好吧  霍华德就是想无故欺负你
<6-23,Penny>Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.

256
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,490
<6-24,Sheldon>我就知道
<6-24,Sheldon>I knew it.

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
<7-1,Howard>怎么了
<7-1,Howard>What's the matter?

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
<7-2,Bernadette>我每次在你家过夜
<7-2,Bernadette>Every time I spend the night,

259
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,910
<7-2,Bernadette>你妈都会拍我屁股  说"妹子  上吧"
<7-2,Bernadette>your mom slaps me on the behind says, "Go get 'em."

260
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,780
<7-3,Howard>这不能怪她
<7-3,Howard>It's not her fault.

261
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,450
<7-3,Howard>她正在接受激素替代疗法
<7-3,Howard>She's getting hormone replacement therapy.

262
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,980
<7-3,Howard>导致她相当饥渴
<7-3,Howard>Makes her crazy horny.

263
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,470
<7-3,Howard>看  我让谢尔顿穿那套法国女佣装哦
<7-3,Howard>Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the Frenchmaid's costume.

264
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,510
<7-4,Bernadette>天啊  这也太过分了吧
<7-4,Bernadette>Oh, my God, that's terrible.

265
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,890
<7-5,Howard>拜托  是你穿过一次说不要的
<7-5,Howard>Hey, I gave you first crack at it.

266
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,360
<7-6,Bernadette>你为什么要这么做
<7-6,Bernadette>Why are you doing that?

267
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,740
<7-6,Bernadette>你这是在欺负他
<7-6,Bernadette>You're being mean to him.

268
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,330
<7-7,Howard>是他整天欺负我
<7-7,Howard>He's mean to me all the time.

269
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,970
<7-7,Howard>你也见过他取笑我没有博士学位
<7-7,Howard>You've heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.

270
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,410
<7-8,Bernadette>如果你不想没博士学位被人取笑
<7-8,Bernadette>If you don't want to get teased about that,

271
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,890
<7-8,Bernadette>那就去考一个呀
<7-8,Bernadette>get a doctorate.

272
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,270
<7-8,Bernadette>我有一个  感觉超棒呢
<7-8,Bernadette>I have one; they're great.

273
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,810
<7-9,Howard>拜托  这个家伙一直在折磨我
<7-9,Howard>Oh, come on, the man torments me.

274
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,520
<7-9,Howard>我只不过用其人之道还治其人之身而已
<7-9,Howard>I'm just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.

275
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,120
<7-10,Bernadette>这不一样
<7-10,Bernadette>It's not the same thing.

276
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
<7-10,Bernadette>谢尔顿意识不到自己的刻薄
<7-10,Bernadette>Sheldon doesn't know when he's being mean

277
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,620
<7-10,Bernadette>因为他控制这部分情感的大脑
<7-10,Bernadette>because the part of his brain that should know

278
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,370
<7-10,Bernadette>被大脑其它部分给挤扁了
<7-10,Bernadette>is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.

279
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,540
<7-11,Howard>好吧  我让他再多干几件事
<7-11,Howard>Fine, I'll just make him do a couple more things,

280
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,680
<7-11,Howard>就收手
<7-11,Howard>then I'll stop.

281
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,620
<7-12,Bernadette>不  你现在就得收手
<7-12,Bernadette>No, you have to stop now.

282
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,580
<7-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>伯纳黛特  提醒你一下
<7-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Bernadette, I want to remind you,

283
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,440
<7-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>你答应过明天陪我去买裙子的哦
<7-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!

284
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,290
<7-14,Bernadette>该死
<7-14,Bernadette>Oh, damn.

285
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,890
<7-14,Bernadette>对不起  我明天有事去不了了
<7-14,Bernadette>I'm sorry, I can't make it,

286
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,330
<7-14,Bernadette>但是谢尔顿会陪你去的
<7-14,Bernadette>but Sheldon's going to go with you!

287
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,030
<7-14,Bernadette>这是你让他做的最后一件事了
<7-14,Bernadette>And that's the last thing you do to him.

288
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,010
<7-14,Bernadette>谢尔顿
<7-14,Bernadette>Sheldon!

289
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,870
<8-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>帮我一下
<8-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I need your help!

290
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,390
<8-2,Sheldon>又怎么了  沃罗威茨太太
<8-2,Sheldon>What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?

291
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,870
<8-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>这裙子有问题
<8-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>It's this dress!

292
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,680
<8-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我把胸塞进去  屁股就露出来了
<8-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>When I put my front in, my back pops out!

293
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,510
<8-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我把屁股塞进去  胸就又露出来了
<8-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>When I put my back in,my front pops out!

294
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,490
<8-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>简直是一山容不下二虎呀
<8-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>It's like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!

295
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,190
<8-4,Sheldon>你想让我做什么
<8-4,Sheldon>What do you want me to do?

296
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,750
<8-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我们应该携手合作
<8-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>We're gonna have to work as a team!

297
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,640
<8-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>进来  大把抓着  动手塞啊
<8-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Get in here, grab a handful,and start stuffing!

298
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,820
<8-6,Sheldon (off)>我不太确定该怎么做呢
<8-6,Sheldon (off)>I'm not sure how to do this.

299
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,180
<8-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>很简单  就像把用完的睡袋给塞回去
<8-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>It's easy, just pretend you're putting away a sleeping bag.

300
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,470
<8-8,Sheldon (off)>睡袋不会出这么多汗  不过好吧
<8-8,Sheldon (off)>Sleeping bags don't usually sweat this much, but okay.

301
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,780
<8-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>帮我拉上拉链
<8-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Now zip me up.

302
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,460
<8-10,Sheldon (off)>再继续挤下去
<8-10,Sheldon (off)>Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter,

304
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,340
<8-10,Sheldon (off)>你就能变成钻石了
<8-10,Sheldon (off)>you may turn into a diamond.

305
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,710
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>你说得对  我骗谁呢
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>You're right, who am I kidding?

306
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,940
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>你真该见见我年轻的时候  谢尔顿
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon.

307
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,100
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>追我的小伙们
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>The fellas used to line up

308
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,640
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>排着队给我送糖
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>and bring me boxes of candy.

309
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,910
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我干嘛嘴贱全吃光啊
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Why did I eat it all?!

310
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,010
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>可以抱我一下吗
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Would you hold me?

311
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,350
<8-12,Sheldon>我  我不是那种会抱别人的...
<8-12,Sheldon>Oh... no, you know, I'm not really the holding kind of...

312
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,190
<9-1,Howard>哦  差点忘了
<9-1,Howard>Oh, guys, I just remembered.

313
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,590
<9-1,Howard>我给你们带了几个霍金纪念品
<9-1,Howard>I got your ome Hawking souvenirs.

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,860
<9-2,Leonard>是什么
<9-2,Leonard>What are these?

315
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,960
<9-3,Howard>他轮椅上的齿轮和弹簧
<9-3,Howard>Gears and springs from his wheelchair.

316
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,230
<9-3,Howard>酷吧
<9-3,Howard>Pretty cool, huh?

317
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,850
<9-4,Raj>太棒了
<9-4,Raj>Wow, that's amazing.

318
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,270
<9-5,Howard>我给他的轮椅制动机做了调整
<9-5,Howard>I made an adjustment on the motor drive

319
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,470
<9-5,Howard>之后要装回去时
<9-5,Howard>and when I was putting it back together

320
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,590
<9-5,Howard>却想不起这几个零件是装哪的了
<9-5,Howard>I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.

321
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,310
<9-5,Howard>我做到了
<9-5,Howard>I did it.

322
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,620
<9-6,Sheldon>跑了整整三个服装店
<9-6,Sheldon>Had to go to three clothing stores,

323
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,470
<9-6,Sheldon>总算找到一件能"装"进你妈的衣服了
<9-6,Sheldon>but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.

324
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,420
<9-7,Howard>我应该提醒你
<9-7,Howard>I should have sent you

325
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,060
<9-7,Howard>去阿尔塔迪纳的特制车罩店去买的
<9-7,Howard>to the custom car cover place in Altadena.

326
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,170
<9-7,Howard>他们有我妈的资料
<9-7,Howard>They have her pattern on file.

327
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,650
<9-8,Sheldon>真幽默
<9-8,Sheldon>Humorous.

328
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,540
<9-8,Sheldon>现在能把我的论文给霍金教授看了吧
<9-8,Sheldon>Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?

329
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,560
<10-2,Hawking>我不知道
<10-2,Hawking>I don't know.

330
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,940
<9-10,Sheldon>老天啊
<9-10,Sheldon>Oh, for heaven's sake.

331
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,630
<9-10,Sheldon>衣服帮你洗了  你的皮带扣还上了防尿层
<9-10,Sheldon>I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles,

332
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,460
<9-10,Sheldon>我为了帮你妈抬高胸部
<9-10,Sheldon>I, I even sprained my wrist

333
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,440
<9-10,Sheldon>我还把手腕扭伤了
<9-10,Sheldon>helping your mother lift her bosom.

334
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,850
<9-11,Howard>好了  谢尔顿
<9-11,Howard>All right, Sheldon,

335
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,390
<9-11,Howard>你再帮我做最后一个任务
<9-11,Howard>there's only one thing left I want you to do.

336
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,090
<9-11,Howard>别担心  这个超简单
<9-11,Howard>Don't worry, it's an easy one.

337
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,460
<9-12,Sheldon>好吧
<9-12,Sheldon>Okay.

338
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,630
<9-13,Howard>夸夸我
<9-13,Howard>Give me a compliment.

339
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,590
<9-14,Sheldon>好吧
<9-14,Sheldon>Fine.

340
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,560
<9-14,Sheldon>你的手超小
<9-14,Sheldon>You have very tiny hands.

341
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,330
<9-15,Howard>不  是夸我的工作
<9-15,Howard>No... about my job.

342
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,930
<9-15,Howard>夸我工作干得出色
<9-15,Howard>I want you to tell me I'm good at what I do.

343
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,420
<9-16,Sheldon>你明显干得很出色啊
<9-16,Sheldon>You're obviously good at what you do.

344
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,380
<9-17,Howard>那你为什么老是挖苦我
<9-17,Howard>Well, then why are you always ripping on me?

345
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,550
<9-18,Sheldon>我理解你的困惑
<9-18,Sheldon>Oh, I understand the confusion.

346
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,650
<9-18,Sheldon>我从未说过你工作不称职
<9-18,Sheldon>I have never said that you are not good at what you do.

347
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,390
<9-18,Sheldon>我是说你的工作没价值
<9-18,Sheldon>It's just that what you do is not worth doing.

348
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,060
<9-19,Leonard>这话可比他对我说的好听多了
<9-19,Leonard>It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me.

349
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,500
<9-19,Leonard>要我一定会接受
<9-19,Leonard>I'd take it and run.

350
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,160
<9-20,Howard>谢谢你  谢尔顿
<9-20,Howard>Thank you, Sheldon.

351
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,320
<9-21,Sheldon>现在能把我的论文给霍金看了吧
<9-21,Sheldon>Now will you give my paper to Hawking?

352
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,570
<9-22,Howard>抱歉  不能
<9-22,Howard>Sorry, I can't.

353
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,640
<9-23,Sheldon>什么  为什么
<9-23,Sheldon>What, why not?

354
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,840
<9-24,Howard>我三天前就给他了
<9-24,Howard>I gave it to him three days ago.

355
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,140
<9-24,Howard>他说了那论文很棒
<9-24,Howard>He was really impressed.

356
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,820
<9-24,Howard>他想见你
<9-24,Howard>He wants to meet you.

357
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,140
<9-25,Sheldon>那好吧
<9-25,Sheldon>All right, then.

358

<9-25,Sheldon>谢谢你  霍华德
<9-25,Sheldon>Thank you, Howard.

359
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,460
<9-25,Sheldon>请你转告霍金教授
<9-25,Sheldon>Please let Professor Hawking know

360
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,290
<9-25,Sheldon>他什么时间想见我  我都有空
<9-25,Sheldon>that I'm available at his earliest convenience.

361
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,160
<9-26,Raj>我还以为他会更兴奋呢
<9-26,Raj>I thought he might be a little more excited.

362
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
<9-27,Leonard>稍安勿躁
<9-27,Leonard>Give it a second.

363
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,470
<9-27,Leonard>霍金教授
<9-27,Leonard>Professor Hawking,

364

<10-1,Sheldon>能见到您真是太荣幸了  先生
<10-1,Sheldon>it's an honor and a privilege to meet you, sir.

365
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,180
<10-2,Hawking>我知道
<10-2,Hawking>I know.

366
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,040
<10-3,Sheldon>感谢您抽出时间见我
<10-3,Sheldon>I want to thank you for taking time to see me.

367
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,800
<10-4,Hawking>我的荣幸
<10-4,Hawking>My pleasure.

368
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,920
<10-4,Hawking>我很喜欢你的论文
<10-4,Hawking>I enjoyed reading your paper very much.

369
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,810
<10-4,Hawking>你的确是聪明绝顶
<10-4,Hawking>You clearly have a brilliant mind.

370
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,150
<10-5,Sheldon>我知道
<10-5,Sheldon>I know.

371
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,250
<10-6,Hawking>你那关于希格斯玻色子是个黑洞
<10-6,Hawking>Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole

372
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,570
<10-6,Hawking>且能加速时间反演的理论很厉害
<10-6,Hawking>accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.

373
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,070
<10-6,Hawking>谢谢
<10-6,Hawking>Thank you.

374
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,560
<10-7,Sheldon>是我有天早上洗澡时突然想到的
<10-7,Sheldon>It just-- it came to me one morning in the shower.

375
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,220
<10-7,Sheldon>挺好啊
<10-7,Sheldon>That's nice.

376
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,380
<10-8,Hawking>可惜是错误的
<10-8,Hawking>Too bad it's wrong.

377
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,720
<10-9,Sheldon>你什么意思
<10-9,Sheldon>What do you mean wrong?

378
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,820
<10-10,Hawking>第二页上有地方运算错误了
<10-10,Hawking>You made an arithmetic mistake on page two.

379
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,000
<10-10,Hawking>愚蠢的错误
<10-10,Hawking>It was quite the boner.

380
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,430
<10-11,Sheldon>不  那不可能
<10-11,Sheldon>No, no... that can't be right.

381
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,790
<10-11,Sheldon>我不可能会运算错误啊
<10-11,Sheldon>I-I don't make arithmetic mistakes.

382
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,790
<10-12,Hawking>那你是说我有吗
<10-12,Hawking>Are you saying I do?

383
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,720
<10-12,Hawking>不是
<10-12,Hawking>Oh, no,

384
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,150
<10-13,Sheldon>当然不是
<10-13,Sheldon>no, no, of course not.

385
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,510
<10-13,Sheldon>我只是在想
<10-13,Sheldon>It's just, I was thinking...

386
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,270
<10-13,Sheldon>天哪  我真的错了
<10-13,Sheldon>Oh, gosh, golly,I made a boo-boo,

387
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,960
<10-13,Sheldon>我还把它呈给了史蒂芬·霍金
<10-13,Sheldon>and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.

388
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,340
<10-14,Hawking>老天  又一个晕倒粉
<10-14,Hawking>Great, another fainter.
