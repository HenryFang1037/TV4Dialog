1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,870
<1-1,Leonard>真不知道我这些年来
<1-1,Leonard>I don't know why I avoided

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,270
<1-1,Leonard>为什么不看哈利波特系列小说
<1-1,Leonard>the Harry Potter books for so long.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,550
<1-1,Leonard>写得很不错啊
<1-1,Leonard>These are great.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,170
<1-1,Leonard>我刚开始看第六册
<1-1,Leonard>I just started number six.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,720
<1-2,Sheldon>那本挺好看的
<1-2,Sheldon>That's a good one.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,660
<1-2,Sheldon>邓布利多在这一本里死了
<1-2,Sheldon>Dumbledore dies in that one.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,150
<1-2,Sheldon>我懂你的感觉  我当初也没料到
<1-2,Sheldon>Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,570
<1-3,Leonard>你干嘛说出来啊
<1-3,Leonard>Why would you say that?

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,830
<1-4,Sheldon>你开始了一个话题
<1-4,Sheldon>You brought up the subject.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,290
<1-4,Sheldon>然后我回以与话题有关的有趣讯息
<1-4,Sheldon>I contributed an interesting fact on that subject.

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,530
<1-4,Sheldon>这就叫聊天的艺术啊
<1-4,Sheldon>It's called the art of conversation.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,190
<1-4,Sheldon>换你说了
<1-4,Sheldon>Okay, your turn.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,400
<1-5,Leonard>你这是超级大剧透啊
<1-5,Leonard>That was a huge spoiler.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,130
<1-6,Sheldon>灰常好
<1-6,Sheldon>Good.

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,710
<1-7,Leonard>你这人有病啊
<1-7,Leonard>What is wrong with you?

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,980
<1-7,Leonard>换做是我剧透  你肯定会叽歪一整周
<1-7,Leonard>If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,160
<1-8,Sheldon>不是吧  莱纳德
<1-8,Sheldon>Oh, really, Leonard?

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,270
<1-8,Sheldon>你的小暴脾气又要发作了吗
<1-8,Sheldon>Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,160
<1-9,Leonard>小暴脾气  我有小暴脾气吗
<1-9,Leonard>Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,790
<1-10,Sheldon>没错  而且我还得出个推论
<1-10,Sheldon>Yes, and I have a theory why.

21
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,320
<1-10,Sheldon>因为你的乳糖不耐症
<1-10,Sheldon>Because of your lactose intolerance,

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,040
<1-10,Sheldon>所以你用豆奶替代牛奶
<1-10,Sheldon>you switched over to soy milk.

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,670
<1-10,Sheldon>而大豆含有类雌激素的化合物
<1-10,Sheldon>Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds.

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,950
<1-10,Sheldon>你的可可球加豆奶早餐
<1-10,Sheldon>I think your morning Cocoa Puffs

<1-11,Leonard>我干嘛要这么忍你
<1-11,Leonard>I don't know why I put up with you.

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,100
<1-11,Leonard>又是控制狂  又超级欠扁
<1-11,Leonard>You're controlling, you're irritating...

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,270
<1-12,Sheldon>又开始叽叽歪歪了  叽叽  歪歪  叽歪
<1-12,Sheldon>There you go again-- nag, nag, nag.

30
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,400
<1-12,Sheldon>越叽歪越显得我说得对哦  小三八
<1-12,Sheldon>You're only proving my point, little lady.

<1-13,Leonard>You know what? Screw you, Sheldon.

<1-13,Leonard>你是我这辈子见过最烦人的人了
<1-13,Leonard>You are the most annoying person I have ever met.

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,170
<1-13,Leonard>什么  我哪里烦人了
<1-13,Leonard>What? I'm annoying?

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,440
<1-14,Sheldon>明明是你整天对我的言行意见超多
<1-14,Sheldon>You criticize my behavior all the time.

35
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,530
<1-14,Sheldon>"谢尔顿  吃早饭时别提你排便的事"
<1-14,Sheldon>"Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast."

36
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,460
<1-14,Sheldon>"谢尔顿  我们大学校长
<1-14,Sheldon>"Sheldon, when the president of the university

37
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,010
<1-14,Sheldon>在丧礼上念悼词时

38
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,550

<1-14,Sheldon>don't yawn and point at your watch."

39
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,510
<1-14,Sheldon>"谢尔顿  不要觉得我衣服难看
<1-14,Sheldon>"Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts

00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,680
<1-14,Sheldon>就把它们拿去丢了"
<1-14,Sheldon>'cause you think they're ugly."

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,180
<1-14,Sheldon>你才难搞好吗
<1-14,Sheldon>You're impossible.

42
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,910
<1-15,Leonard>够了  我没必要...
<1-15,Leonard>That's it. I don't...

43
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,100
<1-15,Leonard>我没必要忍这些极品事
<1-15,Leonard>I don't have to put up with this.

44
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,550
<1-16,Sheldon>事实上  从你在室友协议上签名的那天起
<1-16,Sheldon>Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement

<2-3,Raj>连句谢谢都不说吗
<2-3,Raj>What, you don't say thank you?

63
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,240
<2-4,Howard>这本来就是我的
<2-4,Howard>It's my suitcase.

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
<2-4,Howard>我两年前借给你的

<2-6,Howard>-这是她公司的额外奖励啦  -不错
<2-6,Howard>- It's part of a bonus she got. - Cool.

71
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,580
<2-7,Raj>她是研发出某种疾病的解药之类的吗
<2-7,Raj>Did she discover a cure for something?

72
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,670
<2-8,Howard>不算是啦

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,770
<2-9,Raj>难道拉稀还能是好事吗
<2-9,Raj>Is there a good anal leakage?

76
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,820
<2-10,Howard>反正是妮妮的主意
<2-10,Howard>Anyway, it was Bernie's idea

77
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,750
<2-10,Howard>让公司把这药物当成治便秘的药物销售
<2-10,Howard>to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.

<3-2,Penny>You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.

118
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,580
<3-2,Penny>《芝麻街》是美国家喻户晓的儿童教育节目
<3-2,Penny>教授基础阅读算术 颜色的名称 字母和数字等基本知识

119
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,090

<3-3,Leonard>我连跟他同住多一分钟都忍不了
<3-3,Leonard>I can't... I can't live with him for one more minute.

121
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,210
<3-4,Penny>那你打算去哪里住
<3-4,Penny>Where are you going to go?

<3-8,Penny>真没  这样很好啊
<3-8,Penny>No, it's-it's great.

126
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,750
<3-8,Penny>简直太棒了
<3-8,Penny>It's terrific. I...

127
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,970
<3-8,Penny>我只是忍不住替谢尔顿难过而已
<3-8,Penny>You know, I just can't help feel bad about Sheldon.

128
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,820
<3-8,Penny>我是觉得...
<3-8,Penny>I mean...

129
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,900
<3-8,Penny>他没有你怎么活啊
<3-8,Penny>how's he going to get by without you?

<3-10,Penny>的确  但不一样的啦
<3-10,Penny>Yeah, he does, but it's not the same.

133
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,790
<3-11,Leonard>为什么
<3-11,Leonard>Why?

134
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,380
<3-12,Penny>好吧  这么说吧
<3-12,Penny>Well, um, all right.

135
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,720
<3-12,Penny>在《哈利·波特与混血王子》[第六册]中
<3-12,Penny>You-you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,

<3-12,Penny>Ron didn't abandon Harry just because Harry started

137
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,800
<3-12,Penny>而抛弃哈利啊
<3-12,Penny>dating Ron's sister?

138
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,500
<3-13,Leonard>哈利和金妮在一起了啊

<3-14,Penny>Sorry. Spoiler alert.

140
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,660
<3-14,Penny>我的重点是  尽管我很想跟你住在一起
<3-14,Penny>My point is, as much as I want to live with you,

141
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,360
<3-14,Penny>但谢尔顿需要你  我不能这么自私
<3-14,Penny>I can't do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.

142
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,200
<3-15,Leonard>拜托  他唯一需要我的地方是
<3-15,Leonard>Please, the only thing he needs me for

143
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,770
<3-15,Leonard>当他的替罪羔羊

<3-15,Leonard>他的傀儡和出气筒
<3-15,Leonard>his-his stooge, his doormat.

145
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,420
<3-16,Penny>人家不是都说 "不要没事找事嘛"
<3-16,Penny>Well, you know what they say: if it ain't broke...

146
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,660
<3-16,Penny>源自谚语"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
<3-16,Penny>意思是不要随便改变现状  小心弄巧成拙

147
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,370
<3-17,Leonard>听起来似乎你不想咱俩住在一起
<3-17,Leonard>It sounds to me like you don't want us to live together.

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,070
<3-19,Leonard>我们总是在一起
<3-19,Leonard>We're together all the time.

153
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,660
<3-19,Leonard>钱方面来看  同住好处多多啊
<3-19,Leonard>Financially, it makes great sense.

154
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,780
<3-19,Leonard>你能想出一个我们不该住在一起的理由吗
<3-19,Leonard>Can you think of one reason why we shouldn't do this?

155
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,880
<3-20,Penny>这个嘛...

<3-25,Leonard>我每天要吃超多药
<3-25,Leonard>I take a lot of medicine.

<4-4,Raj>But, uh, I've had a lovely time eating your brisket

174
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,880
<4-4,Raj>边听你说你这些年从自己身上
<4-4,Raj>and hearing about the things you've had removed

175
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,310
<4-4,Raj>切除下来的各种东西

<6-3,Sheldon>So, uh, I was just talking to Amy,

237
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,960
<6-3,Sheldon>她让我意识到
<6-3,Sheldon>and she made me realize

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,260

245
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,350
<6-5,Sheldon>-别拐弯抹角了  谢尔顿  -好吧
<6-5,Sheldon>- Cut to the chase, Sheldon. - Okay.

246
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,360
<7-1,Sheldon>艾米说要搬进来住
<7-1,Sheldon>Amy's decided she wants to move in with me,

247
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,450
<7-1,Sheldon>所以我需要你回家  你个可爱的小调皮
<7-1,Sheldon>so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp.

248
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,810
<7-1,Sheldon>头上抹好多东西啊
<7-1,Sheldon>That's a lot of product.

249
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,690
<7-3,Leonard>-怎么了  -是这样的
<7-3,Leonard>- What's going on? - Oh, get this:

250
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,490
<7-3,Leonard>谢尔顿突然又想让我回去了
<7-3,Leonard>suddenly, Sheldon wants me back

251
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,230
<7-3,Leonard>因为艾米想搬进去和他一起住
<7-3,Leonard>because Amy wants to move in with him.

252
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,450
<7-4,Penny>是吗  真有意思
<7-4,Penny>Really? Interesting.

253
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,360
<7-5,Leonard>太晚了  伙计  我哪也不去
<7-5,Leonard>Well, too late, pal. I'm not going anywhere.

254
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,430
<7-5,Leonard>佩妮和我在一起非常幸福快乐
<7-5,Leonard>Penny and I are very happy living together.

255
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,820
<7-5,Leonard>对吗
<7-5,Leonard>Isn't that right?

256
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,900
<7-6,Penny>就像是幸福要赖在这公寓里不走了呢
<7-6,Penny>It's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.

257
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,810
<7-7,Sheldon>莱纳德  拜托了
<7-7,Sheldon>Leonard, please.

258
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,290
<7-7,Sheldon>你知道艾米搬进来就意味着我们要面对
<7-7,Sheldon>You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy

259
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,920
<7-7,Sheldon>我们压根没准备好的亲密关系
<7-7,Sheldon>our relationship isn't ready for.

260
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,120
<7-8,Penny>没错  这事真有其事
<7-8,Penny>Yes! That is a real thing.

261
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,740
<7-8,Penny>这不代表你们不在乎彼此
<7-8,Penny>And it doesn't mean you don't care about each other;

262
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,180
<7-8,Penny>只是这种节奏
<7-8,Penny>it just means things are moving at a pace

263
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,520
<7-8,Penny>让你感到不安  这很正常
<7-8,Penny>you're not comfortable with, and that's fine.

264
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,450
<7-9,Leonard>如果他不想和她一起住
<7-9,Leonard>Well, if he doesn't want to live with her,

265
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,510
<7-9,Leonard>那他就应该当面讲清楚
<7-9,Leonard>then he should tell her how he feels.

266
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,690
<7-10,Penny>也许他是不知道要怎样说
<7-10,Penny>Well, maybe he doesn't know how to say it

267
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,310
<7-10,Penny>才能不伤害她的感情
<7-10,Penny>without hurting her feelings.

268
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,180
<7-10,Penny>感情
<7-10,Penny>Feelings?

269
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,430
<7-11,Sheldon>你以为我是嬉皮士在谈情说爱啊  不是的
<7-11,Sheldon>What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No.

270
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,060
<7-11,Sheldon>问题是
<7-11,Sheldon>The problem is,

271
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,030
<7-11,Sheldon>她说出了一系列我根本无法反驳的
<7-11,Sheldon>she laid out a series of logical arguments

272
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,100
<7-11,Sheldon>逻辑论证
<7-11,Sheldon>that I couldn't refute.

273
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,400
<7-12,Penny>-这样最糟糕了  对吗  -没错
<7-12,Penny>- That is the worst, isn't it? - Yes.

274
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,530
<7-14,Leonard>抱歉  谢尔顿  我无能为力
<7-14,Leonard>I'm sorry, Sheldon. I can't help you.

275
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,580
<7-14,Leonard>剧透警告
<7-14,Leonard>Oh, spoiler alert:

276
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,890
<7-14,Leonard>这门要摔你脸上了
<7-14,Leonard>this door's about to slam in your face.

277
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
<7-15,Amy>你在这啊
<7-15,Amy>Oh, there you are.

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,010
<7-15,Amy>我什么时候能拿到"我们家"的钥匙呀
<7-15,Amy>When do I get a key to our apartment?

279

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,250
<8-7,Raj>晚饭后  我们看了《罗克福德档案》的重播
<8-7,Raj>After dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files,

288
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,830
<8-7,Raj>然后她开了一瓶
<8-7,Raj>and then she opened a bottle

289
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,990
<8-7,Raj>奶油雪利酒  然后不知不觉
<8-7,Raj>of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know,

290
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,840
<8-7,Raj>她就把我哄上你的床睡觉了
<8-7,Raj>she was tucking me into your bed.

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,610
<8-8,Howard>你穿的是我的睡衣吗
<8-8,Howard>You wore my pajamas?

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,630
<8-9,Raj>你平时到底怎么睡的啊
<8-9,Raj>How do you sleep in these things?

00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,470
<8-9,Raj>真丝睡衣配绸缎床单
<8-9,Raj>Silk pajamas on satin sheets?

294
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,680
<8-9,Raj>我滑下床三次了都
<8-9,Raj>I slid out of the bed, like, three times.

295
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,910
<8-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>拉杰什
<8-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Rajesh!

<8-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>你起来了吗
<8-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>You up?

297
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,300
<8-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>准备好吃早饭了吗

<8-12,Howard>拉杰  听我说
<8-12,Howard>Okay, Raj, listen to me.

300
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,870
<8-12,Howard>你得马上走
<8-12,Howard>You need to get out of there.

301
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,570
<8-13,Raj>但我的奶油酒宿醉还没退
<8-13,Raj>But I have a cream sherry hangover

302
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,980
<8-13,Raj>而且我还闻到薄饼卷的味道了
<8-13,Raj>and I smell blintzes.

303
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,240
<8-14,Howard>如果你现在不走
<8-14,Howard>If you don't leave now,

304
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,810
<8-14,Howard>她就会利用食物和你的愧疚感
<8-14,Howard>she'll use food and guilt

305
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,960
<8-14,Howard>让你后半辈子一直困在那
<8-14,Howard>to keep you there for the rest of your life.

306
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,150
<8-15,Raj>霍华德  别说了
<8-15,Raj>Oh, Howard, stop.

307
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,380
<8-16,Howard>相信我  你不是犹太人
<8-16,Howard>Trust me, you're not Jewish.

308
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,060
<8-16,Howard>犹太人就是这么收服人的
<8-16,Howard>That's how they get you.

309
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,340
<8-17,Raj>你别说傻话了
<8-17,Raj>You're being silly.

310
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,290
<8-17,Raj>我想什么时候走就能什么时候走
<8-17,Raj>I can leave whenever I want.

311
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,900
<8-18,Howard>是吗  那你的衣服和鞋在哪呢
<8-18,Howard>Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?

312

<8-19,Raj>在椅子上呢  就在...
<8-19,Raj>They're on the chair, right over...

313
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,760
<8-19,Raj>糟糕[犹太人用语]
<8-19,Raj>Oy vey.

314
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,350
<9-1,Sheldon>你好  家庭破坏者
<9-1,Sheldon>Hello, home wrecker.

315
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,100
<9-2,Penny>我怎么了
<9-2,Penny>What did I do?

316
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,310
<9-3,Sheldon>你给了莱纳德退路
<9-3,Sheldon>You gave Leonard somewhere to go.

317
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,810
<9-3,Sheldon>就因为你
<9-3,Sheldon>Thanks to you,

318
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,750
<9-3,Sheldon>艾米现在去买情侣浴巾了
<9-3,Sheldon>Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels.

319
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,370
<9-3,Sheldon>就好像我真会用上面写有
<9-3,Sheldon>Like I'd ever dry myself with something

320
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,710
<9-3,Sheldon>所有格代名词的东西擦身子似的
<9-3,Sheldon>that has a possessive pronoun on it.

321
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,660
<9-4,Penny>听我说
<9-4,Penny>Okay, listen.

322
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,820
<9-4,Penny>其实我根本不想跟他住
<9-4,Penny>The truth is I don't want him living with me.

323
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,460
<9-5,Sheldon>太好了  那把他赶出来
<9-5,Sheldon>Great. Kick him out.

324
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,370
<9-5,Sheldon>伤他的心  皆大欢喜
<9-5,Sheldon>Break his heart. Everybody wins.

325
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,240
<9-6,Penny>不  我不想伤他的心
<9-6,Penny>No, I don't want to break his heart.

326
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,150
<9-6,Penny>我爱他
<9-6,Penny>I love him.

327
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,700
<9-6,Penny>但他搬过来让我很措手不及
<9-6,Penny>This is just happening too fast.

328
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,330
<9-7,Sheldon>这就叫措手不及啊
<9-7,Sheldon>You think this is fast?

329
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,140
<9-7,Sheldon>要不了多久我的洗澡间
<9-7,Sheldon>It's just a matter of time

330
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,120
<9-7,Sheldon>就能看见艾米掉的腿毛了
<9-7,Sheldon>before I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.

331
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,770
<9-8,Penny>我可见过她的腿
<9-8,Penny>Yeah, and I've seen those legs.

332
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,890
<9-8,Penny>你最好准备点管道疏通剂
<9-8,Penny>You might want to get some Drano.

333
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,380
<9-9,Sheldon>等一下
<9-9,Sheldon>Hold on.

334
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,130
<9-9,Sheldon>如果你不想和莱纳德一起住
<9-9,Sheldon>If you don't want to live with Leonard,

335
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,360
<9-9,Sheldon>那你为什么不跟他直说
<9-9,Sheldon>why don't you just tell him?

336
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,660
<9-10,Penny>你知道他这个人
<9-10,Penny>Well, you know how he is.

337
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,250
<9-10,Penny>又敏感  又感性
<9-10,Penny>He's sensitive and emotional.

338
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,680
<9-11,Sheldon>那是因为他喝太多豆奶了
<9-11,Sheldon>That's because he drinks too much soy milk.

339
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,660
<9-12,Penny>不过除了告诉他们事实
<9-12,Penny>Well, I don't know what else we can do

340
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,450
<9-12,Penny>我也想不出其他办法了
<9-12,Penny>but tell them the truth.

341
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,950
<9-13,Sheldon>看来我们必须得
<9-13,Sheldon>I suppose there's no choice

342
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,780
<9-13,Sheldon>面对他们泪如雨下  怒发苛责
<9-13,Sheldon>but to face the crying, angry accusations

343
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,320
<9-13,Sheldon>以及尖声绝望的哀嚎
<9-13,Sheldon>and the high-pitched wails of despair.

344
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,360
<9-13,Sheldon>对啊
<9-13,Sheldon>Yeah.

345
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,730
<9-14,Penny>而艾米的反应就不知道了
<9-14,Penny>And who knows how Amy will react.

346
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,530
<10-1,Howard>冰来了
<10-1,Howard>Here's some more ice.

347
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,960
<10-2,Bernadette>谢谢
<10-2,Bernadette>Oh, thanks.

348
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,640
<10-3,Howard>我们脑子进水了吗
<10-3,Howard>What were we thinking?

349
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,690
<10-3,Howard>按正常方式来做不就行了嘛
<10-3,Howard>We should have just done it the regular way.

350
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,670
<10-4,Bernadette>太阳马戏团里的中国杂技演员
<10-4,Bernadette>Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil

351
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,770
<10-4,Bernadette>做起来感觉超轻松啊
<10-4,Bernadette>made it look so easy.

352
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,000
<10-5,Howard>不过说实话  如果我的腰能弯成那样
<10-5,Howard>Honestly, if I could bend that far,

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,290
<10-5,Howard>我还用得着你吗
<10-5,Howard>what would I need with you?

354
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,730
<10-6,Bernadette>如果你的腰能弯成那样  那咱俩省事多了
<10-6,Bernadette>If you could bend that far, you'd be doing us both a favor.

355
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,120
<10-7,Howard>拉杰  还好吗
<10-7,Howard>Hey, Raj. What's up?

356
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,240
<10-8,Raj>你太对了
<10-8,Raj>You were right!

357
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,470
<10-8,Raj>我逃不掉了
<10-8,Raj>I can't get out of here!

358
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,610
<10-9,Howard>你还在我妈家吗
<10-9,Howard>You're still at my mother's?

359
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,610
<10-10,Raj>我被困在这里了
<10-10,Raj>I'm trapped.

360
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,320
<10-10,Raj>我的衣服已经洗了一整天了
<10-10,Raj>My clothes have been in the laundry all day,

361
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,990
<10-10,Raj>而且钥匙也被她藏起来了
<10-10,Raj>and she hid my keys.

362
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,400
<10-10,Raj>我觉得有可能在她的文胸里
<10-10,Raj>I think they might be in her bra,

363
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,110
<10-10,Raj>因为她走起路来叮当响
<10-10,Raj>because she jingles when she walks.

364
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,040
<10-10,Raj>我该怎么办
<10-10,Raj>What do I do?

365

<10-14,Raj>她不会想帮我洗澡吧
<10-14,Raj>She's not gonna bathe me, is she?

371

<11-11,Amy>为我们写了电话答录机留言
<11-11,Amy>a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.

403
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,470
<11-21,Amy>那是因为什么
<11-21,Amy>Well, what is it, then?

404
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,540
<11-21,Amy>我都是按照你喜欢的方式来做事的
<11-21,Amy>I did everything just the way you like it.

<11-23,Amy>我们恋爱超过两年了
<11-23,Amy>We have been going out for over two years,

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,850
<11-23,Amy>我对你还不够有耐心吗
<11-23,Amy>and I have been nothing but patient with you!

<11-23,Amy>我看你喜欢的傻缺太空电影
<11-23,Amy>I watch your dopey space movies.

409
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,300
<11-23,Amy>我签署你那荒谬的恋爱合约
<11-23,Amy>I signed your ridiculous contract.

410
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,060
<11-23,Amy>我甚至不再擦润唇膏  因为你说
<11-23,Amy>I even stopped wearing lip gloss 'cause you said

411
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,540
<11-23,Amy>那样我的嘴唇看起来太滑了
<11-23,Amy>it made my mouth look too slippery.

412
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,520
<11-23,Amy>你再也找不到
<11-23,Amy>I am the best girlfriend

413
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,870
<11-23,Amy>比我更好的女朋友了
<11-23,Amy>you're ever gonna have.

414
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,850
<11-23,Amy>给我一个为什么我不能住这里的好理由
<11-23,Amy>You give me one good reason why I can't live here.

415
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,780
<11-24,Sheldon>全是佩妮的错
<11-24,Sheldon>It's Penny's fault.

416
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,310
<11-25,Amy>什么
<11-25,Amy>What?

417
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,330
<11-25,Amy>她不想和莱纳德一起住
<11-25,Amy>She doesn't want to live with Leonard,

418
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,960
<11-26,Sheldon>所以他必须回来和我住
<11-26,Sheldon>so he has to come live here again.

419
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,990
<11-26,Sheldon>她是我们伊甸园里的毒蛇
<11-26,Sheldon>She's the snake in our garden.

420
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,850
<11-26,Sheldon>她是我们不能做亚当夏娃快乐生活的元凶
<11-26,Sheldon>She's the reason we can't be happy.

421
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,160
<12-1,Penny>艾艾
<12-1,Penny>Hey, Ames. Yeah.

422
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,430
<12-1,Penny>别跟我套近乎
<12-1,Penny>"Hey, Ames," Nothing.

423
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,920
<12-2,Amy>我都已经准备好搬去谢尔顿家了
<12-2,Amy>I was all set to move in with Sheldon,

424
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,000
<12-2,Amy>现在我知道不行
<12-2,Amy>and now I hear I can't

425
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,890
<12-5,Sheldon>-因为你不想和莱纳德一起住  -什么
<12-5,Sheldon>- 'cause you don't want to live with Leonard. - What?

426
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,820
<12-4,Penny>谢尔顿  你说了什么
<12-4,Penny>Sheldon, what did you say?

427
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,250
<12-5,Sheldon>我说了实话
<12-5,Sheldon>I said the truth.

428
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,360
<12-5,Sheldon>你不想和莱纳德一起住  你心知肚明
<12-5,Sheldon>You don't want to live with Leonard, and you know it.

429
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,920
<12-6,Leonard>你什么时候开始不想和我一起住
<12-6,Leonard>Since when don't you want to live with me?

430
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,840
<12-7,Penny>别冲我发火
<12-7,Penny>Oh, don't get all huffy.

431
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,420
<12-7,Penny>是你自作主张决定搬进来
<12-7,Penny>You're the one who decided to move in

432
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,800
<12-7,Penny>问都没问过我是否准备好了
<12-7,Penny>without even asking me if I was ready.

433
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,440
<12-8,Sheldon>我认为应该好好说说这点
<12-8,Sheldon>Yeah, I think we should talk about that.

434
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,530
<12-9,Penny>既然你这么喜欢说出真相
<12-9,Penny>And since you love the truth so much,

435
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,330
<12-9,Penny>你为什么不告诉艾米你不想和她一起住
<12-9,Penny>why don't you tell Amy you don't want to live with her

436
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,000
<12-9,Penny>别用我做替罪羊
<12-9,Penny>instead of blaming it on me?

437
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,580
<12-10,Sheldon>我以为我们在说另一件事
<12-10,Sheldon>I thought we were talking about the other thing.

438
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,980
<12-11,Amy>你是个胆小鬼
<12-11,Amy>You're a coward.

439
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,330
<12-12,Sheldon>好吧  证据的确支持这一论点
<12-12,Sheldon>Well, the evidence does support that.

440
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,850
<12-13,Penny>来吧  艾米  我们去喝点红酒
<12-13,Penny>Come on, Amy, let's go drink wine

441
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,410
<12-13,Penny>然后吐槽下我们的男朋友有多混蛋
<12-13,Penny>and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.

442
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,710
<12-14,Amy>知道怎样才能让他们明白吗
<12-14,Amy>You know what would show them?

443
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,950
<12-14,Amy>我应该搬来和你一起住
<12-14,Amy>I should move in here with you.

444
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,060
<12-16,Sheldon>你想不想
<12-16,Sheldon>Do you want to...

445
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,130
<12-16,Sheldon>追几集新的《行尸走肉》
<12-16,Sheldon>catch up on some Walking Dead?

446
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,920
<12-17,Leonard>好吧
<12-17,Leonard>Okay.

447
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,360
<12-18,Sheldon>你有看过洛丽死的那集吗
<12-18,Sheldon>Have you seen the one where Lori dies?

448
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,680
<12-19,Leonard>没有
<12-19,Leonard>No.

449
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,590
<12-20,Sheldon>也许她没死呢
<12-20,Sheldon>Or maybe she doesn't.

450
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,390
<12-20,Sheldon>咱们来看看吧
<12-20,Sheldon>Let's find out.

451
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,560
<13-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>-你想去哪里  -不要
<13-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>- Where you going? - No!
