1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,060
<1-1,Sheldon>我又开始考虑时光旅行的事了
<1-1,Sheldon>You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,820
<1-2,Leonard>为什么?  你撞上看不见的障碍物了?
<1-2,Leonard>Why? did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,670
<1-3,Sheldon>先不提那个
<1-3,Sheldon>Put it on a backburner.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,040
<1-3,Sheldon>不论如何  我突然想到
<1-3,Sheldon>Anyway. it occurs to me,

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,940
<1-3,Sheldon>如果我能有个完美的时光机
<1-3,Sheldon>If I have ever did perfect time machine,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,110
<1-3,Sheldon>我就能回到过去  把它送给当时的我
<1-3,Sheldon>I'd just go into the past and give it to myself.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,670
<1-3,Sheldon>那样我就不用现做一个了
<1-3,Sheldon>That's eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,520
<1-4,Leonard>有意思
<1-4,Leonard>Interesting.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,930
<1-5,Sheldon>这确实能消除压力
<1-5,Sheldon>Yeah, it really kicks the pressure off.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,180
<1-5,Sheldon>听起来是个新突破
<1-5,Sheldon>Sounds like a breakthrough.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,680
<1-6,Leonard>要不要我打电话到科学期刊 让你上封面?
<1-6,Leonard>Should I call science magazine and tell them to hold the cover?

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,120
<1-7,Sheldon>这可是时光旅行  我应该早就上封面了
<1-7,Sheldon>It's time travel, I will have already done that.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
<1-8,Leonard>那我想接下来我该恭喜你了
<1-8,Leonard>Then I guess congratulations are in order.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,170
<1-9,Sheldon>不  那时你应该已经恭喜过了
<1-9,Sheldon>No, congratulations will have been in order.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,500
<1-9,Sheldon>你知道  我不会喜欢这个派对的
<1-9,Sheldon>You know, I am not going to enjoy this party.

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,470
<1-10,Leonard>我知道  我太了解你了
<1-10,Leonard>I know, I'm familiar with you.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,730
<1-11,Sheldon>上次系里聚会  芬克顿教授缠着我
<1-11,Sheldon>The last department party, professor Finkleday cornered me

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,160
<1-11,Sheldon>一直和我探讨洞穴探险  谈了45分钟
<1-11,Sheldon>And talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,420
<1-12,Leonard>没错  我也在那儿
<1-12,Leonard>Yes, I was there.

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,450
<1-13,Sheldon>你知道洞穴有什么意思吗?
<1-13,Sheldon>You know what's interesting about caves?

21
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,990
<1-15,Sheldon>-什么?  -什么都没有
<1-15,Sheldon>-what? -nothing.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,430
<1-16,Leonard>那么我们就避开他  去见新的系主任
<1-16,Leonard>Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head,

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,250
<1-16,Leonard>向他道喜  和他握手  然后离开
<1-16,Leonard>Congratulate him, shake his hand and go.

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,100
<1-16,Leonard>这样说如何?  很高兴见到您  盖博豪斯博士
<1-16,Leonard>How's this? "pleased to meet you, dr. gablehauser.

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,180
<1-17,Sheldon>你真走运  学校选了你做系主任
<1-17,Sheldon>"how fortunate for you that the university's

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,920
<1-17,Sheldon>尽管事实上
<1-17,Sheldon>"chosen to hire you, despite the fact

27
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,280
<1-17,Sheldon>25年里您从未有过原创性的研究
<1-17,Sheldon>"that you've done no original research in 25 years,

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,460
<1-17,Sheldon>仅仅出版了一系列畅销书
<1-17,Sheldon>"and instead have written a series of popular books

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,340
<1-17,Sheldon>把伟大的科技理念
<1-17,Sheldon>"that reduce the great concepts of science

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,720
<1-17,Sheldon>贬低成了一连串的奇闻异事
<1-17,Sheldon>"to a series of anecdotes,

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,110
<1-17,Sheldon>那些故事烂到刚好可以
<1-17,Sheldon>"each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration

32
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,190
<1-17,Sheldon>供我们上厕所的时候消遣一下
<1-17,Sheldon>"of an average bowel movement.

33
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,630
<1-17,Sheldon>谢谢(夏威夷语)
<1-17,Sheldon>Mahalo."

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,380
<1-18,Leonard>谢谢这个词加的不错
<1-18,Leonard>"mahalo's" a nice touch.

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,820
<1-19,Sheldon>你知道夏威夷语只有8个辅音吗
<1-19,Sheldon>You know there only eight consonants in hawaiian language?

36
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,060
<1-20,Leonard>有意思  你该好好研究一下那个
<1-20,Leonard>Interesting. you should lead with that.

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,600
<2-1,Raj>天啊  看看这个自助
<2-1,Raj>Oh, god, look at this buffet.

38
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,610
<2-1,Raj>我爱美国
<2-1,Raj>I love america.

39
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,540
<2-2,Leonard>印度没有自助吗
<2-2,Leonard>You don't have buffets in india?

40
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,010
<2-3,Raj>当然有  但都是印度食物
<2-3,Raj>Of course, but it's all indian food.

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,430
<2-3,Raj>在孟买连个救命的面包圈都找不到
<2-3,Raj>You can't find a bagel in mumbai to save your life.

42
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,770
<2-3,Raj>帮我抹一下
<2-3,Raj>Shmear me.

43
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,950
<2-4,Sheldon>-这回有趣了  -什么?
<2-4,Sheldon>-here's an interesting turn of events. -what?

44
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,630
<2-5,Leonard>霍华德带了个女伴?
<2-5,Leonard>Howard brought a date?

45
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,290
<2-6,Sheldon>更可信的解释是
<2-6,Sheldon>A more plausible explanation is that

46
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,810
<2-6,Sheldon>他的机器人学研究
<2-6,Sheldon>His work in robotics has made

47
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,460
<2-6,Sheldon>取得了质的飞跃
<2-6,Sheldon>An amazing leap forward.

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,450
<2-7,Howard>你们好啊  科学婊子们?
<2-7,Howard>Hey, what up, science bitches?

49
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,850
<2-7,Howard>请允许我向你们介绍
<2-7,Howard>May I introduce my

50
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,590
<2-7,Howard>我的特别女伴夏末
<2-7,Howard>Special lady friend summer?

51
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,480
<2-8,Summer>-我说过身体接触要另外付费  -好  对不起
<2-8,Summer>-i told you touching's extra. -right. sorry.

52
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,730
<2-10,Leonard (to Sheldon)>我们的新老板来了  礼貌一点
<2-10,Leonard (to Sheldon)>Here comes our new boss. be polite.

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,430
<2-11,Gablehouser>嗨  伙计们  艾瑞克·盖博豪斯
<2-11,Gablehouser>Hi, fellas. eric gablehauser.

54
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,710
<2-12,Howard>霍华德·沃尔维茨
<2-12,Howard>Howard Wolowitz.

55
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,140
<2-13,Gablehouser>很高兴见到你  你是?
<2-13,Gablehouser>Nice to meet you. and you are?

56
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,030
<2-14,Sheldon>一个真真正正的科学家
<2-14,Sheldon>An actual real scientist.

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,790
<2-14,Sheldon>这样如何?
<2-14,Sheldon>How was that?

58
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,580
<3-1,Sheldon>真不敢相信他把我炒了
<3-1,Sheldon>I can't believe he fired me.

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,030
<3-2,Leonard>谁让你说他只是个名声显赫的高中理科老师
<3-2,Leonard>Well, you did call him a glorified high school science teacher

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,380
<3-2,Leonard>还说他最近成功的实验只是放屁
<3-2,Leonard>Whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.

61
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,960
<3-3,Sheldon>我要为自己辩护一下
<3-3,Sheldon>In my defense,

62
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,560
<3-3,Sheldon>我一开始就说了  恕我冒昧
<3-3,Sheldon>I prefaced that by saying, "with all due respect."

68
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,210
<4-1,Leonard>早上好
<4-1,Leonard>Morning.

69
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,570
<4-2,Sheldon>早上好
<4-2,Sheldon>Morning.

70
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,910
<4-3,Leonard>你打算早餐吃鸡蛋?
<4-3,Leonard>You're making eggs for breakfast?

71
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,620
<4-4,Sheldon>这不是早餐  这是个实验
<4-4,Sheldon>This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.

72
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,590
<4-5,Leonard>那看起来很像是早餐
<4-5,Leonard>Cause it looks a lot like breakfast.

73
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,160
<4-6,Sheldon>我终于有时间验证我的假设
<4-6,Sheldon>I finally have time to test my hypothesis

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,150
<4-6,Sheldon>看看水分子从鸡蛋的蛋白质中分离出来
<4-6,Sheldon>About the separation of the water molecules

75
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,250
<4-6,Sheldon>是否对口感有影响
<4-6,Sheldon>From the egg proteins and its impact vis-a-vis taste.

76
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,990
<4-7,Leonard>听起来很好吃
<4-7,Leonard>Sounds yummy.

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,110
<4-7,Leonard>我期待你用火腿做实验
<4-7,Leonard>I look forward to your work with bacon.

78
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,550
<4-8,Sheldon>我也是
<4-8,Sheldon>As do i.

79
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,380
<4-9,Leonard>我相信只要你跟
<4-9,Leonard>You know, I'm sure if you just apologize

80
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,580
<4-9,Leonard>盖博豪斯道歉  他会让你复职的
<4-9,Leonard>To gablehauser, he would give you your job back.

81
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,950
<4-9,Leonard>我不想复职
<4-9,Leonard>I don't want my job back.

82
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,240
<4-10,Sheldon>我过去3年半都一直
<4-10,Sheldon>I've spent the past three and a half years

83
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,240
<4-10,Sheldon>盯着写满等式的黑板
<4-10,Sheldon>Staring at grease boards full of equations.

84
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,870
<4-10,Sheldon>那之前  我花了4年完成我的论文
<4-10,Sheldon>Before that, I spent four years working on my thesis.

85
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,430
<4-10,Sheldon>再之前  我在上大学
<4-10,Sheldon>Before that, I was in college,

86
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,590
<4-10,Sheldon>再再之前  我上5年级
<4-10,Sheldon>And before that, I was in the fifth grade.

87
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,580
<4-10,Sheldon>这是我十年来第一个休息日  我要好好享受
<4-10,Sheldon>This is my first day off in decades and I'm going to savor it.

88
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,010
<4-11,Leonard>那你好好研究你的鸡蛋理论吧
<4-11,Leonard>I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.

89
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,860
<4-12,Sheldon>不只是我的鸡蛋  是大家的鸡蛋
<4-12,Sheldon>Not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

90
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,250
<4-13,Leonard>我们都感谢你
<4-13,Leonard>And we all thank you.

91
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,670
<4-14,Sheldon>用了新的鸡蛋
<4-14,Sheldon>Use new eggs.

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,280
<4-15,Penny (popping her head round)>我要去超市  你们需要什么吗
<4-15,Penny (popping her head round)>I'm running out to the market. you need anything?

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,180
<4-16,Sheldon>这应该属于那种
<4-16,Sheldon>This would be one of those circumstances

94
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,190
<4-16,Sheldon>不熟悉大数法则的人称之为
<4-16,Sheldon>That people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a

95
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,710
<4-16,Sheldon>"巧合"的情况
<4-16,Sheldon>Coincidence.

96
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,880
<4-18,Sheldon>-你说什么?  -我要买鸡蛋
<4-18,Sheldon>-i'm sorry? -i need eggs.

97
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,430
<4-18,Sheldon>4打应该够了
<4-18,Sheldon>Four dozen should suffice.

98
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
<4-19,Penny>-4打?  -没错
<4-19,Penny>-four dozen? -yes,

99
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,790
<4-20,Sheldon>要棕色皮的  白皮的
<4-20,Sheldon>And evenly distributed amongst brown, white,

100
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,340
<4-20,Sheldon>无公害的  大的  特大个的  巨蛋各几个
<4-20,Sheldon>Free-range, large, extra large and jumbo.

101
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,290
<4-21,Penny>好吧  再说一次
<4-21,Penny>Okay, one more time.

102
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,360
<4-22,Sheldon>没关系  你估计弄不对
<4-22,Sheldon>Never mind. you won't get it right.

103
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,410
<4-22,Sheldon>我最好和你一起去
<4-22,Sheldon>I'd better come with you.

104
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,480
<5-1,Penny>你今天怎么没去上班?
<5-1,Penny>How come you didn't go into work today?

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
<5-2,Sheldon>我现在休假
<5-2,Sheldon>I'm taking a sabbatical

106
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,550
<5-2,Sheldon>因为我不要对那种俗人低三下四
<5-2,Sheldon>Because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

107
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,860
<5-3,Penny>所以你被解雇了  对吗
<5-3,Penny>So you got canned, huh?

108
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,950
<5-4,Sheldon>理论物理学家不会被炒鱿鱼的...
<5-4,Sheldon>Theoretical physicists do not get canned...

109
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
<5-4,Sheldon>但是确实是被炒了
<5-4,Sheldon>But yeah.

110
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,780
<5-5,Penny>也许那样更好呢
<5-5,Penny>Maybe it's all for the best.

111
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,570
<5-5,Penny>我一直说一扇门关上的同时  另一扇门也已打开
<5-5,Penny>I always say when one door closes, another one opens.

112
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,540
<5-6,Sheldon>不  不是那样的
<5-6,Sheldon>No, it doesn't.

113
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,750
<5-6,Sheldon>除非那两扇门有继电器
<5-6,Sheldon>Not unless the two doors are connected by relays

114
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,360
<5-6,Sheldon>-或者感应器连着  -不  我是说...
<5-6,Sheldon>-or there are motion sensors involved. -no, I meant...

115
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,940
<5-8,Sheldon>否则第一扇门关上造成的气压变化
<5-8,Sheldon>Or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure

116
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,570
<5-8,Sheldon>会带动第二扇门也关上
<5-8,Sheldon>That acts upon the second door.

117
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
<5-9,Penny>算了
<5-9,Penny>Never mind.

118
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,890
<5-10,Sheldon>慢一点
<5-10,Sheldon>Slow down.

119
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,370
<5-10,Sheldon>-求你了  慢一点  -没事的
<5-10,Sheldon>-please, slow down! -we're fine!

120
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,750
<5-12,Sheldon>你离前面的车距离太近了
<5-12,Sheldon>You're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.

121
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,640
<5-14,Sheldon>-当然  我知道  -不行  我给你算算
<5-14,Sheldon>-oh, sure, I am. -no, let me do the math for you.

122
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,220
<5-14,Sheldon>这个车重  就算是4000磅
<5-14,Sheldon>This car weighs, let's say 4,000 pounds.

123
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,360
<5-14,Sheldon>然后加上我的重量140磅  你的120磅...
<5-14,Sheldon>Now add 140 for me, 120 for you...

124
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,880
<5-15,Penny>120?
<5-15,Penny>120?

125
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,760
<5-16,Sheldon>对不起  我有冒犯到你吗
<5-16,Sheldon>I'm sorry. did I insult you?

126
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,450
<5-16,Sheldon>你的体重跟你的个人价值有关么?
<5-16,Sheldon>Is your body mass somehow tied into your self-worth?

127
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,300
<5-17,Penny>是的
<5-17,Penny>Well, yeah.

128
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,130
<5-17,Penny>有意思
<5-17,Penny>Interesting.

129
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,150
<5-18,Sheldon>不管怎么说  总共就算是
<5-18,Sheldon>Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,

130
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,890
<5-19,Penny>就算是4400磅
<5-19,Penny>Let's say 4,400 pounds.

131
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,320
<5-19,Penny>算4390磅吧
<5-19,Penny>Let's say 4,390.

132
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,060
<5-19,Penny>好吧  我们行驶时速是
<5-19,Penny>Fine. we're traveling forward at--

133
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,950
<5-20,Sheldon>天啊  51英里每小时
<5-20,Sheldon>Good lord--51 miles an hour.

134
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,960
<5-20,Sheldon>假设你的刹车是新的
<5-20,Sheldon>Let's assume that your brakes

135
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,760
<5-20,Sheldon>卡钳(刹车系统的一部分)在一条线上
<5-20,Sheldon>Are new and the calipers are aligned.

136
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,580
<5-20,Sheldon>然而  到我们要停下来的时候
<5-20,Sheldon>Still, by the time we come to a stop,

137
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,270
<5-20,Sheldon>我们会和前面的别克撞到一起
<5-20,Sheldon>We'll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us,

138
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,830
<5-20,Sheldon>不过致死  致残
<5-20,Sheldon>An impossibility that nature will quickly resolve

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,300
<5-20,Sheldon>倒是不可能的
<5-20,Sheldon>Into death, mutilation...

140
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,790
<5-20,Sheldon>看  他们修了一个新的高尔夫球场
<5-20,Sheldon>Oh, look, they built a new putt-putt course.

141
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,610
<6-1,Sheldon>太伟大了
<6-1,Sheldon>This is great.

142
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,130
<6-1,Sheldon>看着我
<6-1,Sheldon>Look at me.

143
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,110
<6-1,Sheldon>我活在一个凡人生活的
<6-1,Sheldon>I'm in the real world of ordinary people

144
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,620
<6-1,Sheldon>真实的世界里  无聊的上班一族
<6-1,Sheldon>Just living their ordinary, colorless workaday lives.

145
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
<6-2,Penny>谢谢你
<6-2,Penny>Thank you.

146
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,970
<6-2,Penny>不  谢谢你
<6-2,Penny>No, thankyou.

147
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,740
<6-3,Sheldon>也谢谢你  平凡的人
<6-3,Sheldon>And thank you, ordinary person.

148
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,320
<6-3,Sheldon>你想听听关于西红柿的有趣的事吗
<6-3,Sheldon>You want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes?

149
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,780
<6-4,Penny>不  我不太想
<6-4,Penny>No, not really.

150
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,650
<6-4,Penny>你不是说你要买鸡蛋吗
<6-4,Penny>Listen, didn't you say you need some eggs?

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,180
<6-5,Sheldon>是的  但是有谁知道细菌
<6-5,Sheldon>Yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth

152
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,850
<6-5,Sheldon>就是冷冻食品在离开超市的途中
<6-5,Sheldon>Knows to pick up their refrigerated food on the way out of the

153
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,330
<6-5,Sheldon>迅速繁殖的
<6-5,Sheldon>Supermarket.

154
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,310
<6-6,Penny>好吧  也许你该想办法解决一下
<6-6,Penny>Okay, then maybe you should start heading on out then.

155
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,290
<6-7,Sheldon>不 这很有趣
<6-7,Sheldon>No, this is fun.

156
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,560
<6-7,Sheldon>关于西红柿的是...我想你会喜欢的
<6-7,Sheldon>Oh, the thing about tomatoes-- and I think you'll really enjoy this--

157
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,220
<6-7,Sheldon>虽然摆在蔬菜架上  但理论上讲是水果
<6-7,Sheldon>Is they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit.

158
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,730
<6-9,Sheldon>-有意思  -真的吗
<6-9,Sheldon>-interesting. -isn't it?

159
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,030
<6-10,Penny>不  我是说你自得其乐
<6-10,Penny>No, I mean what you find enjoyable.

160
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,690
<6-11,Sheldon (as Penny selects vitamin supplements)>孩子
<6-11,Sheldon (as Penny selects vitamin supplements)>Oh, boy.

161
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
<6-12,Penny>又怎么了?
<6-12,Penny>What now?

162
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,960
<6-13,Sheldon>吃多种维生素是有很多好处
<6-13,Sheldon>Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin,

163
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
<6-13,Sheldon>但是人只能吸收一定的量
<6-13,Sheldon>But the human body can only absorb so much.

164
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,690
<6-13,Sheldon>所以你买这么多
<6-13,Sheldon>What you're buying here

165
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,530
<6-13,Sheldon>就是买一堆贵重的尿的原料
<6-13,Sheldon>Are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

166
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,720
<6-14,Penny>也许那就是我想要的
<6-14,Penny>Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

167
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,930
<6-15,Sheldon>那你就该买些锰
<6-15,Sheldon>Then you'll want some manganese.

168
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,290
<7-1,Sheldon>这很有意思
<7-1,Sheldon>That was fun.

169
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,970
<7-1,Sheldon>也许明天我们可以去大仓储商店转转
<7-1,Sheldon>Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.

170
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,260
<7-2,Penny>我没想好
<7-2,Penny>Oh, I don't know.

171
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,130
<7-2,Penny>也许我得花点时间消化今天的玩笑
<7-2,Penny>It's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.

172
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,150
<7-2,Penny>你确定?
<7-2,Penny>Are you sure?

173
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,280
<7-3,Sheldon>成批购买有很多好处的
<7-3,Sheldon>There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk.

174
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,960
<7-3,Sheldon>比如说  我注意到你买卫生巾
<7-3,Sheldon>For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons

175
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,570
<7-3,Sheldon>都是一次买一个月量的
<7-3,Sheldon>One-month supply at a time.

176
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,250
<7-4,Penny>什么?
<7-4,Penny>What?

177
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,880
<7-5,Sheldon>你考虑一下吧  那东西也放不坏
<7-5,Sheldon>Think about it. it's a product that doesn't spoil

178
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,300
<7-5,Sheldon>而且你至少还要用30年
<7-5,Sheldon>And you're going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years.

179
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,630
<7-6,Penny>你想让我一次买够30年用的?
<7-6,Penny>You want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons?

180
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,040
<7-7,Sheldon>30  35  你妈妈什么时候到更年期的?
<7-7,Sheldon>Well, 30, 35. when did your mother go into menopause?

181
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,660
<7-8,Penny>我不想现在和你谈这个
<7-8,Penny>I'm not talking about this with you.

182
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,550
<7-9,Sheldon>这是很自然的人生过程
<7-9,Sheldon>This is a natural human process,

183
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,100
<7-9,Sheldon>而且我们说的是怎么省钱的问题
<7-9,Sheldon>And we're talking about statistically significant savings.

184
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,030
<7-9,Sheldon>假设你一周期用15包卫生巾  28天一周期
<7-9,Sheldon>Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28-day cycle...

185
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,690
<7-9,Sheldon>你是定期来吗
<7-9,Sheldon>Are you fairly regular?

186
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,120
<7-9,Sheldon>那好吧  不去大仓储商店了
<7-9,Sheldon>Okay, no warehouse store,

187
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,380
<7-9,Sheldon>但我们还要去打高尔夫  好吗
<7-9,Sheldon>But we're still on for putt-putt golf, right?

188
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,230
<8-1,Leonard (entering)>我遇到潘妮  她好像有些不高兴
<8-1,Leonard (entering)>Hey, I just ran into penny. she seemed upset about something.

189
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,740
<8-2,Sheldon>我想她生理期到了
<8-2,Sheldon>I think it's her time of the month.

190
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,580
<8-2,Sheldon>以防以后要查  我在日历上标出来了
<8-2,Sheldon>I marked the calendar for future reference.

191
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,480
<8-3,Leonard>这鱼是怎么回事?
<8-3,Leonard>What's with the fish?

192
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,910
<8-4,Sheldon>我在做实验
<8-4,Sheldon>It's an experiment.

193
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,200
<8-5,Leonard>那个炒鸡蛋研究怎么样了?
<8-5,Leonard>What happened to your scrambled egg research?

194
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,630
<8-6,Sheldon>死路一条
<8-6,Sheldon>Oh, that was a dead end.

195
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,620
<8-6,Sheldon>炒鸡蛋怎么弄都一样
<8-6,Sheldon>Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.

196
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,380
<8-7,Leonard>那么...就研究鱼了?
<8-7,Leonard>So... fish?

197
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,010
<8-8,Sheldon>我读过一篇关于日本科学家们的文章
<8-8,Sheldon>I read an article about japanese scientists

198
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,890
<8-8,Sheldon>把发光的水母的基因植入其他动物体内
<8-8,Sheldon>Who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals,

199
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,190
<8-8,Sheldon>那么我想  夜光鱼
<8-8,Sheldon>And I thought, "hey, fish nightlights."

200
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,030
<8-9,Leonard>夜光鱼?
<8-9,Leonard>Fish nightlights?

201
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,020
<8-10,Sheldon>这主意能值一百万
<8-10,Sheldon>It's a billion-dollar idea.

202
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,550
<8-11,Leonard>我不会说出去的
<8-11,Leonard>Mum's the word.

203
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,720
<8-11,Leonard>你确定不要向
<8-11,Leonard>Are you sure you don't want

204
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,350
<8-11,Leonard>盖博豪斯道歉  回去工作?
<8-11,Leonard>To just apologize to gablehauser and get your job back?

205
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,880
<8-12,Sheldon>不去  我还有好多事要做
<8-12,Sheldon>No, I have too much to do.

206
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,420
<8-13,Leonard>比如会发光的鱼
<8-13,Leonard>Like luminous fish.

207
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,850
<8-15,Leonard>对不起  我没有...
<8-15,Leonard>I'm sorry. I didn't...

208
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,070
<8-16,Sheldon>这只是刚刚开始
<8-16,Sheldon>That's just the beginning.

209
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,630
<8-16,Sheldon>我还有一个好主意
<8-16,Sheldon>I also have an idea

210
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,430
<8-16,Sheldon>开一个批量邮购妇女卫生用品公司
<8-16,Sheldon>For a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company.

211
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,600
<8-16,Sheldon>夜光卫生巾
<8-16,Sheldon>Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons!

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,850
<8-16,Sheldon>里奥纳德  我们要发财了
<8-16,Sheldon>Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

213
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,830
<9-1,Leonard>谢谢您匆忙赶来
<9-1,Leonard>Thanks for coming on such short notice.

<9-2,Mrs Cooper>-你做的很对  -我不知道还能做什么
<9-2,Mrs Cooper>-you did the right thing calling. -i didn't know what else to do.

215
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,940
<9-3,Leonard>他迷失方向了  每天都沉迷于新想法
<9-3,Leonard>He's lost all focus. every day he's got a new obsession.

216
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,320
<9-3,Leonard>这个尤其让人困扰
<9-3,Leonard>This is a particularly disturbing one.

217

<9-4,Sheldon (looking round)>妈?

223
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,720
<9-10,Sheldon>我正在研究会发光的鱼  然后我想...
<9-10,Sheldon>I was working with luminous fish, and I thought...

<9-9,Mrs Cooper>织布机

226
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,360
<9-11,Mrs Cooper>里奥纳德打电话叫我来的
<9-11,Mrs Cooper>Leonard called me.

227
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,450
<9-12,Sheldon>我知道  但是为什么?
<9-12,Sheldon>I know, but why?

228
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,290
<9-13,Leonard>因为21世纪伟大的天才之一
<9-13,Leonard>Because one of the great minds of the 21st century

229
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,660
<9-13,Leonard>要养会发光的鱼  还要织披肩
<9-13,Leonard>Is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving serapes.

230
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,990
<9-14,Sheldon>这不是披肩  这是披风
<9-14,Sheldon>This is not a serape, this is a poncho.

231
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,270
<9-14,Sheldon>披肩在两边都是开着的  披风是一体的
<9-14,Sheldon>A serape is open at the sides; a poncho is closed.

232
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,410
<9-14,Sheldon>这是披风
<9-14,Sheldon>This is a poncho.

233
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,290
<9-14,Sheldon>不管是什么你都不该把我妈叫来
<9-14,Sheldon>And neither is a reason to call someone'smother.

<9-15,Leonard>真的?  你上次出门是什么时候?
<9-15,Leonard>Really? when was the last time you left the house?

235
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,590
<9-16,Sheldon>我和潘妮一起去超市
<9-16,Sheldon>I went to the market with penny.

<9-17,Leonard>那都是3个星期以前的事了
<9-17,Leonard>That was three weeks ago.

237
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,020
<9-18,Sheldon>然后就没出去过  后来的4到8天
<9-18,Sheldon>Well, then buckle up. in the next four to eight days

238
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,080
<9-18,Sheldon>她变得异常暴躁

<10-6,Howard>Excuse me for being so bold,

256
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,800
<10-6,Howard>但是我看出来谢尔顿的帅气遗传自谁了
<10-6,Howard>But I now see where sheldon gets his smoldering good looks.

337
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,960
<11-15,Mrs Cooper>但你不能一直强调这点
<11-15,Mrs Cooper>But you can't go around pointing it out.

338
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,800
<11-16,Sheldon>-为什么不能?  -因为人们不爱听
<11-16,Sheldon>-why not? -because people don't like it!

<11-17,Mrs Cooper>忘了当年你怎么被邻居家孩子欺负的?

<11-18,Sheldon>There wouldn't have been any ass-kickings

343
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,330
<11-18,Sheldon>管用的话  我就不会挨打
<11-18,Sheldon>If that stupid death ray had worked.

<12-1,Mrs Cooper>问题解决

<13-7,Sheldon>当我叫你是傻瓜时
<13-7,Sheldon>We may have gotten off on the wrong foot

356
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,450
<13-7,Sheldon>我们可能一开始就没看对眼
