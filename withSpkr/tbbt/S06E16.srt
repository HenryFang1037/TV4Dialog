1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,840
<1-1,Penny>你绝对想不到我今天工作时遇上了什么事
<1-1,Penny>You'll never believe what happened to me at work today.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,400
<1-3,Penny>一个老头子吃东西噎到了  我救了他一命
<1-3,Penny>This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,570
<1-4,Leonard>真的吗  你对他用了海姆立克急救法吗
<1-4,Leonard>You're kidding. Did you Heimlich him?

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,030
<1-5,Penny>没有  我说  天啊  我觉得他噎着了
<1-5,Penny>No. I said, "Oh, my God, I think that old guy's choking,"

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,220
<1-5,Penny>然后一个勤杂工对他用了海姆立克急救法
<1-5,Penny>and then one of the busboys Heimlich'ed him.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,960
<1-6,Leonard>你真是英雄
<1-6,Leonard>You're a hero.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,090
<1-7,Penny>我就是这意思
<1-7,Penny>Yeah, that was the point of the story.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,960
<1-8,Leonard>说到工作  你周四晚上
<1-8,Leonard>Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,260
<1-8,Leonard>是不是不用上班
<1-8,Leonard>if you have Thursday night off?

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,090
<1-9,Penny>好像是  怎么了
<1-9,Penny>Um, I think so. Why?

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,790
<1-10,Leonard>什么叫"怎么了"  那天是情人节啊
<1-10,Leonard>What do you mean, why? It's Valentine's Day.

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,890
<1-11,Penny>对哦
<1-11,Penny>Oh, right.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,550
<1-11,Penny>我们可以约个会
<1-11,Penny>Yeah, we can do something.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,860
<1-12,Leonard>你可以表现得更热情一点
<1-12,Leonard>You could be a little more into it.

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,560
<1-13,Penny>我很热情  我很热情
<1-13,Penny>No, I'm into it, I'm into it.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,620
<1-13,Penny>只是要想度过一个特别之夜压力好大
<1-13,Penny>Just, there's so much pressure to make the night special,

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,220
<1-13,Penny>而且结果总不尽如人意
<1-13,Penny>and it never works out.

18
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,150
<1-14,Leonard>今年的情人节会有所不同的
<1-14,Leonard>Okay, well, this time it's going to be different.

19
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,050
<1-14,Leonard>因为我就像一个浪漫忍者
<1-14,Leonard>Because I am like a romance ninja.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,640
<1-14,Leonard>出乎你意料  突然一下
<1-14,Leonard>You don't see it coming, and then bam!

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,930
<1-14,Leonard>浪漫  注意  心形  亲亲  爱情
<1-14,Leonard>Romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,910
<1-15,Penny>有时我以为我把你改造得
<1-15,Penny>You know, sometimes I think I've made you

23
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,300
<1-15,Penny>比以前酷多了
<1-15,Penny>so much cooler than you used to be,

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,160
<1-15,Penny>然后你就会闹腾两下证明我错了
<1-15,Penny>and then you go and do that.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,750
<2-1,Sheldon>总而言之
<2-1,Sheldon>So, in conclusion,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,480
<2-1,Sheldon>我认为吃完辣椒后
<2-1,Sheldon>I believe the painful sensation felt

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,920
<2-1,Sheldon>排泄时感受到的痛苦
<2-1,Sheldon>after passing a meal of spicy chilies

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,440
<2-1,Sheldon>证明了直肠的确有味觉
<2-1,Sheldon>is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,660
<2-2,Amy>我同意  但你改变了话题
<2-2,Amy>I concur, but you changed the subject.

30
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,000
<2-2,Amy>我们情人节有什么安排
<2-2,Amy>What are we doing for Valentine's Day?

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,850
<2-3,Sheldon>被你发现了
<2-3,Sheldon>Oh, you caught that, did you?

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,550
<2-3,Sheldon>生活大爆炸

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,990
<2-3,Sheldon>好
<2-3,Sheldon>Okay.

34

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,440
<3-2,Raj>一切都还"好"吗
<3-2,Raj>Everything okay?

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,340
<3-3,Howard>妮妮有些暴躁
<3-3,Howard>Bernie's a little cranky

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,820
<3-3,Howard>因为她一天工作17个小时
<3-3,Howard>since she's been working, like, 17 hours a day.

42
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,490
<3-3,Howard>我也没闲着  因为我一直
<3-3,Howard>And I've got a lot on my plate, too, because I've been

43
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,080
<3-3,Howard>都在忙着玩《刺客信条》
<3-3,Howard>busting my tail playing Assassin's Creed.

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,780
<3-4,Raj>斯图尔特
<3-4,Raj>Hey, Stuart,

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,530
<3-5,Stuart>没有
<3-5,Stuart>Not really.

47
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,260
<3-5,Stuart>只是把这里所有尖锐的东西都藏起来
<3-5,Stuart>Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here

48
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,110
<3-5,Stuart>然后紧张兮兮到天明
<3-5,Stuart>and white-knuckling it till morning.

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,760
<3-5,Stuart>你打算干什么
<3-5,Stuart>What do you got going on?

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,300
<3-6,Raj>我本打算和我的小宝贝

<3-6,Raj>它长了寄生虫  所以我得送它去看兽医
<3-6,Raj>she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,700
<3-7,Stuart>肯定能找到事情打发时间的
<3-7,Stuart>There must be something we can do.

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,780
<3-8,Raj>不如你晚点关门
<3-8,Raj>Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late,

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,530
<3-8,Raj>我们举办一个派对
<3-8,Raj>and we throw a party for all the people

56
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,100
<3-8,Raj>邀请所有没约会的人
<3-8,Raj>who don't have dates?

57
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,210
<3-8,Raj>听起来真是个好主意
<3-8,Raj>That actually sounds kind of nice.

58
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,740
<3-9,Raj>派对主题是  一个男人所拥有的
<3-9,Raj>Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love

59
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,120
<3-9,Raj>最伟大的爱就是对自己的爱
<3-9,Raj>a man can have is the love he has with himself.

60
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,270
<3-9,Raj>挺好
<3-9,Raj>That's good.

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,420
<3-10,Stuart>或者换个听着不那么像打飞机的主题
<3-10,Stuart>Or maybe something a little less "Hand in the pants."

62
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,440
<4-1,Sheldon>艾利克斯  太好了

<5-6,Howard>我动用了材料科学实验室的
<5-6,Howard>I used the atomic force microscope

94
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,280
<5-6,Howard>原子力显微镜  在沙粒千分之一大小的心形上
<5-6,Howard>in the material science lab and wrote our initials

95
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,930
<5-6,Howard>刻上了我俩姓名首字母
<5-6,Howard>in a heart 1/1,000 the size of a grain of sand.

00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,660
<5-10,Howard>大概12个小时
<5-10,Howard>Mmm, about 12 hours.

102
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,650
<5-10,Howard>我忙活了整个通宵

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,380
<5-14,Howard>还不错  但从浪漫的角度来说
<5-14,Howard>Oh, that's not bad, but as far as romance goes,

108
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,210
<5-14,Howard>我觉得我的礼物完全胜过了...
<5-14,Howard>I think my gift hits it right out of...

117
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,700
<6-2,Alex>了解了一下她的喜好
<6-2,Alex>and read up on her interests.

118
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,740
<6-3,Sheldon>瞧吧  我就绝对想不到这样做
<6-3,Sheldon>Now, see, I never would have thought to do that.

119
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,640
<6-3,Sheldon>很明显  把此事交给你来办
<6-3,Sheldon>Clearly, I made a good choice

120
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,750
<6-3,Sheldon>真是太英明了
<6-3,Sheldon>farming this out to you.

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,360
<6-3,Sheldon>艾米找到我做男朋友可真是中了头奖
<6-3,Sheldon>Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot.

123
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,610
<6-3,Sheldon>总之  我脚上有袜子
<6-3,Sheldon>Anyway, my socks are on.

125
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,530
<6-3,Sheldon>快快把它们吓掉吧
<6-3,Sheldon>Let's knock them off.

126
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,550
<6-4,Alex>我知道她喜欢弹竖琴
<6-4,Alex>Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp,

127
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,840
<6-4,Alex>所以我找到了这个精致的音乐盒
<6-4,Alex>so I found this beautiful music box

128
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,600
<6-4,Alex>弹奏的是她最喜欢的曲子
<6-4,Alex>that plays one of her favorite songs.

129
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,330
<6-5,Sheldon>可是艾米已经有真正的竖琴了
<6-5,Sheldon>Now, Amy already has a real harp.

130
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,970
<6-5,Sheldon>那玩意可以弹任何曲子
<6-5,Sheldon>And it can play any song.

131
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,180
<6-5,Sheldon>这一招的高明之处在哪
<6-5,Sheldon>What are you trying to pull here?

132
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,170
<6-6,Alex>-不  我只是觉得这个  -下一个
<6-6,Alex>- No, I just thought it would be... - Next.

133
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,920
<6-7,Sheldon>好吧
<6-7,Sheldon>Okay.

134
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,930
<6-8,Alex>我知道她很喜欢《坎特伯雷故事集》
<6-8,Alex>Um, I know she's a fan of The Canterbury Tales,

136
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,150
<6-9,Sheldon>所以我找到了
<6-9,Sheldon>so I found...

137
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,120
<6-10,Alex>这张很酷的地图
<6-10,Alex>this cool map

138
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,410
<6-10,Alex>上面标明了书中人物在英国的旅行路线
<6-10,Alex>that illustrates the characters' journey through England.

139
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,910
<6-10,Alex>我们可以选个漂亮的框子裱起来
<6-10,Alex>I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.

140
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,890
<6-11,Sheldon>但她的手机里装了谷歌地图
<6-11,Sheldon>But she's got Google Maps on her phone.

141
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,290
<6-12,Alex>我词穷了
<6-12,Alex>I don't know how to respond to that.

142
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,870
<6-13,Sheldon>我希望还有第三个不错的选择
<6-13,Sheldon>Well, I hope it's with a third good option,

143
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,790
<6-13,Sheldon>这前两个也太逊了
<6-13,Sheldon>because these first two... blah.

144
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,070
<6-13,Sheldon>好吧
<6-13,Sheldon>Okay.

145
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,560
<6-14,Alex>幸运的是  我把最好的留在最后了
<6-14,Alex>Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last.

146
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,150
<6-14,Alex>艾米是个神经学家
<6-14,Alex>Since Amy's a neuroscientist,

147
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,960
<6-14,Alex>我做了点调查  发现
<6-14,Alex>I did some research and found out

148
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
<6-14,Alex>圣地亚哥·拉蒙尼·卡哈尔
<6-14,Alex>that Santiago Ramony Cajal,

149

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,710
<6-14,Alex>曾绘制过许多脑细胞的手绘图
<6-14,Alex>did lots of hand drawings of brain cells.

151
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,320
<6-14,Alex>而我想办法拿到了
<6-14,Alex>And I managed to find

152
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,640
<6-14,Alex>这幅有其签名的版本
<6-14,Alex>this signed print.

153

156
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,250
<6-18,Alex>那你的女朋友呢
<6-18,Alex>What about your girlfriend?

157

<7-11,Howard>我们今晚还是可以开开心心的
<7-11,Howard>Look, we can still have a nice night.

<7-11,Howard>告诉我在哪就行了
<7-11,Howard>Just tell me where it is.

<7-12,Bernadette>你要是能说到做到  我就会告诉你了
<7-12,Bernadette>Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I'd tell you.

171
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,270
<7-13,Leonard>什么东西在哪
<7-13,Leonard>Uh, where what is?

172
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,820
<7-14,Howard>她像对付小孩一样  把我的游戏机藏起来了
<7-14,Howard>She hid my XBOX like I'm a child.

173
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,110
<7-14,Howard>那可是我妈妈给我的生日礼物
<7-14,Howard>Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday,

174
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,280
<7-14,Howard>你要是不还给我  我就告状去
<7-14,Howard>so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.

175
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,110
<7-15,Bernadette>我每天都工作到很晚
<7-15,Bernadette>I've been working late every night.

176
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,040
<7-15,Bernadette>我只不过是要求他
<7-15,Bernadette>All I asked was that he

177
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,010
<7-15,Bernadette>把家里收拾干净  洗一次衣服
<7-15,Bernadette>clean the apartment and do one load of laundry.

178
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,050
<7-15,Bernadette>但他做了吗  没有
<7-15,Bernadette>But did he do it? No.

179
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,220
<7-15,Bernadette>他就那么心安理得地玩那蠢游戏
<7-15,Bernadette>He just kept on playing that stupid game.

180
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,540
<7-15,Bernadette>你这么喜欢按按钮
<7-15,Bernadette>You like pushing buttons so much,

181
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,910
<7-15,Bernadette>干嘛不按按洗衣机的按钮
<7-15,Bernadette>try pushing them on the washing machine.

182
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,310
<7-16,Howard>我道过歉了
<7-16,Howard>I said I'm sorry.

183
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,960
<7-17,Bernadette>道歉可洗不了我的内裤  哥们
<7-17,Bernadette>Sorry doesn't clean my underpants, buddy.

184
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,460
<7-18,Howard>我跟你说过了  翻过来穿就行了
<7-18,Howard>I told you, turn them inside out.

185
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,340
<7-19,Bernadette>然后我说我不愿意你奈我何
<7-19,Bernadette>And I told you to bite me.

186
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,330
<7-20,Leonard>我们还想度过美好时光呢
<7-20,Leonard>Trying to have a magical night here, guys.

<7-23,Penny>没什么
<7-23,Penny>Nothing. Nothing.

189
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,920
<7-24,Leonard>说嘛
<7-24,Leonard>No, tell me.

190
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,460
<7-25,Penny>那是我的前男友
<7-25,Penny>It's just this guy I used to date.

191
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,780
<7-27,Penny>后来他背着我和我的朋友格雷琴偷腥
<7-27,Penny>Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen,

192
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,850
<7-27,Penny>也就是和他在一起那女的
<7-27,Penny>who's here with him now.

193
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,290
<7-28,Leonard>不是吧
<7-28,Leonard>You're kidding.

194
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,150
<7-29,Penny>她好像瘦了不少  可恶
<7-29,Penny>And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.

195
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,260
<7-30,Leonard>我知道他们的出现让你不开心
<7-30,Leonard>I know it's not ideal,

196
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,810
<7-30,Leonard>但没必要让他们毁了我们的夜晚
<7-30,Leonard>but don't let them ruin our night.

197
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,620
<7-31,Penny>对  你说得对
<7-31,Penny>No, you're totally right.

198
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,760
<7-31,Penny>她可能是因为快死了所以这么瘦
<7-31,Penny>She could be skinny 'cause she's dying.

199
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,810
<7-32,Leonard>这么想就对了
<7-32,Leonard>That's the spirit.

200
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,130
<7-33,Penny>管他们的呢
<7-33,Penny>You know what, screw them.

201
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,450
<7-33,Penny>我们的夜晚会比他们的难忘许多
<7-33,Penny>Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.

202
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,890
<7-34,Leonard>对
<7-34,Leonard>Yeah.

203

204
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,280
<7-36,Penny>逗姐玩呢是吧
<7-36,Penny>Oh, you got to be kidding me.

205
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,350
<7-37,Gretchen>天啊  我愿意
<7-37,Gretchen>Oh, my God, yes.

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,340
<7-37,Gretchen>我愿意嫁给你
<7-37,Gretchen>Of course I'll marry you.

207
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,920
<7-38,Leonard>谁说我们不行了
<7-38,Leonard>Two can play this game.

208
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,670
<7-39,Penny>-佩妮  -给我起来
<7-39,Penny>- Penny... - Get up.

209
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,040
<7-40,Leonard>好
<7-40,Leonard>All right.

210
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,840
<8-1,Raj>所有在情人节没有伴侣的单身人士
<8-1,Raj>It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day

00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,800
<8-1,Raj>能来这里聚聚真好

<8-2,Stuart>Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.

213
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,320
<8-2,Stuart>事实上  我就想待在这里  哪也不想去
<8-2,Stuart>In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.

214
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,920
<8-3,Raj>除非有任何人愿意和你约会
<8-3,Raj>Except on a date with anybody.

215
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
<8-4,Stuart>真的任何人都可以
<8-4,Stuart>Literally anybody.

216
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,670
<8-5,Raj>我们在一起总是很开心
<8-5,Raj>You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out.

217
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,570
<8-5,Raj>如果你是个女孩的话
<8-5,Raj>If you were a girl,

218
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,590
<8-5,Raj>我们所有问题就迎刃而解了
<8-5,Raj>all our problems would be solved.

219
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,700
<8-6,Stuart>什么
<8-6,Stuart>What?

220
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,790
<8-7,Raj>你仔细想想
<8-7,Raj>Oh, yeah, think about it.

221
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,260
<8-7,Raj>我们可以总在一起玩
<8-7,Raj>We'd hang out,

222
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,660
<8-7,Raj>可以一起看漫画  一起看电影
<8-7,Raj>we'd read comic books, we'd see movies.

223
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,590
<8-7,Raj>这算得上是世间最美妙的关系了
<8-7,Raj>It'd be like the best relationship ever.

224
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,080
<8-8,Stuart>听起来是挺好的
<8-8,Stuart>That does sound nice.

225
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,760
<8-9,Raj>然后我送你回家  脱下你的小黑裙
<8-9,Raj>Then I'd take you home, slip off your little black dress

226
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,840
<8-9,Raj>把你搞到七晕八素分不清南北
<8-9,Raj>and just pile-drive you into oblivion.

227
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,210
<8-9,Raj>什么
<8-9,Raj>What?

228
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,930
<9-1,Penny>真不敢相信
<9-1,Penny>Oh, I can't believe

229
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,410
<9-1,Penny>他要和破坏我们感情的小三结婚了
<9-1,Penny>he's going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.

230
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,750
<9-2,Leonard>这不是挺美好的吗
<9-2,Leonard>Isn't it kind of nice?

231
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,150
<9-2,Leonard>他曾经爱上了错误的对象
<9-2,Leonard>I mean, he was with the wrong person,

232
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,530
<9-2,Leonard>如今终于找到他的真爱
<9-2,Leonard>and now he found the right person.

233
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,120
<9-3,Penny>怎么  我成了错误的对象吗
<9-3,Penny>What, so I'm the wrong person?

234
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,880
<9-3,Penny>那你是不是也想和格雷琴在一起啊
<9-3,Penny>Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.

235
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,180
<9-4,Bernadette>他们看起来挺开心的
<9-4,Bernadette>They do look happy.

236
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,360
<9-5,Howard>就算是今晚开心
<9-5,Howard>Yeah, maybe tonight.

237
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,350
<9-5,Howard>但一年以后  他就会
<9-5,Howard>But a year from now, he'll be

238
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,090
<9-5,Howard>潜伏在水槽底下摸寻他的游戏机了
<9-5,Howard>crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox.

239
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,050
<9-5,Howard>他肯定会的
<9-5,Howard>Well, he will.

240
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,200
<9-6,Leonard>算了吧  何不忘掉他们
<9-6,Leonard>You know what? Why don't we just forget about them

241
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,140
<9-6,Leonard>好好享受我们自己的情人节
<9-6,Leonard>and enjoy our Valentine's Day?

242
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,380
<9-7,Penny>好的  没问题
<9-7,Penny>Yes, absolutely.

243
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,750
<9-7,Penny>现在他们居然玩那种假到爆的
<9-7,Penny>Now they're doing that phony

244
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,120
<9-7,Penny>交杯酒把戏
<9-7,Penny>link-arm-drink thingy.

245
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
<9-7,Penny>这一招还是我教他的呢
<9-7,Penny>I totally taught him that.

246
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,850
<9-8,Leonard>我以为我们说好不管他们了
<9-8,Leonard>I thought we were letting it go.

247
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,000
<9-9,Penny>当然  只是  这太不公平了  好吗
<9-9,Penny>We were; it's just... it's not fair, okay?

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,280
<9-9,Penny>他们不是什么好人
<9-9,Penny>They're bad people.

249
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,610
<9-9,Penny>不配拥有幸福大结局
<9-9,Penny>It's not supposed to end happy for them;

250
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,740
<9-9,Penny>明明应该是我找到最后的幸福
<9-9,Penny>it's supposed to end happy for me.

251
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,430
<9-10,Leonard>你已经找到你的幸福了啊
<9-10,Leonard>It did end happy for you.

252
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,300
<9-10,Leonard>你现在和我在一起
<9-10,Leonard>You're here with me.

<9-11,Penny>是  是  我知道
<9-11,Penny>Yeah, yeah, I know.

254
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,170
<9-12,Leonard>你这么敷衍的样子  很难不让我受伤
<9-12,Leonard>Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.

255
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,630
<9-13,Penny>得了  别又扯到你身上去了
<9-13,Penny>Oh, come on, don't make this about you.

256
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,390
<9-14,Leonard>不是我  这是你的问题
<9-14,Leonard>Oh, I'm not. It's about you.

257
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,560
<9-15,Penny>随便怎么都好  行吗
<9-15,Penny>Yeah, well, whatever, okay?

258
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,190
<9-15,Penny>我告诉过你  情人节就没好事
<9-15,Penny>I told you, Valentine's Day sucks.

259
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,550
<9-16,Leonard>这个情人节不好过  而你就是罪魁祸首
<9-16,Leonard>This one does, and you're the reason why.

260
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,890
<9-17,Penny>什么
<9-17,Penny>What?

261
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,800
<9-18,Bernadette>和他们比起来
<9-18,Bernadette>You know, compared to them,

262
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,780
<9-18,Bernadette>我觉得我们俩还过得挺不错的
<9-18,Bernadette>I'm feeling pretty good about us.

263
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,720
<9-19,Howard>我也这么觉得
<9-19,Howard>Me, too.

264
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,570
<9-19,Howard>不如我们不吃甜点  早点回家
<9-19,Howard>How about we blow off dessert, go home early...

265
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,960
<9-19,Howard>然后我把衣服都洗了
<9-19,Howard>I'll do that laundry.

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,490
<9-23,Howard>你到底把游戏机藏哪里了
<9-23,Howard>So where'd you hide it?

270
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,620
<9-24,Bernadette>你永远想不到去看的地方
<9-24,Bernadette>Where you'd never look.

271
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,420
<9-25,Howard>见鬼  原来是藏在洗衣机里了
<9-25,Howard>Damn it, it's in the washing machine.

277
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,740
<10-5,Amy>等一下
<10-5,Amy>Hang on.

278
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,320
<10-5,Amy>你知道  我原本计划了传统式的浪漫之夜
<10-5,Amy>As you know, I had planned a traditional evening

279
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,240
<10-5,Amy>还有互赠礼物
<10-5,Amy>dort dort dort of romance and gifts.

280
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,950
<10-5,Amy>是的
<10-5,Amy>Yes,

281
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,090
<10-6,Sheldon>而你也知道
<10-6,Sheldon>and as you know,

282
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,680
<10-6,Sheldon>我计划全程假装乐在其中
<10-6,Sheldon>I planned to pretend to enjoy it.

283
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,560
<10-6,Sheldon>我已经练习这种面部表情一整天了
<10-6,Sheldon>I've been working on this facial expression all day.

284
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,410
<10-7,Amy>我感谢你的努力
<10-7,Amy>And I appreciate your effort,

285
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,930
<10-7,Amy>但仔细一想
<10-7,Amy>but upon contemplation,

286
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,170
<10-7,Amy>我觉得自己太自私了
<10-7,Amy>I decided I was being selfish.

287
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,350
<10-7,Amy>所以  我取消了晚餐订位
<10-7,Amy>So, I canceled our dinner reservations

288
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,860
<10-7,Amy>想到了另一个更好的办法
<10-7,Amy>and came up with an even better way

289
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,100
<10-7,Amy>来庆祝情人节
<10-7,Amy>to celebrate Valentine's Day.

290
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,300
<10-8,Sheldon>什么办法
<10-8,Sheldon>What is that?

291
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,960
<10-9,Amy>就是什么都不干
<10-9,Amy>By doing none of it--

292
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,810
<10-9,Amy>不吃什么晚餐
<10-9,Amy>no dinner,

293
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,760
<10-9,Amy>不要什么浪漫  不送任何礼物
<10-9,Amy>no romance, no gifts.

294
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,340
<10-9,Amy>我们留在家里  点个披萨外送
<10-9,Amy>We stay here, order a pizza

295
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,070
<10-9,Amy>看一部你最爱的
<10-9,Amy>and watch one of your beloved

296
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,380
<10-9,Amy>星际大战之类的片子
<10-9,Amy>Star War Trek things.

297
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,140
<10-10,Sheldon>你说真的吗
<10-10,Sheldon>Really?

298
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,390
<10-11,Amy>这才是你真心最爱的  不是吗
<10-11,Amy>Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?

299
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,000
<10-12,Sheldon>胜过世上的一切
<10-12,Sheldon>More than anything.

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,390
<10-13,Amy>好吧
<10-13,Amy>Well, then...

301
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,280
<10-13,Amy>那我们就这么做吧
<10-13,Amy>that's what we're going to do.

302
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,890
<10-14,Sheldon>我不知该说什么了
<10-14,Sheldon>Well... I don't know what to say.

303
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,410
<10-14,Sheldon>这可是我收到过的所有礼物中
<10-14,Sheldon>This is the most thoughtful gift

304
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,430
<10-14,Sheldon>最有心的一件了
<10-14,Sheldon>that anyone's ever given me.

305
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,170
<10-14,Sheldon>比我上午送给自己的

306
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,470
<10-14,Sheldon>一件超级棒的礼物还要好
<10-14,Sheldon>that I gave myself earlier today.

307
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,840
<10-14,Sheldon>我是你的女朋友  这是我的责任
<10-14,Sheldon>I'm your girlfriend. That's my job.

308
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,070
<10-15,Amy>我知道挑礼物这事总是让你倍感压力
<10-15,Amy>And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you,

309
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,010
<10-15,Amy>所以不管你准备了什么给我  你都可以退掉它
<10-15,Amy>so whatever you got me, you can return.

311

<11-1,Penny>You know what?

333
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,280
<11-2,Leonard>你刚才真够差劲的
<11-2,Leonard>That was pretty crappy of you.

334
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,880
<11-2,Leonard>我只想给你一个浪漫的情人之夜
<11-2,Leonard>I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night,

335
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,630
<11-2,Leonard>而你却竭尽所能地搞破坏
<11-2,Leonard>and it's like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.

336
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,770
<11-2,Leonard>没错
<11-2,Leonard>Yeah, I know.

337
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,740
<11-3,Penny>我就是一个贱人
<11-3,Penny>I'm a total bitch.

338
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,530
<11-4,Leonard>-我没这么说  -我是的
<11-4,Leonard>- I'm not saying that. - Well, I am.

<11-6,Leonard>好吧  拗不过你  你是贱人
<11-6,Leonard>Fine, you win. You're a bitch.

340
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,930
<11-6,Leonard>我们为什么不能好好过一个情人节
<11-6,Leonard>Why couldn't we just have a nice time?

341
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,550
<11-6,Leonard>我不知道
<11-6,Leonard>I don't know.

342
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,640
<11-7,Penny>也许是因为最近我们进展太顺利了
<11-7,Penny>Maybe 'cause things are going so well between us lately

343
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,880
<11-7,Penny>我真的很开心
<11-7,Penny>and I've been really happy.

344
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,200
<11-8,Leonard>好吧  你这解释让我更混乱了
<11-8,Leonard>Okay, you're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.

345
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,780
<11-9,Penny>显然  我有承诺恐惧症
<11-9,Penny>Obviously, I have some commitment issues.

346
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,720
<11-10,Leonard>有眼睛的人都看得出来  继续说
<11-10,Leonard>Glaringly obvious. Go on.

347
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,250
<11-11,Penny>只要我们继续顺利交往下去
<11-11,Penny>As long as things keep going great between us,

348
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,640
<11-11,Penny>你会不断向我求婚
<11-11,Penny>you'll keep asking me to marry you,

349
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,240
<11-11,Penny>最终我会答应
<11-11,Penny>and eventually I'm gonna end up saying yes,

350
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,910
<11-11,Penny>然后我们就会天长地久
<11-11,Penny>and then we're gonna be married forever,

351
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,830
<11-11,Penny>整件事让我想起来就头皮发麻
<11-11,Penny>and the whole thing just freaks me out.

352
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,100
<11-11,Penny>好吧
<11-11,Penny>Okay.

353
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,510
<11-12,Leonard>我知道我这人有喜欢求婚的毛病
<11-12,Leonard>I know I propose a lot.

354
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,840
<11-12,Leonard>你看这样行不行
<11-12,Leonard>So how about this?

355
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,430
<11-12,Leonard>我发誓  我再也不会向你求婚
<11-12,Leonard>I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.

356
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,410
<11-13,Penny>你这是什么意思
<11-13,Penny>What... what do you mean?

357
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,650
<11-13,Penny>你是要和我分手吗
<11-13,Penny>Are you breaking up with me?

358
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,420
<11-14,Leonard>不
<11-14,Leonard>No.

359
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,330
<11-14,Leonard>不是的
<11-14,Leonard>No, no, no, no.

360
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,700
<11-14,Leonard>但如果有一天你想结婚
<11-14,Leonard>But if someday you decide you want to get married,

361
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,650
<11-14,Leonard>你得向我求婚
<11-14,Leonard>you have to propose to me.

362
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,220
<11-15,Penny>-真的吗  -是的
<11-15,Penny>- Really? - Yes.

363
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,950
<11-16,Leonard>主动权在你
<11-16,Leonard>It's all on you.

364
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,980
<11-16,Leonard>不过我得提醒你  真到了那个时候
<11-16,Leonard>But I got to tell you, when the time comes,

365
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,910
<11-16,Leonard>你一点也不能含糊
<11-16,Leonard>I want the whole nine yards.

366
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,190
<11-16,Leonard>你得给我单膝跪地  满地鲜花
<11-16,Leonard>I want you down on one knee, flowers.

367
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,560
<11-16,Leonard>你得把我哄得芳心犹如小鹿乱撞
<11-16,Leonard>I want to be swept off my feet.

368
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,390
<11-17,Penny>没问题
<11-17,Penny>Yeah, you got it.

369
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
<11-18,Leonard>我不反对来个惊喜
<11-18,Leonard>And I'm cool with surprises.

370
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,450
<11-18,Leonard>但千万别来个大屏幕求婚
<11-18,Leonard>But nothing on a Jumbotron.

371
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,330
<11-18,Leonard>我不想满球场的人看着我泪如雨下
<11-18,Leonard>I don't want to cry on a big screen like that.

372
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,970
<11-18,Leonard>好的
<11-18,Leonard>Okay.

373
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,450
<11-19,Penny>知道吗
<11-19,Penny>You know what?

374
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,330
<11-19,Penny>可能酒劲上来了
<11-19,Penny>This might be the wine talking,

375
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,380
<11-19,Penny>我有个非常重要的问题问你
<11-19,Penny>but I have a very important question to ask you.

376
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,440
<11-20,Leonard>是吗
<11-20,Leonard>You do?

377
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,080
<11-21,Penny>莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
<11-21,Penny>Leonard Hofstadter...

378
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,390
<11-22,Leonard>什么事
<11-22,Leonard>Yes?

379
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,500
<11-23,Penny>你愿做我今夜的情人吗
<11-23,Penny>...will you be my valentine?

380
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,570
<11-24,Leonard>抱歉  咱们明年再说吧
<11-24,Leonard>Sorry. Maybe next year.

381
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,140
<11-24,Leonard>开个玩笑
<11-24,Leonard>I'm just kidding!

382
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,610
<11-24,Leonard>浪漫忍者杀到  咱上床去吧
<11-24,Leonard>Romance ninja. Let's have sex!

383
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,060
<12-1,Nerdy guy>多谢你们办这场派对
<12-1,Nerdy guy>Thank you, guys, for doing this.

384
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,800
<12-2,Raj>很高兴你能来
<12-2,Raj>We're glad you could make it.

385
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,810
<12-3,Nerdy guy>通常我在情人节这天是悲伤寂寞的
<12-3,Nerdy guy>Usually I spend Valentine's Day sad and alone.

386
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,720
<12-3,Nerdy guy>今年  我只是悲伤而已
<12-3,Nerdy guy>This year, I'm just sad.

387
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,800
<12-4,Raj>你说这个节日怎么就令大家这么不开心呢
<12-4,Raj>What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?

388
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,750
<12-4,Raj>就是说啊
<12-4,Raj>I know.

389
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,390
<12-5,Stuart>大多数时候  我都挺讨厌自己的
<12-5,Stuart>I hate myself most of the time,

390
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,800
<12-5,Stuart>但今晚  我知道其他人也好不到哪里去
<12-5,Stuart>but tonight's the night I know everyone else does, too.

391
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,730
<12-6,Nerdy guy>我觉得你挺酷的
<12-6,Nerdy guy>I think you're cool.

392
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,040
<12-7,Stuart>多谢你看得起
<12-7,Stuart>Great.

393
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,820
<12-7,Stuart>我跟你们说
<12-7,Stuart>I got to tell you,

394
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,720
<12-8,Raj>我们不能再这样自我折磨了
<12-8,Raj>we've got to stop beating ourselves up like this.

395
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,150
<12-8,Raj>各位  不好意思
<12-8,Raj>Excuse me, everybody.

396
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,430
<12-8,Raj>请大家听我说几句
<12-8,Raj>Can I have your attention, please?

397
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,030
<12-8,Raj>今晚我们齐聚一堂是因为
<12-8,Raj>We're all here tonight because...

398
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,070
<12-8,Raj>我们没有另一半相陪
<12-8,Raj>we have no one to be with.

399
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,960
<12-8,Raj>但这样并不代表我们是异种
<12-8,Raj>But... that doesn't make us mutants.

400
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,670
<12-8,Raj>这里真正的异种全在漫画书里
<12-8,Raj>The only mutants here are in these comic books.

401
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,520
<12-8,Raj>我们不能再以是否有恋爱对象
<12-8,Raj>We've got to stop defining our self-worth

402
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,550
<12-8,Raj>来定义我们的自我价值
<12-8,Raj>by whether or not we're in a relationship.

403
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,360
<12-8,Raj>知道我放眼过去看到什么吗
<12-8,Raj>You know what I see when I look around?

404
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,570
<12-8,Raj>我看到一屋子了不起的人
<12-8,Raj>I see a room full of great people.

405
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,710
<12-8,Raj>我们别再跟自己过不去了
<12-8,Raj>So let's give ourselves a break.

406
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,180
<12-8,Raj>我们是一个联盟
<12-8,Raj>We are a community,

407
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,650
<12-8,Raj>只要我们团结在一起
<12-8,Raj>and as long as we have each other,

408
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,800
<12-8,Raj>我们就不是寂寞的
<12-8,Raj>we're never truly alone.

409
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,590
<12-9,Girl>真是不错
<12-9,Girl>That was cool.

410
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,060
<12-9,Girl>你说的那些话
<12-9,Girl>What you said.

411
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,660
<12-10,Raj>你真这样想吗
<12-10,Raj>You really think so?

412
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,910
<12-11,Girl>是的
<12-11,Girl>Yeah, I do.

413
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,230
<12-11,Girl>谢谢
<12-11,Girl>Thank you.

414
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,980
<12-12,Raj>你想不想
<12-12,Raj>Would you like to, uh...

415
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,210
<12-12,Raj>去喝杯咖啡
<12-12,Raj>get a cup... A cup of coffee or...?

416
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,860
<12-13,Girl>好的
<12-13,Girl>Okay.

417
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,190
<12-14,Raj>哥先走一步了  废柴联盟
<12-14,Raj>Later, losers!

418
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,090
<12-14,Raj>喂
<12-14,Raj>Hello?

419
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,200
<13-1,Amy>又是急诊
<13-1,Amy>Another medical emergency?

420
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,040
<13-1,Amy>这次他又怎么了
<13-1,Amy>What's wrong with him now?

421
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,430
<13-1,Amy>我严重怀疑他是不是真被虎纹捕鸟蛛咬了
<13-1,Amy>I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider.

423
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,760
<13-1,Amy>一个肿块怎么可能有亚洲感
<13-1,Amy>How exactly does a bump feel Asian?

424
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,570
<13-1,Amy>让他接电话
<13-1,Amy>Just put him on the phone.

425
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,950
<13-1,Amy>谢尔顿  我不会再开车过去了
<13-1,Amy>Sheldon, I am not driving over there again.

426
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,720
<13-1,Amy>因为我昨天开车去了
<13-1,Amy>Because I drove over there yesterday

427
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,210
<13-1,Amy>你说得了脑瘤  结果却是
<13-1,Amy>for a brain tumor that turned out to be

428
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,960
<13-1,Amy>冰淇淋吃快了导致头痛
<13-1,Amy>an ice cream headache.

429
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,810
<13-1,Amy>是的  我依然想做你的紧急联系人
<13-1,Amy>Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact.

430
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,710
<13-1,Amy>是的  你可以吃冰淇淋吃得过快
<13-1,Amy>Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast

431
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,960
<13-1,Amy>同时又有脑瘤
<13-1,Amy>and also have a brain tumor.

432
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,680
<13-1,Amy>我马上来
<13-1,Amy>I'm on my way.

433
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,610
<13-1,Amy>真是脑瘤很多事情就说得通了
<13-1,Amy>Brain tumor would explain a lot.
