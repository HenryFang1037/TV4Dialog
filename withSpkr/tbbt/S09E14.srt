1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,280
<1-1,Sheldon>有趣邮政小知识
<1-1,Sheldon>Oh, here's a fun postal fact.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,260
<1-1,Sheldon>邮箱的内部是受联邦政府管辖
<1-1,Sheldon>The inside of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction,

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,460
<1-1,Sheldon>所以如果你伤了我的右拇指
<1-1,Sheldon>so if you broke my right thumb,

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,100
<1-1,Sheldon>是帕萨迪纳市警局抓你
<1-1,Sheldon>that's the Pasadena City Police.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,080
<1-1,Sheldon>但如果你此时伤了我的左拇指
<1-1,Sheldon>But if you broke my left thumb,

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,220
<1-1,Sheldon>那就是联邦调查局抓你
<1-1,Sheldon>that's the FBI.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,080
<1-2,Leonard>如果我真要犯事入狱
<1-2,Leonard>If I'm going to jail,

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,650
<1-2,Leonard>那怎么也得杀了他  而不是伤他拇指
<1-2,Leonard>I'm killing him, not breaking his thumb.

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,660
<1-3,Penny>没错
<1-3,Penny>Yeah.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,890
<1-4,Sheldon>我收到我姥姥给我寄的信
<1-4,Sheldon>I got a letter from my meemaw.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,690
<1-4,Sheldon>闻闻
<1-4,Sheldon>Smell this.

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,270
<1-5,Penny>什么味道
<1-5,Penny>What is that?

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,370
<1-6,Sheldon>玫瑰  酸痛药膏  脚气药粉
<1-6,Sheldon>Uh, roses, Bengay and Dr. Scholl's Foot Powder.

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,830
<1-7,Penny>CK牌姥姥味香水
<1-7,Penny>Yep. Grandma By Calvin Klein.

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,050
<1-7,Penny>我上一次收到手写的信
<1-7,Penny>You know, the last time I got a handwritten letter

16
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,550
<1-7,Penny>是某人投诉我停车技术像瞎子
<1-7,Penny>was from someone who told me I park like a blind person.

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,040
<1-8,Leonard>那个某人有名字的好吗
<1-8,Leonard>That someone has a name.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,580
<1-8,Leonard>谢谢
<1-8,Leonard>Uh, thank you.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,840
<1-9,Sheldon>姥姥弄了一副新假牙
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,300
<1-9,Sheldon>可后来她又找到她旧的那副了
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, but then she found her old ones.

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,890
<1-9,Sheldon>所以新的就成了她上教堂专用假牙
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, so, now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,600
<1-10,Leonard>有意思
<1-10,Leonard>Fun.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,090
<1-10,Leonard>就像你的漫展史波克耳朵
<1-10,Leonard>Like your Comic-Con Spock ears,

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,340
<1-10,Leonard>跟在家戴的史波克耳朵一样
<1-10,Leonard>and your around-the-house Spock ears.

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,340
<1-11,Penny>我停车技术明明还行
<1-11,Penny>I park fine.

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,650
<1-12,Sheldon>天啊  她要来看我
<1-12,Sheldon>Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!

27
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,090
<1-13,Leonard>很好啊  终于能见到她本人
<1-13,Leonard>Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.

28
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,910
<1-14,Sheldon>你们绝对会爱死她
<1-14,Sheldon>Oh, you are going to love her.

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,130
<1-14,Sheldon>她会是你们见过最善良最贴心的女人
<1-14,Sheldon>She is the kindest, sweetest woman you'll ever meet.

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,680
<1-14,Sheldon>除非你是挖她菜园的地鼠
<1-14,Sheldon>Yeah, unless you're a gopher digging up her vegetable garden.

31
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,250
<1-14,Sheldon>那样的话  就等着
<1-14,Sheldon>In that case, you can expect

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,290
<1-14,Sheldon>脑袋被她用铲子打爆吧
<1-14,Sheldon>to have your head bashed in with a shovel.

33
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,930
<1-14,Sheldon>翻译：恭喜发财赛太公  红包拿给YY猫
<1-14,Sheldon>猫中之王  别扭大菜

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,250
<2-1,Sheldon>不是她  不是她
<2-1,Sheldon>That's not her. That's not her.

44
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,720
<2-1,Sheldon>这也不是她  不是她
<2-1,Sheldon>That's not her. That's not her.

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,290
<2-1,Sheldon>不是她
<2-1,Sheldon>That's not her.

46
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,670
<2-1,Sheldon>不是她  不是她
<2-1,Sheldon>That's not her. That's not her.

47
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,750
<2-1,Sheldon>那也不是她
<2-1,Sheldon>That's not her.

48
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,370
<2-1,Sheldon>真的吗
<2-1,Sheldon>dort dort dort Really?

49
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,180
<2-2,Leonard>那个亚洲老头不是你姥姥吗
<2-2,Leonard>The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,640
<2-3,Sheldon>你这话也没有帮助
<2-3,Sheldon>And that's not helpful.

51
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,530
<2-3,Sheldon>我圣诞节时送了她个苹果手机
<2-3,Sheldon>You know, I-I got her an iPhone for Christmas.

52
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,850
<2-3,Sheldon>我查看一下她的地点
<2-3,Sheldon>I'll see where she is.

53
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,740
<2-3,Sheldon>那挺不错呀
<2-3,Sheldon>Oh, that's nice.

54
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,830
<2-4,Leonard>她那个年纪的大多数人都不愿意接受新科技
<2-4,Leonard>Most people her age don't embrace technology.

55
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,510
<2-5,Sheldon>她自己不知道她有苹果手机
<2-5,Sheldon>Oh, no, she doesn't even know she has it.

56
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,980
<2-5,Sheldon>我让我姐塞进她的包里
<2-5,Sheldon>No, I had my sister slip it in her bag

57
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,400
<2-5,Sheldon>这样我就能追踪海龟一样追踪她
<2-5,Sheldon>so that I can track her like a sea turtle.

58
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,360
<2-6,Leonard>就像我们在动物园弄丢你时一样
<2-6,Leonard>Same as when we lost you at the zoo.

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,690
<2-7,Sheldon>我都说几百次了
<2-7,Sheldon>Uh, for the hundredth time,

60
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,880
<2-7,Sheldon>我闻到爆米花的味道  但找不到摊位
<2-7,Sheldon>I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.

61
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,410
<2-8,Leonard>但还是解释不了
<2-8,Leonard>Still doesn't explain

62
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,250
<2-8,Leonard>你最后怎么跑上高速分隔带上
<2-8,Leonard>how you ended up on the freeway divider.

63
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,540
<2-9,Meemaw>小甜饼
<2-9,Meemaw>Moon Pie!

64
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,800
<2-9,Meemaw>姥姥
<2-9,Meemaw>Meemaw!

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,300
<2-10,Sheldon>我好高兴看到你
<2-10,Sheldon>I'm so happy to see you!

66
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,860
<2-11,Meemaw>我也很高兴看到你啊
<2-11,Meemaw>I'm so happy to see you, too!

67
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,750
<2-12,Sheldon>你变得更小个了
<2-12,Sheldon>You got even smaller.

68
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,140
<2-12,Sheldon>我喜欢
<2-12,Sheldon>I love it!

69
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,290
<2-12,Sheldon>姥姥  这位是莱纳德
<2-12,Sheldon>Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard.

70
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,710
<2-12,Sheldon>莱纳德  这是我姥姥
<2-12,Sheldon>Leonard, this is my Meemaw.

71
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,450
<2-13,Leonard>您好  很高兴终于见到您了
<2-13,Leonard>Hi. So nice to finally meet you.

72
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,990
<2-13,Leonard>姥姥  让我来帮您拿行李吧
<2-13,Leonard>Let me take this for you, Meemaw.

73
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,650
<2-14,Meemaw>谢谢
<2-14,Meemaw>Thank you.

74
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,610
<2-15,Sheldon>别乱叫  你只能叫她"康斯坦丝"
<2-15,Sheldon>No. Oh, no. Now you call her "Constance."

75
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,940
<2-15,Sheldon>我才能叫她"姥姥"
<2-15,Sheldon>I call her "Meemaw."

76
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,370
<2-15,Sheldon>你自己有你自己的姥姥
<2-15,Sheldon>You have your own Meemaw.

77
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,550
<2-15,Sheldon>你四岁时她就去世了可不是我的错
<2-15,Sheldon>It's not my fault she died when you were four.

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,070
<2-16,Meemaw>这么对朋友说话合适吗
<2-16,Meemaw>Is that nice to say to your friend?

79
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,270
<2-17,Sheldon>不合适  姥姥
<2-17,Sheldon>It isn't, Meemaw.

80
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,860
<2-17,Sheldon>莱纳德  对不起
<2-17,Sheldon>Sorry, Leonard.

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,160
<2-18,Leonard>您能在我们那里长住下去吗
<2-18,Leonard>Can you please live with us forever?

82
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,050
<3-1,Howard>太扯了吧  如果你有超能力
<3-1,Howard>That's ridiculous! If you had a superpower,

83
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,930
<3-1,Howard>而且穷尽一生想将其压制住
<3-1,Howard>and spent your whole life being told to suppress it,

84
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,690
<3-1,Howard>当你最后决定要接受这能力了
<3-1,Howard>when you finally decide to embrace that power,

85
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,260
<3-1,Howard>为毛独自躲去荒山野岭
<3-1,Howard>why hide in isolation?!

86
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,260
<3-1,Howard>真是不好意思
<3-1,Howard>I'm sorry,

87
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,430
<3-2,Raj>请问你这版本的
<3-2,Raj>and how much money did

88
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,160
<3-2,Raj>《冰雪奇缘》赚了多少钱呢
<3-2,Raj>your version of Frozen make?!

89
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,620
<3-3,Howard>我只是认为
<3-3,Howard>I'm just saying,

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,240
<3-3,Howard>与其唱《随它吧》  她真正该唱的是
<3-3,Howard>instead of "Let it Go," She should really sing,

91
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,970
<3-3,Howard>《看我像根巧克力棒躲冰箱里》
<3-3,Howard>"Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar."

92
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,380
<3-4,Raj>她在一天里造了一座冰雪城堡  化雪成兵
<3-4,Raj>She built an ice castle, made a snow monster

93
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,380
<3-4,Raj>还将自己彻底改头换面
<3-4,Raj>and gave herself a complete makeover in one day.

94
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,860
<3-4,Raj>你知道你今天都干嘛了吗
<3-4,Raj>You know what I saw you do today?

95
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,170
<3-4,Raj>打开锡箔包装  直接吃了一整块奶油干酪
<3-4,Raj>Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil

96
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,490
<3-4,Raj>而且还对自己老婆隐瞒实情
<3-4,Raj>and lie about it to your wife!

97
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,530
<3-5,Girl>抱歉偷听到你们的对话  你们知道
<3-5,Girl>Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know

98
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,480
<3-5,Girl>他们是先有《随它吧》这首歌
<3-5,Girl>they actually had the song "Let It Go" in place

99
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,560
<3-5,Girl>之后才定下完整故事的吗
<3-5,Girl>before they finalized the story?

100
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,230
<3-6,Raj>这是真的
<3-6,Raj>Yeah, that's true.

101
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,660
<3-6,Raj>其实  他们因为太爱这首歌
<3-6,Raj>In fact, they liked the song so much,

102
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,330
<3-6,Raj>他们把修改剧本来配这首歌
<3-6,Raj>they retooled the whole script around it.

103
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,500
<3-7,Girl>这也是为啥这部片这么烂
<3-7,Girl>Which is probably why that movie sucks.

104
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,520
<3-8,Howard>我们在这聊"冰雪"
<3-8,Howard>Here we are talking about Frozen,

105
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,240
<3-8,Howard>但你还被呛到火烧火燎
<3-8,Howard>and yet, you got burned.

106
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,690
<3-9,Raj>小姐  抱歉
<3-9,Raj>Miss, I'm so sorry.

107
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,740
<3-9,Raj>你怎么会不喜欢那部电影呢
<3-9,Raj>How can you not like that movie?

108
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,900
<3-10,Girl>我只是觉得它名过其实
<3-10,Girl>I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.

109
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,360
<3-11,Howard>我一小时前就这么说了
<3-11,Howard>Oh, that's what I said an hour ago.

110
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,140
<3-12,Girl>你们俩聊了一个小时《冰雪奇缘》吗
<3-12,Girl>Wow. You've been talking about Frozen for an hour?

111
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,110
<3-13,Howard>你应该听我们聊动画片《恐龙当家》
<3-13,Howard>You should've seen us after The Good Dinosaur.

112
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,630
<3-14,Raj>这是部设定在后侏罗纪时期的西部风格片
<3-14,Raj>It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period,

113
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,000
<3-14,Raj>它完全改变了我的人生
<3-14,Raj>and it changed my life.

114
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,270
<4-1,Sheldon>你舒服吗
<4-1,Sheldon>Are you comfortable?

115
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,250
<4-2,Meemaw>非常舒服
<4-2,Meemaw>Very.

116
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,920
<4-2,Meemaw>休息挺好的
<4-2,Meemaw>It's nice to rest

117
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,490
<4-2,Meemaw>尤其是在走完八百阶楼梯后
<4-2,Meemaw>after 800 flights of stairs.

118
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,870
<4-3,Sheldon>你刚才可爱死了  气喘吁吁
<4-3,Sheldon>You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'.

119
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,390
<4-3,Sheldon>艾米来了
<4-3,Sheldon>There's Amy.

120
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,140
<4-3,Sheldon>我要告诉你  你们绝对合得来
<4-3,Sheldon>I just know you're gonna hit it off.

121
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,580
<4-3,Sheldon>因为你俩的时尚品味一模一样
<4-3,Sheldon>You both have the same fashion sense.

122
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,710
<4-3,Sheldon>进来吧  跟姥姥请安
<4-3,Sheldon>Hello! Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.

123
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,190
<4-4,Amy>很高兴见到您
<4-4,Amy>Hi. Nice to meet you.

124
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,740
<4-5,Meemaw>我也是
<4-5,Meemaw>Nice to meet you, too.

125
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,830
<4-6,Amy>旅途还好吗
<4-6,Amy>How was your trip?

126
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,690
<4-7,Meemaw>非常棒
<4-7,Meemaw>Wonderful.

127
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,740
<4-7,Meemaw>机长技术非常好
<4-7,Meemaw>And the pilot did such a good job,

128
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,490
<4-7,Meemaw>我还送他一颗奶油糖
<4-7,Meemaw>I gave him a butterscotch.

129
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,360
<4-7,Meemaw>那太好了
<4-7,Meemaw>That's great.

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,490
<4-8,Amy>瞧瞧您  坐在谢尔顿的专座上
<4-8,Amy>And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot.

131
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,080
<4-8,Amy>-他从来都没让我坐过  -是啊
<4-8,Amy>- You know, I don't even get to sit there. - Yeah.

132
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,920
<4-9,Sheldon>你这辈子都没机会坐
<4-9,Sheldon>And you never will.

133
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,230
<4-9,Sheldon>对了  问她要纸巾
<4-9,Sheldon>Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing.

134
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,540
<4-9,Sheldon>去吧  问她
<4-9,Sheldon>Do it, ask her.

135
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,550
<4-10,Amy>能给我张纸巾吗
<4-10,Amy>Can I have a tissue?

136
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,840
<4-11,Meemaw>当然
<4-11,Meemaw>Of course.

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,670
<4-12,Sheldon>是不是超级棒
<4-12,Sheldon>Isn't that the best?!

138
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,240
<4-12,Sheldon>她就像蜘蛛侠奶奶
<4-12,Sheldon>She's like Grandma Spider-Man.

139
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,890
<4-13,Meemaw>他从小就这么说我
<4-13,Meemaw>He's been saying that since he was little.

140
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,750
<4-13,Meemaw>我到现在还不知道是什么意思
<4-13,Meemaw>I still don't know what it means.

141
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,450
<4-14,Sheldon>你们俩坐下好好了解彼此
<4-14,Sheldon>Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other.

142
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,780
<4-14,Sheldon>我去帮你准备好房间
<4-14,Sheldon>I'll get your room ready.

143
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,460
<4-15,Meemaw>你不许翻我的行李箱找礼物
<4-15,Meemaw>Oh, now don't you go looking through my suitcase for presents.

144
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,710
<4-16,Sheldon>如果我翻了  会找到礼物吗
<4-16,Sheldon>If I did, would I find any?

145
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,690
<4-16,Sheldon>或许吧
<4-16,Sheldon>Maybe.

146
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,020
<4-17,Meemaw>但你还会找到我的阿嬷胸罩和内裤
<4-17,Meemaw>But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,030
<4-18,Sheldon>我愿意冒这个险
<4-18,Sheldon>That's a risk I'm willing to take!

<4-19,Amy>这真是太好了

<4-19,Amy>He's so excited to have you here and...

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,930
<4-20,Meemaw>好了  我就不跟你拐弯抹角兜圈子了
<4-20,Meemaw>Okay, now let's you and me get something straight.

151
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,400
<4-20,Meemaw>他或许以为我是来给他做饼干的
<4-20,Meemaw>He may think that I came to bake him cookies,

152
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,540
<4-20,Meemaw>但我来的真正原因是要掂掂你的斤两
<4-20,Meemaw>but the real reason is to size you up.

153
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,400
<4-21,Amy>掂掂...我的斤两
<4-21,Amy>Si-Size me up?

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,660

<4-22,Meemaw>Sheldon's mother may be okay with you,

155
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,150
<4-22,Meemaw>但我可没这么好说话
<4-22,Meemaw>but I'm not so easy.

<4-22,Meemaw>我...
<4-22,Meemaw>Well, I-I'm...

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,980
<4-24,Meemaw>你最好希望如此

<4-27,Sheldon>你得到看我玩这个的机会呢

00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,340
<5-13,Raj>说了"科学家"后就应该打住的人
<5-13,Raj>guy who probably should have stopped at "scientist."

<5-18,Howard>他的《星际宝贝》收集瓷盘可以证明这一点
<5-18,Howard>and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.

00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,340
<5-27,Raj>我没觉得她算美女吧
<5-27,Raj>I wouldn't say she's beautiful.

207
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,390
<5-28,Howard>真的吗  你不觉得她迷人吗
<5-28,Howard>Really? You don't think she's attractive?

208
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,310
<5-29,Raj>觉得啊  我只是不会跟女朋友说而已
<5-29,Raj>I do. I just wouldn't tell my girlfriend.

209
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,530
<6-1,Penny>康斯坦丝  您确定不用我给您倒点红酒吗
<6-1,Penny>Constance, are you sure I can't pour you some wine?

210
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,570
<6-2,Meemaw>不用给我倒红酒了

215
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,700
<6-4,Meemaw>谢谢  小甜饼
<6-4,Meemaw>Thank you, Moon Pie.

216
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,980
<6-5,Amy>我很好奇
<6-5,Amy>Um, curious.

217
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,150
<6-5,Amy>您为什么叫谢尔顿"小甜饼"
<6-5,Amy>Why do you call Sheldon "Moon Pie?"

218
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,940
<6-6,Meemaw>因为他美味可人
<6-6,Meemaw>'Cause he's so nummy-nummy.

219
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,630
<6-7,Leonard and Penny>她想把他一口吃掉
<6-7,Leonard and Penny>She could just eat him up.

220
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,090
<6-8,Sheldon>我叫她"姥姥"
<6-8,Sheldon>And I call her "Meemaw,"

221
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,430
<6-8,Sheldon>是因为  你们看她就知道了
<6-8,Sheldon>because, well, just, well, look at her.

222
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,410
<6-9,Meemaw>真有意思
<6-9,Meemaw>It's interesting that

223
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,460
<6-9,Meemaw>莱纳德和佩妮都知道他昵称的由来
<6-9,Meemaw>Leonard and Penny know about his nickname

224
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,110
<6-9,Meemaw>而你却不知道
<6-9,Meemaw>and you don't.

225
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,690
<6-10,Amy>话说回来
<6-10,Amy>Oh, well, you know,

226
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,890
<6-10,Amy>现在听你们这么一说  我好像有点印象了
<6-10,Amy>now-now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar.

227
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,910
<6-11,Sheldon>怎么可能
<6-11,Sheldon>How could it?

228
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,730
<6-11,Sheldon>我从来没跟你说过  你也从来没问过
<6-11,Sheldon>I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.

229
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,390
<6-12,Amy>我现在知道了
<6-12,Amy>Well, now I know.

230
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,890
<6-14,Meemaw>佩妮  我得知你有一份新工作
<6-14,Meemaw>So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.

231
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,450
<6-14,Meemaw>是的
<6-14,Meemaw>Yes.

232
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,530
<6-15,Penny>我现在是一名医药销售
<6-15,Penny>I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.

<6-16,Meemaw>你们现代女性要啥有啥  真棒
<6-16,Meemaw>It's so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all.

234
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,080
<6-16,Meemaw>有丈夫  还能有一份全职工作
<6-16,Meemaw>A husband and a full-time career.

235
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,210
<6-17,Amy>我也有一个男朋友和一份全职工作啊
<6-17,Amy>I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.

236
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,790
<6-18,Meemaw>那不是什么好事
<6-18,Meemaw>That doesn't bode well.

237
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,180
<6-19,Amy>为什么  她有工作你就说好
<6-19,Amy>Why not? You-you just said it's okay for her to work.

238
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,550
<6-20,Meemaw>莱纳德不像谢尔顿那么需要人照顾
<6-20,Meemaw>Well, Leonard doesn't need as much tending to as Sheldon does.

239
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,400
<6-20,Meemaw>而且小甜饼跟我解释过
<6-20,Meemaw>And as Moon Pie explained,

240
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,900
<6-20,Meemaw>莱纳德的工作更像是爱好
<6-20,Meemaw>Leonard's work is more of a hobby.

241
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,770
<6-21,Leonard>-真是我"最好的朋友"  -是啊
<6-21,Leonard>- That's my best friend. - Yeah.

242
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,410
<6-23,Amy>我知道您很呵护你的外孙
<6-23,Amy>Look, I-I get that you're protective of your grandson,

243
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,410
<6-23,Amy>但他已经是个成年人了
<6-23,Amy>but he's an adult now.

244
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,030
<6-23,Amy>也许我比您更懂得他的所需所求
<6-23,Amy>Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.

245

290
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,520
<6-48,Sheldon>但你们如此暴躁  是否有可能是因为

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,670
<6-48,Sheldon>你俩月经周期刚好同步了呢
<6-48,Sheldon>your cycles have synced?

293
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,600
<6-49,Meemaw>让我们大人说话
<6-49,Meemaw>and let the grown-ups talk.

294
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,730
<6-49,Meemaw>赶紧的
<6-49,Meemaw>Now.

295
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,360
<6-50,Amy>别像说小孩那样说他
<6-50,Amy>Don't speak to him like he's a child.

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,850
<6-50,Amy>谢谢你帮我撑腰
<6-50,Amy>Thank you.

297

<6-51,Sheldon>我要去隔壁和莱纳德一起玩了
<6-51,Sheldon>I'm gonna go next door and play with Leonard.

298
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,590
<7-1,Bernadette>所以你遇到一个姑娘  交换了电话号码
<7-1,Bernadette>Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers,

299
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,850
<7-1,Bernadette>然后还要和她再见面
<7-1,Bernadette>and you're gonna meet up with her.

300
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,630
<7-2,Raj>只是为了帮她完成剧本而已
<7-2,Raj>Just to help her with her screenplay.

301
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,560
<7-3,Bernadette>这样应该没什么问题
<7-3,Bernadette>Oh. Well, I guess that's not so bad.

302
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,490
<7-4,Howard>你当时不在现场
<7-4,Howard>You weren't there.

303
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,920
<7-4,Howard>他一直在撩人家
<7-4,Howard>He was really flirting.

304
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,560
<7-5,Raj>如果美国妞们钟爱我这样
<7-5,Raj>Hey, it's not my fault if American women project

305
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,280
<7-5,Raj>声音扣人心弦
<7-5,Raj>their fantasies on foreigners

306
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,620
<7-5,Raj>又帮人实现愿望异国精灵  那也不是我的错啊
<7-5,Raj>with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.

307
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,390
<7-6,Bernadette>我想这无伤大雅
<7-6,Bernadette>I'm sure it was harmless.

308
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,110
<7-6,Bernadette>人人都会互撩  不是大问题
<7-6,Bernadette>People flirt. No big deal.

309
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,430
<7-7,Howard>真的吗  那如果我也...

<7-8,Bernadette>Not you. I own your ass.

311
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,770
<7-8,Bernadette>关键是  你和艾米丽进展到什么程度了
<7-8,Bernadette>The real question is, where are you with Emily?

312
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,600
<7-9,Raj>这点很难说
<7-9,Raj>Uh, it's hard to say.

313
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,700
<7-9,Raj>我们进展不错  但今天发生的事
<7-9,Raj>I think we're good, but things like this

314
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,310
<7-9,Raj>让我开始考虑艾米丽是否是我的真命天女
<7-9,Raj>make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me.

315
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,320
<7-9,Raj>你们俩曾经怀疑过对方是你的真爱吗
<7-9,Raj>I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?

<7-13,Bernadette>Howie, you forget how much of our early dates

319
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,210
<7-13,Bernadette>你总是在变魔术  我总是在强颜欢笑吗
<7-13,Bernadette>involved you doing magic and me doing this.

320
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,340
<7-13,Bernadette>好吧
<7-13,Bernadette>Fine.

321
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,390
<7-14,Howard>那我对你也曾有过怀疑
<7-14,Howard>I had reservations about you, too.

<7-15,Bernadette>-你没有  -好吧  我没有
<7-15,Bernadette>- No, you didn't. - No, I didn't.

<7-17,Bernadette>总之都不重要了
<7-17,Bernadette>Well, it doesn't matter now,

324
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,020
<7-17,Bernadette>我喜欢我俩现在的状态

326
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,600
<7-18,Howard>你在我眼中比这朵玫瑰花更美丽
<7-18,Howard>And I think you're even more beautiful than this rose.

327
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,840
<8-1,Penny>我上次见到我姥姥时
<8-1,Penny>The last time I saw my grandma,

328
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,300
<8-1,Penny>最开心的事就是
<8-1,Penny>the most exciting thing was watching

329
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,130
<8-1,Penny>看着她的烟灰慢慢变长
<8-1,Penny>the ash of her cigarette get longer

330
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,880
<8-1,Penny>然后猜会不会直接掉到她的布丁上
<8-1,Penny>and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.

331
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,590
<8-2,Leonard>结果呢
<8-2,Leonard>Did it?

332
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,500
<8-3,Penny>当然掉了  然后她还没发现全吃下去了
<8-3,Penny>Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.

333
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,390
<8-4,Sheldon>莱纳德和佩妮

338
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,370
<8-7,Sheldon>没有  她们让我离开
<8-7,Sheldon>No. They asked me to leave

339
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,030
<8-7,Sheldon>以便她们单独聊聊
<8-7,Sheldon>so they could speak privately.

340
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,310
<8-9,Sheldon>是的  形势真是剑拔弩张
<8-9,Sheldon>Yeah, I know. It was quite tense.

341
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,480
<8-9,Sheldon>所以现在的问题是
<8-9,Sheldon>So here's the million dollar question:

342
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,820
<8-9,Sheldon>你们谁想过去把我的火车拿过来
<8-9,Sheldon>uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?

<9-3,Bernadette>"我决定了  我要扮成双胞胎兄弟
<9-3,Bernadette>"Made up my mind to date both of them

349
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,660

<9-11,Claire>好的  恭喜你
<9-11,Claire>Okay. Good for you.

365
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,640
<9-11,Claire>不  不是

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,140
<9-12,Raj>我是不希望让你误会
<9-12,Raj>I-I didn't want to mislead you

367
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,620
<9-12,Raj>毕竟你约我出去
<9-12,Raj>after you asked me out.

368
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,080
<9-13,Claire>我不是约你啊
<9-13,Claire>I didn't ask you out.

369
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,380
<9-13,Claire>我只是找你帮忙我写剧本
<9-13,Claire>I just need help with my screenplay.

370
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,570
<9-14,Raj>等等  你是说我们之间不来电吗
<9-14,Raj>Wait, are you saying that we didn't have a vibe?

371
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,820
<9-15,Claire>你为什么在乎来不来电
<9-15,Claire>Why do you care if we have a vibe?

372
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,010
<9-15,Claire>你都有女朋友了
<9-15,Claire>You have a girlfriend.

373
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,280
<9-16,Raj>不是吧  我都告诉你我有女朋友了
<9-16,Raj>Come on! I just told you I had a girlfriend.

374
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,830
<9-16,Raj>起码你也得客套说我们之间来电吧
<9-16,Raj>The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.

375
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,500
<9-17,Claire>可以  我们来电
<9-17,Claire>Sure, we had a vibe.

376
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,880
<9-18,Raj>我就知道  我们之间来电哦
<9-18,Raj>I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe.

377
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,550
<9-18,Raj>太兴奋了
<9-18,Raj>This is exciting.

378
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,890
<9-18,Raj>我下一步干嘛
<9-18,Raj>What's my next move?

379
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,560
<9-19,Bernadette>你还有女朋友呢
<9-19,Bernadette>You still have a girlfriend.

380
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,440
<9-20,Raj>对了  说得好
<9-20,Raj>Right. Good catch.

381
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,120
<9-20,Raj>总之很抱歉浪费了你的时间
<9-20,Raj>Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time.

382
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,320
<9-20,Raj>还有祝你剧本写作顺利
<9-20,Raj>And, uh... and good luck with your screenplay.

383
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,340
<9-21,Claire>等一下
<9-21,Claire>Hang on.

384
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,190
<9-21,Claire>我们都是成人了
<9-21,Claire>We're both adults.

385
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,590
<9-21,Claire>出来聚聚不一定非得意味着什么呀
<9-21,Claire>We can still get together without it meaning anything.

386
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,840
<9-22,Raj>我不行  自从你承认我们之间来电后
<9-22,Raj>Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe,

387
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,860
<9-22,Raj>我已经开始策划我们的婚礼了
<9-22,Raj>I've been planning our wedding.

388
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,000
<9-23,Claire>听着  只是喝杯咖啡
<9-23,Claire>Look, it's just coffee.

389

<9-23,Claire>I'll ask you some questions about science,

390
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,720
<9-23,Claire>我发誓  如果你求婚  我一定拒绝
<9-23,Claire>and if you propose, I promise to say no.

391
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,620
<9-24,Raj>行吧  虽然有点伤人  但行吧
<9-24,Raj>Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,220
<9-28,Raj>当然了
<9-28,Raj>Yeah, of course.

399
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,400
<9-28,Raj>我们之间没有秘密

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,060
<9-29,Howard>你准备什么时候告诉艾米丽
<9-29,Howard>When are you gonna tell Emily?

401
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,680
<9-30,Raj>奶油奶酪的事他撒谎了
<9-30,Raj>He lied about the cream cheese!

402
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,880
<9-30,Raj>整块都被他吃了  我看到了
<9-30,Raj>He ate the whole thing! I saw him!

403
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,010
<10-1,Amy>听着  我知道你认为我不适合谢尔顿
<10-1,Amy>Look, I know you think I'm not right for Sheldon,

404
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,930
<10-1,Amy>但相信我  他找不到更好的了
<10-1,Amy>but trust me, I'm his best shot.

405
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,010
<10-1,Amy>你根本不知道我忍受了些什么
<10-1,Amy>You have no idea how much I put up with!

406
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,410
<10-2,Meemaw>我比你更清楚
<10-2,Meemaw>I know more than you think I do.

407
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,000
<10-3,Amy>是吗  你知道就因为谷歌换字体
<10-3,Amy>Really? You know what it's like to have date night ruined

408
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,620
<10-3,Amy>约会之夜就被毁了的滋味吗
<10-3,Amy>because Google changed their font?

409
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,530
<10-4,Meemaw>小姑娘
<10-4,Meemaw>Young lady,

410
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,780
<10-4,Meemaw>如果你认为我不了解
<10-4,Meemaw>if you think I don't know what it's like

411
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,690
<10-4,Meemaw>跟一个顽固自大的人一起生活是什么感觉
<10-4,Meemaw>to live with a stubborn, egotistical man,

412
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,840
<10-4,Meemaw>那你就错了
<10-4,Meemaw>then you're wrong.

413
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,360
<10-4,Meemaw>因为我老公就是那德行
<10-4,Meemaw>'Cause that was my husband.

414
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,890
<10-5,Amy>是吗
<10-5,Amy>Really?

415
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,860
<10-6,Meemaw>有时候我真想给他的口袋里塞满玉米
<10-6,Meemaw>There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn

416
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,300
<10-6,Meemaw>然后扔他进猪圈  杀他个尸骨无存
<10-6,Meemaw>and toss him in the pigpen.

417
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,350
<10-7,Amy>既然你都了解
<10-7,Amy>Well, if you understand,

418
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,010
<10-7,Amy>为什么还要为难我呢
<10-7,Amy>then why are you giving me such a hard time?

419
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,070
<10-8,Meemaw>因为当初你和谢尔顿分手
<10-8,Meemaw>Because when you broke up with Sheldon,

420
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,260
<10-8,Meemaw>深深地伤害了他
<10-8,Meemaw>it hurt him deeply,

421
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,550
<10-8,Meemaw>我不希望再发生一次这种事
<10-8,Meemaw>and I don't want to see that happen again.

422
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,880
<10-9,Penny>抱歉
<10-9,Penny>Hi. Sorry.

423
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,270
<10-9,Penny>谢尔顿有些话想对你们说
<10-9,Penny>Sheldon would like to say something to you.

424
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,150
<10-10,Sheldon>没有  我没有
<10-10,Sheldon>No, I wouldn't.

425
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,780
<10-11,Leonard>赶紧进来
<10-11,Leonard>Just get in here.

426
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,770
<10-12,Sheldon>你们好
<10-12,Sheldon>Hello.

427
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,650
<10-13,Penny>去吧
<10-13,Penny>Go ahead.

428
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,350
<10-14,Sheldon>姥姥  听着
<10-14,Sheldon>Meemaw, look,

429
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,380
<10-14,Sheldon>我很抱歉  但是...
<10-14,Sheldon>I'm sorry, but...

430
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,370
<10-14,Sheldon>我必须替我女朋友说几句
<10-14,Sheldon>I have to defend my girlfriend to you.

431
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,800
<10-15,Amy>谢尔顿  谢谢你
<10-15,Amy>Oh, Sheldon, thank you.

432
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,460
<10-16,Sheldon>这下好  你要一把鼻涕一把泪了
<10-16,Sheldon>Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional.

433
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,040
<10-16,Sheldon>我一直都很尊敬你和姥爷
<10-16,Sheldon>I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop.

434
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,570
<10-16,Sheldon>我知道他这个人有多难搞
<10-16,Sheldon>I-I know what a challenging man he could be,

435
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,180
<10-16,Sheldon>但我看到的是  你在他身边
<10-16,Sheldon>but I saw you stand by him

436
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,590
<10-16,Sheldon>让他变成更好的人
<10-16,Sheldon>and-and make him into a better person.

437
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,460
<10-17,Meemaw>确实是
<10-17,Meemaw>I did.

438
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,850
<10-18,Sheldon>正是如此  所以过去五年中
<10-18,Sheldon>Yeah, well, that is exactly

439
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,840
<10-18,Sheldon>我也是这样做的
<10-18,Sheldon>what I've been doing the last five years

440
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,750
<10-18,Sheldon>帮这个小麻烦一点点进步
<10-18,Sheldon>with this little work in progress.

441
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,420
<10-19,Leonard>永远让人目瞪口呆  对吧
<10-19,Leonard>He never disappoints, does he?

442
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,500
<10-20,Amy>我觉得谢尔顿想说的是
<10-20,Amy>I think what Sheldon means to say is

443
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,660
<10-20,Amy>我们一起成长
<10-20,Amy>we've both grown together.

444
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,960
<10-20,Amy>对不对
<10-20,Amy>Isn't that right?

445
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,370
<10-22,Penny>-说对  -对
<10-22,Penny>- Say yes. - Yes.

446
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,950
<10-23,Sheldon>好吧
<10-23,Sheldon>Fine.

447
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,900
<10-24,Meemaw>既然你如此坚持  我不会阻拦你
<10-24,Meemaw>If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.

448
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,090
<10-25,Sheldon>谢谢
<10-25,Sheldon>Thank you.

449
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,410
<10-26,Amy>所以如果他想把那枚订婚戒指给我
<10-26,Amy>So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring,

450
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,380
<10-26,Amy>你会祝福我们吗
<10-26,Amy>we would have your blessing?

451
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,320
<10-27,Meemaw>大概吧
<10-27,Meemaw>I suppose.

452
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,120
<10-28,Sheldon>我才把童子之身给了你  女人
<10-28,Sheldon>I just gave you my virginity, woman.

453
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,100
<10-28,Sheldon>别那么猴急
<10-28,Sheldon>Cool your jets.

454
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,090
<11-1,Raj>对  你看  如果你把故事改成
<11-1,Raj>Yeah, see, if you just change the story

455
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,540
<11-1,Raj>我们星系的毁灭
<11-1,Raj>to the destruction of our galaxy,

456
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,030
<11-1,Raj>那么超级大质量黑洞就可以说得通
<11-1,Raj>then a super massive black hole could work.

457
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,790
<11-2,Claire>太棒了
<11-2,Claire>This is great.

458
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,550
<11-2,Claire>非常感谢
<11-2,Claire>Thank you so much.

459
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,660
<11-2,Claire>我得想出一种
<11-2,Claire>I just got to figure out a way for everyone

460
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,380
<11-2,Claire>既不吓到孩子  又能把人都写死的方法
<11-2,Claire>to die that isn't too scary for children.

461
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,210
<11-3,Raj>那就是老爸老妈的浪漫史
<11-3,Raj>And that's how Mommy and Daddy met.

462
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,420
<11-4,Claire>你有没有跟艾米丽说我们的事
<11-4,Claire>Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?

463
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,480
<11-5,Raj>我会说的
<11-5,Raj>I will!
