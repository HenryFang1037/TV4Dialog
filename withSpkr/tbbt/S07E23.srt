00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,110
<1-4,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我不需要用跑步机
<1-4,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I don't need a treadmill!

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,860
<1-5,Howard>医生说你需要运动
<1-5,Howard>The doctor says you need to get exercise!

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,210
<1-6,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我平常已经运动够多了
<1-6,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I get plenty of exercise!

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,640
<1-7,Howard>摧毁我的生存意志不算运动
<1-7,Howard>Crushing my will to live isn't exercise!

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,000
<1-8,Raj>如果她不打算用  我们辛苦搬这个干嘛
<1-8,Raj>If she isn't gonna use it, then why are we doing this?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,960
<1-8,Raj>她会用的
<1-8,Raj>She'll use it.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,140
<1-9,Howard>我只需在机器前装根鱼干
<1-9,Howard>All I need is to rig it

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,090
<1-9,Howard>绑上蜜汁火腿就行
<1-9,Howard>with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,540
<1-9,Howard>好了
<1-9,Howard>All right.

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,020
<1-10,Raj>下一步干嘛
<1-10,Raj>Now what?

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,790
<1-11,Bernadette>把它搬进华仔旧房间里组装
<1-11,Bernadette>We set it up in Howie's old room.

16
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,130
<1-12,Raj>你知道怎么组装吗
<1-12,Raj>Do you know how to set it up?

17
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,530
<1-13,Howard>拜托  我可是麻省理工的工程师
<1-13,Howard>Please, I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

18
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,760
<1-13,Howard>区区一台跑步机...

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,060
<1-13,Howard>妈  小心
<1-13,Howard>Ma, look out!

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,560
<1-14,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我就说这玩意会搞死我
<1-14,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I told you this thing would kill me!

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,270
<2-1,Raj>她得卧床足足六周以上
<2-1,Raj>So she's gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.

33
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,890
<2-2,Leonard>沃洛维茨太太真可怜
<2-2,Leonard>Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.

34
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,650
<2-3,Amy>我们该为她做点什么吗
<2-3,Amy>Should we do something for her?

35
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,870
<2-3,Amy>我知道做啥
<2-3,Amy>I know.

36

<2-5,Amy>谢尔顿  那可是你好友的母亲
<2-5,Amy>Sheldon, we're talking about your friend's mother.

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,070
<2-5,Amy>她受伤了
<2-5,Amy>She got hurt.

39
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,060
<2-6,Sheldon>我还以为那个话题聊够了
<2-6,Sheldon>I thought that subject had run its course,

40
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,820
<2-6,Sheldon>所以我换个话题
<2-6,Sheldon>so I changed it.

41
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,200
<2-6,Sheldon>这叫眼力见儿  艾米
<2-6,Sheldon>It's called reading the room, Amy.

42
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,510

<2-9,Penny>挺顺利的其实
<2-9,Penny>Uh, pretty good, actually.

45
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,060
<2-10,Raj>所以那电影其实没你想象中那么烂吗
<2-10,Raj>So the movie's not as bad as you thought?

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,200
<2-11,Penny>真就那么烂
<2-11,Penny>Oh, no, it is,

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,080
<2-11,Penny>但我决定  与其每天抱怨个不停
<2-11,Penny>but I decided, instead of complaining about it,

48
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,310
<2-11,Penny>不如卯足全力去做好它
<2-11,Penny>I'm just gonna go in every day and give it my all.

49
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,630
<2-12,Amy>-佩服佩服  -客气客气
<2-12,Amy>- Good for you. - Thanks.

50
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,070
<2-13,Penny>在慢慢转化成杀人恶猿的
<2-13,Penny>There's no reason why I shouldn't be

51

<2-13,Penny>史上最炫酷的双性恋热场舞者界中
<2-13,Penny>the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming

52
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,290
<2-13,Penny>我没理由当不了业界之王啊
<2-13,Penny>into a killer gorilla anyone's ever seen.

53
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,040
<2-13,Penny>那可不好说
<2-13,Penny>I don't know.

54
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,460
<2-14,Leonard>《辛德勒名单》里的双性恋热场舞者杀人猿
<2-14,Leonard>The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler's List

55
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,330
<2-14,Leonard>很难演赢他啊
<2-14,Leonard>is tough to beat.

56
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,930
<2-15,Sheldon>这笑话好笑
<2-15,Sheldon>Ah, very good.

57
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,040
<2-15,Sheldon>因为任何性取向的热场舞者杀人恶猿
<2-15,Sheldon>Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,160
<2-15,Sheldon>在跟纳粹大屠杀有关的电影中都会很突兀
<2-15,Sheldon>would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.

59
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,870
<2-16,Leonard>谢尔顿  你解释出来  笑点"加倍"啊
<2-16,Leonard>It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.

60
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,860
<2-17,Sheldon>我知道
<2-17,Sheldon>I know.

61
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,200
<3-1,Howard>我把她在客房里安顿好了
<3-1,Howard>Okay, she's all settled in the guest room.

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,600
<3-2,Bernadette>我们是不是该买一台那种
<3-2,Bernadette>Maybe we should get one of those machines

63
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,380
<3-2,Bernadette>能帮忙她上楼梯的机械
<3-2,Bernadette>to help her up the stairs.

64
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,420
<3-3,Howard>你是指叉车吗
<3-3,Howard>You mean a forklift?

65
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,980
<3-4,Bernadette>-华仔  -对不起
<3-4,Bernadette>- Howie... - I'm sorry.

66
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,960
<3-5,Howard>小华子真心做不到啊
<3-5,Howard>I just can't deal with this right now.

67
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,330
<3-6,Bernadette>照顾你亲妈吗  你怎么能说这种话
<3-6,Bernadette>Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?

68
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,040
<3-7,Howard>妮妮  她接下来六到八周会不便于行
<3-7,Howard>Bernie, she's gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks.

69
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,640
<3-7,Howard>你准备好喂食她  帮她洗澡
<3-7,Howard>Are you prepared to feed her, wash her

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,300
<3-7,Howard>带她上厕所了吗
<3-7,Howard>and take her to the toilet?

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,530
<3-8,Bernadette>-我愿意这么照顾我妈啊  -你当然会啦
<3-8,Bernadette>- I would do it for my mother. - Yeah, of course you would--

72
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,410
<3-9,Howard>你是有爱心的人
<3-9,Howard>you're a loving person.

73
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,850
<3-9,Howard>我就是犹太人称为"贱精"的那种人
<3-9,Howard>I'm what my people would call a putz.

74
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,490
<3-10,Bernadette>我也并不是很期待做那些事
<3-10,Bernadette>Look, I'm not crazy about the idea,

75
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,140
<3-10,Bernadette>只是我们还有别的选择吗
<3-10,Bernadette>but what other choice do we have?

76
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,320
<3-11,Howard>我们可以请个看护啊
<3-11,Howard>We get a nurse.

77
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,280
<3-11,Howard>最好是个来自第三世界国家的看护
<3-11,Howard>Preferably someone from a Third World country

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,700
<3-11,Howard>因为他们习惯了受折磨与闻臭味
<3-11,Howard>who's used to suffering and unpleasant smells.

79
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,310
<3-12,Bernadette>你会请个陌生人
<3-12,Bernadette>You'd hire a total stranger

80
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,950
<3-12,Bernadette>来照顾抚养你长大的那个女人吗
<3-12,Bernadette>to take care of the woman who raised you?

81
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,130
<3-12,Bernadette>太没人性了吧
<3-12,Bernadette>That's so cruel.

82
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,290
<3-13,Howard>如果我们多付点钱
<3-13,Howard>Not if we pay them well

83
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,480
<3-13,Howard>再让他们听家乡的音乐就不会太没人性啦
<3-13,Howard>and let them listen to the music of their homeland.

84
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,580
<3-14,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我想要嘘嘘
<3-14,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I need to tinkle!

85
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,160
<3-15,Howard>这活儿最合适有爱心的人干啦
<3-15,Howard>Sounds like a job for a loving person.

86
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,290
<3-15,Howard>在你扛她去厕所的时候
<3-15,Howard>Would you like me to play some Polish music

87
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,710
<3-15,Howard>需要放点波兰音乐吗
<3-15,Howard>while you carry her to the toilet?

89
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,000
<3-16,Bernadette>你果然是个贱精
<3-16,Bernadette>You are a putz.

90
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,180
<3-17,Howard>假一赔十哦
<3-17,Howard>As advertised.

91
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,350
<4-1,Sheldon>谢谢你陪我来
<4-1,Sheldon>Thanks for coming with me.

92
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,260
<4-2,Raj>谢谢你在所有人拒绝你后  邀请我来
<4-2,Raj>Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no.

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,980
<4-2,Raj>你不拿付3D眼镜吗
<4-2,Raj>Aren't you gonna get 3-D glasses?

94
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,500
<4-3,Sheldon>我自己带了
<4-3,Sheldon>I brought my own.

95
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,410
<4-3,Sheldon>我可不想染上鼻梁疱疹
<4-3,Sheldon>No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.

96
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,410
<4-4,Raj>真有这个病吗
<4-4,Raj>Is that a real thing?

97
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,320
<4-5,Sheldon>在有人发明鼻部保险套之前
<4-5,Sheldon>Well, until they invent nose condoms,

98
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,120
<4-5,Sheldon>我不想以"鼻"犯险
<4-5,Sheldon>I'm not finding out.

99
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,870
<4-6,Raj>艾米丽
<4-6,Raj>Emily! Hey!

100
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,560
<4-7,Emily>拉杰
<4-7,Emily>Oh, hey, Raj.

101
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,740
<4-8,Raj>这位是我朋友  谢尔顿
<4-8,Raj>Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon.

102
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,780
<4-8,Raj>谢尔顿  她就是艾米丽
<4-8,Raj>Sheldon, this is Emily.

103
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,720
<4-9,Sheldon>知道了  你就是那位皮肤科医师
<4-9,Sheldon>Oh, yes, you're the dermatologist.

104
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,800
<4-9,Sheldon>我昨天去散步没有擦防晒霜
<4-9,Sheldon>I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen.

105
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,280
<4-9,Sheldon>我的额头部位有任何
<4-9,Sheldon>Do you see anything on my forehead

106
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,820
<4-9,Sheldon>我该担心的病灶吗
<4-9,Sheldon>that I should be concerned about?

107
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,080
<4-10,Emily>其实我有点赶时间
<4-10,Emily>Um, you know what? I better go.

108
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,590
<4-10,Emily>我的电影要开始了
<4-10,Emily>My movie's about to start.

109
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,680
<4-11,Raj>你是自己来的吗
<4-11,Raj>Are you here alone?

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,870
<4-12,Emily>不算吧
<4-12,Emily>No, not really.

111
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,900
<4-13,Raj>什么叫"不算吧"
<4-13,Raj>What do you mean, "not really"?

112
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,390
<4-14,Man>-我们进去吧  -好
<4-14,Man>- Hey, should we get our seats? - Yeah.

113
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,280
<4-15,Emily>很高兴遇到你  我晚点打给你
<4-15,Emily>It was nice seeing you. Um, I'll call you later.

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,800
<4-16,Raj>好吧
<4-16,Raj>Yeah, okay.

115
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,240
<4-17,Sheldon>刚才真尴尬  是吧
<4-17,Sheldon>That was awkward, right?

116
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,380
<4-18,Raj>尴尬是因为撞见你的妞
<4-18,Raj>Is it because she's dating you

117
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,240
<4-19,Sheldon>跟别的男人约会吗
<4-19,Sheldon>but was out with that other fellow?

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,920
<4-20,Raj>是的
<4-20,Raj>Yes.

119
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,940
<4-21,Sheldon>那就好  我还以为是因为看见我的病灶了呢
<4-21,Sheldon>Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.

120
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,950
<5-1,Director>开拍
<5-1,Director>And... action.

121
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,890
<5-2,Wil Wheaton>不要将我拒之门外
<5-2,Wil Wheaton>Please don't shut me out.

122
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,390
<5-3,Penny>走开
<5-3,Penny>Go away.

123
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,760
<5-3,Penny>快走开
<5-3,Penny>Just go away.

124
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,110
<5-4,Wil>我发誓  我一定会想办法把你变回来的
<5-4,Wil>I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.

125
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,360
<5-5,Penny>你凭什么
<5-5,Penny>What gave you the right

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,900
<5-5,Penny>把我的DNA混进了杀人恶猿的DNA
<5-5,Penny>to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?

127
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,080
<5-6,Wil>我当时一心只想让你活下去
<5-6,Wil>I was trying to save your life.

128
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,170
<5-7,Penny>活着有何用  你看我  现在就是个怪兽
<5-7,Penny>Life? What life? Look at me! I'm a monster!

129
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,870
<5-7,Penny>我的双手沾满鲜血
<5-7,Penny>And now I have blood on my hands, or

130
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,090
<5-7,Penny>或我的双爪  随便啦
<5-7,Penny>paws. I don't know.

131
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,060
<5-8,Wil>你不能放弃  我爱你
<5-8,Wil>You can't give up. I love you.

132
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,080
<5-9,Penny>我也爱你
<5-9,Penny>I love you, too.

133
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,450
<5-9,Penny>但恐怕我更爱杀戮
<5-9,Penny>But I'm afraid I love killing more.

134
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,310
<5-9,Penny>或许有一天我会试图...杀了你
<5-9,Penny>Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you!

135
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,220
<5-10,Director>停  很好
<5-10,Director>And... cut. All right.

136
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,760
<5-10,Director>可以准备下一场戏了
<5-10,Director>All right, let's set up for the next scene.

137
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,240
<5-11,Penny>导演  能再拍一次吗
<5-11,Penny>Actually, you know what? Can we do one more?

138
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,670
<5-11,Penny>刚才没发挥好
<5-11,Penny>I think I could do it better.

139
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,680
<5-12,Director>就这样吧
<5-12,Director>Let's just move on.

140
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,160
<5-12,Director>-没人会介意  -但我会
<5-12,Director>- No one cares. - Well, I care.

141
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,800
<5-13,Penny>我觉得既然要拍
<5-13,Penny>I mean, look, if we're gonna do this,

142
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,860
<5-13,Penny>何不好好拍一部让我们引以为傲的电影
<5-13,Penny>why not try and make it something we're actually proud of?

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,920
<5-14,Director>小宝贝
<5-14,Director>Look, sweetie,

144
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,160
<5-14,Director>这是部垃圾电影
<5-14,Director>this movie is garbage,

145
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,690
<5-14,Director>但你应该开心
<5-14,Director>but you should be happy about that,

146
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,380
<5-14,Director>因为如果这是部好电影  那根本轮不到你来演
<5-14,Director>'cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn't be in it.

147
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,670
<5-15,Leonard>打住打住
<5-15,Leonard>Whoa, whoa, hang on.

148
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,260
<5-15,Leonard>你没必要羞辱她吧
<5-15,Leonard>There's no need to insult her.

149
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,070
<5-16,Director>你是哪位啊
<5-16,Director>And who are you?

150
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,260
<5-17,Leonard>我是她的男朋友
<5-17,Leonard>I'm her boyfriend.

151
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,650
<5-18,Director>不觉得高攀了吗
<5-18,Director>Isn't she too hot for you?

152
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,100
<5-19,Leonard>有点吧
<5-19,Leonard>A little, yeah.

153
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,740
<5-20,Director>好了  男朋友  滚出我的片场
<5-20,Director>Well, boyfriend, get off my set.

154
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,880
<5-21,Penny>不许  他是来陪我的
<5-21,Penny>You can't do that. He's with me.

155
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,660
<5-22,Director>是吗  那你也可以滚出我的片场了
<5-22,Director>You know what? You can get off my set, too.

156
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,300
<5-22,Director>你被解雇了
<5-22,Director>You're fired.

157
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,350
<5-23,Penny>什么  你不能解雇我  我可是主演啊
<5-23,Penny>What? You can't fire me. I'm the star.

158
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,920
<5-23,Penny>我可是"疯妹子"  电影宣传海报上写着呢
<5-23,Penny>I'm the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.

159
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,060
<5-24,Director>但刚才已经拍完了你露脸的最后一场戏
<5-24,Director>Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face.

160
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,870
<5-24,Director>所以从现在开始  谁戴这个谁就是主演
<5-24,Director>So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.

161
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,400
<5-25,Wil>如果你要解雇她
<5-25,Wil>Hey, if you're gonna fire her,

162
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,310
<5-25,Wil>那我也不干了
<5-25,Wil>then you have to fire me, too.

163
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,660
<6-1,Wil>靠  说炒人就炒人啊
<6-1,Wil>Wow, that fell apart really fast.

164
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,780
<6-1,Wil>谢谢你不看电影陪我回来
<6-1,Wil>Thanks for skipping the movie.

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,660
<6-1,Wil>我实在没办法静下心看两个小时的电影
<6-1,Wil>I couldn't sit in that theater for two hours

166
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,010
<7-1,Raj>而不去想艾米丽和那个男人
<7-1,Raj>wondering about Emily and that guy.

167
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,660
<7-2,Sheldon>真的没关系
<7-2,Sheldon>Oh, quite all right.

168
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,710
<7-2,Sheldon>我得了额头黑素瘤恐慌症后
<7-2,Sheldon>After my forehead melanoma scare,

169
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,130
<7-2,Sheldon>已经学会了不再为小事斤斤计较
<7-2,Sheldon>I've learned not to sweat the small stuff.

170
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,370
<7-2,Sheldon>不好意思
<7-2,Sheldon>Well, sorry,

171
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,340
<7-2,Sheldon>我这里没有做印度拉茶的所有原料
<7-2,Sheldon>I don't have all the ingredients to make chai tea.

172
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,550
<7-3,Raj>你不必为我做什么
<7-3,Raj>You don't have to make me anything.

173
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,960
<7-4,Sheldon>不行  你在为艾米丽烦恼
<7-4,Sheldon>No, I do. You're upset about Emily

174
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,760
<7-4,Sheldon>而且你是印度人
<7-4,Sheldon>and you're Indian.

175
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,880
<7-4,Sheldon>我一定要给你做拉茶
<7-4,Sheldon>I need to make you chai tea.

176
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,900
<7-4,Sheldon>我这里其他原料都有  就差豆蔻籽
<7-4,Sheldon>Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds.

177
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,210
<7-4,Sheldon>你会不会碰巧有随身携带吧
<7-4,Sheldon>Do you happen to have any on you?

178
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,260
<7-5,Raj>抱歉  我落在我的印度头巾里了
<7-5,Raj>Sorry, I left them in my turban.

179
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,810
<7-6,Sheldon>那我只好给你泡英国早餐茶了
<7-6,Sheldon>Oh, I'll make English breakfast tea.

180
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,030
<7-6,Sheldon>反正他们摧毁了你们的文化
<7-6,Sheldon>They destroyed your culture.

182
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,850
<7-6,Sheldon>也算跟印度有点关系吧
<7-6,Sheldon>That's close enough.

183
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,380
<7-6,Sheldon>其实我很好奇
<7-6,Sheldon>You know, I'm curious,

184
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,860
<7-6,Sheldon>你干嘛对艾米丽跟其他男人出去这么不爽
<7-6,Sheldon>why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?

185
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,370
<7-7,Raj>如果艾米跟别的男人外出  你不会觉得不爽吗
<7-7,Raj>Wouldn't you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?

186
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,350
<7-7,Raj>不可能
<7-7,Raj>Can't happen.

187
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,990
<7-8,Sheldon>我们的恋爱协议无懈可击
<7-8,Sheldon>We have an ironclad relationship agreement

188
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,130
<7-8,Sheldon>里面规定了不许她跟我之外的男人
<7-8,Sheldon>which precludes her from physical contact

189
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,190
<7-8,Sheldon>发生任何身体上的接触
<7-8,Sheldon>with anyone other than me.

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,500
<7-9,Raj>但你也没跟她上床啊
<7-9,Raj>But you don't have sex with her, either.

191
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,610
<7-10,Sheldon>高招吧
<7-10,Sheldon>Slick, huh?

192
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,600
<7-11,Raj>老实说  我和艾米丽约会的时间不算长
<7-11,Raj>To be truthful, Emily and I haven't dated that long,

193
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,780
<7-11,Raj>我们也还没说好只跟对方处对象
<7-11,Raj>and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.

194
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,410
<7-12,Sheldon>那你们发生性关系了吗
<7-12,Sheldon>Have you had intercourse?

195
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,300
<7-13,Raj>没有
<7-13,Raj>No.

196
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,740
<7-14,Sheldon>坚持你的立场[收好你的"枪"]
<7-14,Sheldon>Well, stick to your guns.

197
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,750
<7-14,Sheldon>未来的路将会压力山大
<7-14,Sheldon>There will be a lot of pressure.

198
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,840
<8-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我又饿了
<8-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I'm hungry again!

199
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,020
<8-2,Howard>她就像全球最肥的咕咕钟
<8-2,Howard>It's like the world's fattest cuckoo clock.

200
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,610
<8-3,Bernadette>你总是希望有天能拥有孩子
<8-3,Bernadette>You know, you're always talking about having a baby someday.

201
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,700
<8-3,Bernadette>但有了孩子就会是这情况啊
<8-3,Bernadette>This is exactly what it's gonna be like.

202
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,260
<8-4,Howard>才不会呢
<8-4,Howard>No, it's not.

203
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,090
<8-5,Bernadette>怎么不会  整天哇哇叫  要吃  要拉
<8-5,Bernadette>Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping,

204
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,570
<8-5,Bernadette>打嗝  还流口水
<8-5,Bernadette>burping, drooling.

205
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,660
<8-5,Bernadette>连她哪天能开始走路
<8-5,Bernadette>We're even waiting for the day

206
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,120
<8-5,Bernadette>我们都还得慢慢盼着呢
<8-5,Bernadette>when she can finally walk on her own.

207
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,060
<8-6,Howard>也许你说得对
<8-6,Howard>Maybe you're right.

208
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,360
<8-6,Howard>还有在地上发现任何东西  也都直接塞嘴里
<8-6,Howard>Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.

209
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,650
<8-7,Bernadette>我只是提前告诉你  如果日后有孩子
<8-7,Bernadette>I'm just telling you now, if we do have kids,

210
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,800
<8-7,Bernadette>别指望老娘一个人干全部的活
<8-7,Bernadette>don't expect me to do all the work.

211
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,500
<8-8,Howard>我骨子里也是个慈父啊
<8-8,Howard>Hey, I'm a very paternal person.

212
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,570
<8-8,Howard>我一定很会照顾小孩
<8-8,Howard>I'd be excellent at taking care of a baby.

213
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,010
<8-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我还饿着呢
<8-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I'm still hungry!

214
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,140
<8-10,Howard>来啦  你个死老小孩
<8-10,Howard>I'm coming, you big baby!

215
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,530
<9-1,Penny>你们知道比拍一部会在屁股上
<9-1,Penny>You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie

216
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,580
<9-1,Penny>粘满猴子毛的电影还惨的是什么吗
<9-1,Penny>where they glue monkey hair to your ass

217
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,010
<9-1,Penny>是被一部会在屁股上
<9-1,Penny>is getting fired from a movie

218
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,710
<9-1,Penny>粘满猴子毛的电影给解雇
<9-1,Penny>where they glue monkey hair to your ass.

219
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,440
<9-2,Wil>算了啦  反正是大烂片
<9-2,Wil>Forget it, man, it's crap.

220
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
<9-2,Wil>迎接下一个角色就好了
<9-2,Wil>You just move on to the next thing.

221
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,450
<9-3,Penny>你当然能说得这么轻巧啦
<9-3,Penny>Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say.

222
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,340
<9-3,Penny>你是过气红星
<9-3,Penny>You used to be famous.

<9-5,Penny>行  对不起  你是当红影星
<9-5,Penny>You're right, I'm sorry, you're famous.

225
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,980
<9-6,Wil>佩妮  跟红不红无关
<9-6,Wil>Penny, it's not about being famous.

226
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,770
<9-6,Wil>重点是为了艺术
<9-6,Wil>It's about the art.

227
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,380
<9-6,Wil>是为艺术事业献身的热情
<9-6,Wil>It's about the passion we have for our craft.

228
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,750
<9-6,Wil>《鲨卷风》的续集找我去试镜
<9-6,Wil>I have an audition for Sharknado 2!

<9-6,Wil>要是我选上了  一定还你啤酒钱
<9-6,Wil>If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.

231
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,150
<9-7,Penny>天啊  我到底是在折腾什么啊
<9-7,Penny>God, what am I doing with my life?

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,260
<9-10,Leonard>话虽如此  但也不是总那么糟糕
<9-10,Leonard>Yeah, but it's not always that bad.

235
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,540
<9-11,Penny>是吗
<9-11,Penny>Oh, really?

236
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,900

<9-13,Penny>什么剧场  那是在保龄球场
<9-13,Penny>It was over a bowling alley.

239
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,570
<9-14,Leonard>没错  可是
<9-14,Leonard>Yeah, but...

240
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,430
<9-14,Leonard>停车位还挺足的
<9-14,Leonard>there was ample parking.

241
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,960
<9-15,Penny>你说完了吗
<9-15,Penny>Are you done?

242

<9-16,Leonard>你的电视广告也拍得相当赞啊
<9-16,Leonard>And you were so good in the TV commercial.

243
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,000
<9-17,Penny>那是支痔疮膏广告
<9-17,Penny>It was for hemorrhoid cream.

244
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,040
<9-18,Leonard>我光看你演就又痒又肿了
<9-18,Leonard>And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.

<9-19,Penny>莱纳德  你这么说我是真心笑不出来
<9-19,Penny>Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.

246
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,400
<9-19,Penny>别这样
<9-19,Penny>Come on.

247
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,890
<9-20,Leonard>身边有我这种身长168的大帅哥
<9-20,Leonard>How can you be sad when you're going home

248
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,380
<9-20,Leonard>你怎么能不开心嘛

<13-10,Leonard>Why?

368
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,510
<13-10,Leonard>因为我是"明智的决定"吗
<13-10,Leonard>Because I'm a-a "smart decision"?

369
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,180
<13-11,Penny>是的
<13-11,Penny>Well, yeah.

370
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,000
<13-12,Leonard>这么说我是麦麸松糕[较为健康]
<13-12,Leonard>So I'm like a bran muffin.

00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,500
<13-13,Penny>什么  我不是这个意思
<13-13,Penny>What...No, that's not what I'm saying.

<13-14,Leonard>不  你就是这个意思
<13-14,Leonard>No, it's exactly what you're saying.

00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,400
<13-14,Leonard>你选择我这个无趣的选项
<13-14,Leonard>I'm the boring thing you're choosing

374
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,730
<13-14,Leonard>是因为我对你有益
<13-14,Leonard>because I'm good for you.

375
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,530
<13-15,Penny>这有什么关系
<13-15,Penny>What does it matter?

376
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,160
<13-15,Penny>重点是  我选了你
<13-15,Penny>The point is, I'm choosing you.

377
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,480
<13-16,Leonard>太有关系了
<13-16,Leonard>Well, it matters a lot!

378
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,540
<13-16,Leonard>我不想做麦麸松糕
<13-16,Leonard>I don't want to be a bran muffin.

<13-16,Leonard>我要做
<13-16,Leonard>I-I want to be a...

<13-16,Leonard>Cinnabon, you know?

381
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,810
<13-16,Leonard>或草莓夹心饼干
<13-16,Leonard>A strawberry Pop-Tart.

382
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,270
<13-16,Leonard>你想到我就会兴奋
<13-16,Leonard>Something you're excited about

383
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,110
<13-16,Leonard>哪怕我会害你得糖尿病
<13-16,Leonard>even though it could give you diabetes.

384
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,470
<13-17,Penny>亲爱的  你想做任何糕饼点心都行
<13-17,Penny>Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.

<13-18,Leonard>不不  太迟了
<13-18,Leonard>No, no. No, it's too late.

<13-18,Leonard>我是你的麦麸松糕
<13-18,Leonard>I-I'm your bran muffin.

387
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,570
<13-18,Leonard>可能无脂肪  有利于结肠健康
<13-18,Leonard>Probably fat-free and good for your colon.

388
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,900
<13-19,Penny>这样吧  算了
<13-19,Penny>You know what? Forget it.

389
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,180
<13-19,Penny>我就不应该提这事
<13-19,Penny>I never should've brought it up.

390
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,690
<13-20,Leonard>你知道我想娶你
<13-20,Leonard>You know I want to marry you,

391
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,480
<13-20,Leonard>但你现在这样  只是因为你被炒了
<13-20,Leonard>but you're only doing this because you got fired

392
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,210
<13-20,Leonard>你为自己感到难过
<13-20,Leonard>and you're feeling sorry for yourself.

393
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,600
<13-21,Penny>看起来是这样  但被这部电影炒掉
<13-21,Penny>Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie

394
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,230
<13-21,Penny>是我这辈子最幸运的一件事
<13-21,Penny>was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay?

395
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,680
<13-21,Penny>我终于意识到  我不需要出名
<13-21,Penny>I finally realize I don't need to be famous

396
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,530
<13-21,Penny>不需要演艺事业腾飞来令我幸福
<13-21,Penny>or have some big career to be happy.

397
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,730
<13-22,Leonard>那你需要什么
<13-22,Leonard>Then what do you need?

398
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,280
<13-23,Penny>你啊  你这个笨夹心饼干
<13-23,Penny>You, you stupid pop-tart!

00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,970
<13-24,Leonard>那我想我愿意
<13-24,Leonard>Then I guess I'm in.

400
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,080
<13-24,Leonard>你不是吧
<13-24,Leonard>Really?

401
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,170
<13-25,Penny>你"想你愿意"
<13-25,Penny>You "guess you're in"?

402
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,330
<13-26,Leonard>不是勉强的"我想我愿意"
<13-26,Leonard>Not like, "I guess I'm in."

403
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,100
<13-26,Leonard>而是激动的"我想...我愿意"
<13-26,Leonard>Like "I guess... I'm in!"

404
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,900
<13-26,Leonard>好的
<13-26,Leonard>Okay.

405
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,260
<13-27,Penny>酷
<13-27,Penny>Cool.

406
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,550
<13-28,Leonard>就这样吗
<13-28,Leonard>So is that it?

407
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,740
<13-28,Leonard>我们订婚了吗
<13-28,Leonard>Are... are we engaged?

408
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,560
<13-29,Penny>大概吧
<13-29,Penny>Yeah, I think so.

409
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,280
<13-30,Leonard>好的
<13-30,Leonard>All right.

410
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,210
<13-31,Penny>怎么啦
<13-31,Penny>What's wrong?

411
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,520
<13-32,Leonard>我不知道
<13-32,Leonard>I'm not sure.

412
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,020
<13-32,Leonard>感觉有点虎头蛇尾的
<13-32,Leonard>Just... feels a little anticlimactic.

413
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,650
<13-33,Penny>是有点那种感觉
<13-33,Penny>Yeah, it kind of does, huh?

414
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,380
<13-34,Leonard>我知道了
<13-34,Leonard>Oh, I know.

415
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,400
<13-34,Leonard>这个也许有帮助
<13-34,Leonard>This might help.

416
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,240
<13-35,Penny>你在哪里弄的戒指
<13-35,Penny>Where did you get a ring?

417
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,910
<13-35,Penny>我
<13-35,Penny>I've...

418
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,070
<13-36,Leonard>已经买了几年了  这不重要
<13-36,Leonard>had it for a couple years, not important.

<13-37,Penny>Oh, my God, yes.

422
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,050
<13-38,Leonard>如果你手指上没有猩猩毛
<13-38,Leonard>This would have been so much more romantic

423
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,690
<13-38,Leonard>这个求婚仪式会浪漫许多
<13-38,Leonard>if you didn't have monkey hair on your finger.
