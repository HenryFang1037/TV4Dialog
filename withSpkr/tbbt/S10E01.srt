<2-8,Beverley>of planning a second wedding ceremony for me,

88
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,150
<2-8,Beverley>但很遗憾  我不能参加

<2-11,Beverley>I just cannot stay here

93
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,840
<2-11,Beverley>你父亲摆明了就是要羞辱我
<2-11,Beverley>while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,000
<2-12,Sheldon>天啊  他怎么羞辱你了
<2-12,Sheldon>Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,150
<2-13,Beverley>少来了  谢尔顿
<2-13,Beverley>Stop it, Sheldon.

96
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,810
<2-14,Sheldon>我是接"少来什么"  还是该停止装傻了
<2-14,Sheldon>Do I say "stop what?" or just throw in the towel?

97
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,550
<2-15,Beverley>我想不到我为什么要留下看你父亲
<2-15,Beverley>I don't see why I should have to watch your father

98
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,450
<2-15,Beverley>拉着一个土掉渣圣经狂招摇过市
<2-15,Beverley>parade around with some Bible-thumping bumpkin.

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,380
<2-16,Sheldon>喂喂喂  你刚才说的人可是我母亲

101
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,460
<2-16,Sheldon>贝弗莉
<2-16,Sheldon>Okay, Beverly,

102
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,740
<2-17,Penny>你是不是有点反应过度了
<2-17,Penny>aren't you overreacting a little?

103
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,100
<2-17,Penny>他们只是一起打车并喝了杯睡前酒嘛
<2-17,Penny>All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.

104
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,400
<2-18,Sheldon>还把手机关机了
<2-18,Sheldon>And turned their phones off.

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,850
<2-19,Leonard>越帮越忙啊  兄弟

<2-20,Penny>阿尔弗雷德就知道他成功激怒你了
<2-20,Penny>Alfred will know he got under your skin.

110
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,630
<2-21,Beverley>的确不能这么满足他
<2-21,Beverley>Well, we can't have that.

111
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,480
<2-22,Sheldon>而且  如果他们真的交媾了
<2-22,Sheldon>You know, also, if they did have coitus,

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,090
<2-22,Sheldon>我们都需要个厉害的心理医生开导
<2-22,Sheldon>we'll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.

113
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,540
<3-1,Raj>其实回想起来还挺搞笑的
<3-1,Raj>It is funny when you think about it.

<3-2,Howard>五百块的罚单又不是你付钱
<3-2,Howard>You didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.

116
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,830
<3-3,Bernadette>那是因为你像个疯子一样乱飙车
<3-3,Bernadette>Because you were driving like a lunatic.

117
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,920
<3-4,Howard>如果觉得有政府秘密特务
<3-4,Howard>Hey, if thinking secret government agents

<3-6,Bernadette>警察把你拦下来的时候
<3-6,Bernadette>It didn't help that you couldn't walk a straight line

122
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,890
<3-6,Bernadette>你走不了直线  也只能怪自己啊
<3-6,Bernadette>when the cop pulled you over.

123
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,590
<3-7,Howard>我有表现焦虑症啊
<3-7,Howard>I have performance anxiety.

124
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,320
<3-7,Howard>你应该最懂越要我"表现"我越焦虑啊
<3-7,Howard>You of all people should know that.

<4-15,Randall>佩妮知道我在哪儿蹲  她还给我寄过香烟呢
<4-15,Randall>Penny knows where I was; she sent me cigarettes.

209
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,040
<6-14,Alfred>好
<6-14,Alfred>Good.

210
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,170
<6-18,Sheldon>你到底有没有玷污我妈
<6-18,Sheldon>So, did you defile my mother or not?

211
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,390
<6-18,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<6-18,Sheldon>Sheldon!

212
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,070
<6-19,Mary>你真是太失礼了
<6-19,Mary>You're being rude.

213
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,740
<6-20,Alfred>容我说一句  你大可放心
<6-20,Alfred>If I may, I can assure you,

214
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,200
<6-20,Alfred>我和你母亲只是
<6-20,Alfred>your mother and I did nothing more

215
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,970
<6-20,Alfred>一起打车一起聊天  绝无任何越举行为
<6-20,Alfred>than share a cab and a conversation.

216
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,760
<6-21,Sheldon>你们聊天的内容有这句话吗
<6-21,Sheldon>Did that conversation include the phrase

217
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,870
<6-21,Sheldon>"你的生殖器真是赏心悦目"
<6-21,Sheldon>"Your genitals are a joy to behold"?

218
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,060
<6-22,Mary>够了
<6-22,Mary>That's enough!

219
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,700
<6-23,Alfred>听着  我保证  无论是我
<6-23,Alfred>Look, I promise you, neither I,

220
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,470
<6-23,Alfred>或是任何人  都从未说过这句话
<6-23,Alfred>nor anyone, has ever said that.

221
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,370
<6-24,Leonard>看来你跟他女朋友不是很熟
<6-24,Leonard>You don't know his girlfriend very well.

222
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,560
<6-25,Sheldon>也不熟悉我生殖器赏心悦目的程度
<6-25,Sheldon>Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.

223
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,230
<7-1,Penny>好了  你们先放好行李
<7-1,Penny>All right, you guys, uh, get settled in,

224
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,300
<7-1,Penny>然后我们就过对面跟大家打声招呼
<7-1,Penny>then we'll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.

225
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,870
<7-2,Randall>难以置信我从来没见过莱纳德
<7-2,Randall>You know, It's hard to believe I've never met Leonard.

226
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,350
<7-3,Wyatt>估计他的违禁毒品
<7-3,Wyatt>Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs

227
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,360
<7-3,Wyatt>都是找地头蛇买的
<7-3,Wyatt>from a local vendor.

228
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,760
<7-4,Susan>不好笑  怀亚特
<7-4,Susan>Not funny, Wyatt.

229
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,120
<7-5,Penny>-我觉得很好笑啊  -谢谢
<7-5,Penny>- I thought it was really funny. - Thanks.

230
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,550
<7-7,Susan>好啊  如果大家都想拿我们的家丑开玩笑
<7-7,Susan>Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems,

231
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,020
<7-7,Susan>那我也行啊
<7-7,Susan>then I can, too.

232
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,810
<7-7,Susan>咚咚  是谁敲门呀
<7-7,Susan>Knock, knock. Who's there?

233
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,760
<7-7,Susan>我们家就是个笑话
<7-7,Susan>Our family is an embarrassment.

234
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,930
<7-8,Randall>-这算不上是笑话啊  -好了
<7-8,Randall>- That's not much of a joke. - Okay.

235
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,360
<7-9,Penny>妈  我知道你紧张  但我保证
<7-9,Penny>Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous, but I promise you,

236
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,710
<7-9,Penny>不会有人戴有色眼镜看你或我们家
<7-9,Penny>no one is gonna judge you or this family.

237
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,350
<7-9,Penny>对不起
<7-9,Penny>Oh, I'm sorry.

238
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,770
<7-10,Susan>只是我们是第一次见莱纳德父母
<7-10,Susan>It's just we're meeting Leonard's parents for the first time,

239
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,080
<7-10,Susan>他们是学界精英  还是知识分子
<7-10,Susan>and-and they're academics and-and intellectuals,

240
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,890
<7-10,Susan>我不想让他们觉得我们是垃圾白人
<7-10,Susan>and I don't want them thinking we're white trash.

241
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,790
<7-11,Randall>那你觉得他们会比较信任什么颜色的垃圾
<7-11,Randall>Well, what color trash do you think they'll believe?

242
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,020
<8-1,Mary>你怎么能认为我会跟
<8-1,Mary>How could you think that I would spend the night

243
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,190
<8-1,Mary>刚认识的男人过夜呢
<8-1,Mary>with a man I just met?

244
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,520
<8-2,Sheldon>一个叫耶稣的男人
<8-2,Sheldon>A man named Jesus

245
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,240
<8-2,Sheldon>让你掏钱在非洲盖了一座教堂
<8-2,Sheldon>convinced you to build a church in Africa.

246
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,040
<8-2,Sheldon>你就是这么好骗
<8-2,Sheldon>You're kind of a sucker.

247
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,770
<8-3,Leonard>啥事也没发生  对吧
<8-3,Leonard>Well, nothing happened, right?

248
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,920
<8-3,Leonard>所以一切到此为止
<8-3,Leonard>I-It's over.

249
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,110
<8-3,Leonard>除非我俩再办第三次婚礼
<8-3,Leonard>Until we get married a third time,

250
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,370
<8-3,Leonard>否则你们永远不会再见到彼此了
<8-3,Leonard>you guys will never have to see each other again.

251
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,720
<8-4,Alfred>这个倒不一定
<8-4,Alfred>Well, you know, actually that's not the case.

252
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,770
<8-4,Alfred>玛丽之后可能会来纽约看我
<8-4,Alfred>Mary may visit me in New York.

253
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,080
<8-5,Mary>他也从来没去过德州
<8-5,Mary>And he's never been to Texas.

254
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,760
<8-6,Alfred>我们可以约在中间见面
<8-6,Alfred>Maybe we meet halfway.

255
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,530
<8-7,Sheldon>你俩要在乔治亚州的查塔国家森林公园见面吗
<8-7,Sheldon>What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia?

256
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,110
<8-7,Sheldon>不可能只有我知道那是纽约和德州的中间点吧
<8-7,Sheldon>I can't be the only one that knows that's halfway.

257
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,320
<8-8,Beverley>你们不会真的想要继续见面吧
<8-8,Beverley>You're not seriously going to visit each other.

258
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,410
<8-9,Alfred>为什么不呢
<8-9,Alfred>And why wouldn't we?

259
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,610
<8-10,Beverley>拜托  你不过就是想激怒我而已
<8-10,Beverley>Oh, please, you're just saying this to antagonize me.

260
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,730
<8-10,Beverley>才怪
<8-10,Beverley>Not at all.

261
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,570
<8-11,Alfred>玛丽可是个好女人
<8-11,Alfred>Mary happens to be a wonderful woman.

262
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,320
<8-11,Alfred>如果这激怒了你  那算一石二鸟
<8-11,Alfred>And if it antagonizes you, tothat's just a bonus.

263
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,300
<8-12,Leonard>玛丽  抱歉把你扯到这些破事上来
<8-12,Leonard>Mary, I'm sorry you're in the middle of this.

264
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,310
<8-13,Mary>不  不用道歉
<8-13,Mary>No, no, nothing to be sorry about.

265
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,600
<8-13,Mary>我是真的很喜欢你爸爸
<8-13,Mary>I genuinely like your father.

266
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,500
<8-14,Sheldon>喜欢他什么  他只是个平庸的学者
<8-14,Sheldon>What? But he's a mediocre academic.

267
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,580
<8-14,Sheldon>而且贝弗莉说他的床技低于平均线呢
<8-14,Sheldon>And according to Beverly, his sexual prowess is subpar.

268
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,980
<8-14,Sheldon>他根本就是一个前列腺肥大版的莱纳德嘛
<8-14,Sheldon>He's basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.

269
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,140
<8-15,Leonard>你是说我爸配不上你妈吗
<8-15,Leonard>Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom?

270
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,260
<8-16,Sheldon>没错  我还同时好好挖苦了你一番
<8-16,Sheldon>Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you.

271
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,860
<8-16,Sheldon>这才叫一石二鸟
<8-16,Sheldon>Pretty efficient, huh?

272
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,910
<8-17,Leonard>这实在太荒唐了  我要去对面屋待一会
<8-17,Leonard>This is ridiculous. I-I'm going across the hall.

273
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,360
<8-18,Sheldon>凭什么你可以走掉
<8-18,Sheldon>But why should you get to go

274
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,830
<8-18,Sheldon>却留下我和你吵个不停的父母在一起
<8-18,Sheldon>and leave me here with your bickering parents?

275
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,900
<8-19,Leonard>好  那你走吧
<8-19,Leonard>Fine, then you go!

276
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,400
<8-20,Mary>我不想和她同处一室  我走
<8-20,Mary>Well, I don't want to stay here with her. I'll go.

277
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,030
<8-21,Alfred>我和你一起走
<8-21,Alfred>I'll go with you.

278
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,390
<8-22,Leonard>那不还是把我和他留在这里了吗

330
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,300
<11-1,Howard>一定没好事
<11-1,Howard>It has to be bad news.

<11-8,Raj>拜托  你去见面的最坏结果会是什么
<11-8,Raj>Oh, come on. What's the worst that could come of this meeting?

338
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,110
<11-9,Howard>我不知道  他们抢走我的发明

339
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,310
<11-9,Howard>我人财两空
<11-9,Howard>and I get nothing?

340
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,320
<11-10,Raj>这也不算最坏啊

<11-10,Raj>他们见不得光
<11-10,Raj>They had to live in secret,

345
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,420
<11-10,Raj>而当物理学家奥本海默拒绝
<11-10,Raj>and when Oppenheimer objected

<13-20,Bernadette>爱是耐心
<13-20,Bernadette>Love is patient,

394
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,450
<13-20,Bernadette>但不代表就会容忍有人在底下叽叽喳喳
<13-20,Bernadette>but it's not gonna put up with all the side chatter,

395
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,270
<13-20,Bernadette>所以把嘴闭上
<13-20,Bernadette>so let's knock it off!

396
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,060
<13-21,Howard>好歹她终于换个人吼吼了
<13-21,Howard>At least she's yelling at someone else for a change.

397
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,480
<13-22,Bernadette>霍华德
<13-22,Bernadette>Howard!

398
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,660
<13-23,Penny>好了  我知道大家今天都有点神经紧绷
<13-23,Penny>Okay, I understand everyone's a little tense today,

399
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,160
<13-23,Penny>所以我就直接跳到重点部分吧
<13-23,Penny>so I am just gonna get to the important stuff.

400
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,520
<13-23,Penny>莱纳德  与你一起在这里
<13-23,Penny>Leonard, standing here with you

401
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,860
<13-23,Penny>站在我们亲朋好友的面前
<13-23,Penny>in front of our family and friends

402
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,280
<13-23,Penny>我内心感慨万千
<13-23,Penny>is bringing up a lot of feelings.

403
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,940
<13-23,Penny>比如想到我们第一次私奔结婚是多好的主意
<13-23,Penny>Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time.

404
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,550
<13-23,Penny>但也想到你让我无比快乐
<13-23,Penny>But also how incredibly happy you make me.

405
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,070
<13-23,Penny>谢谢你娶了我
<13-23,Penny>Thank you for marrying me.

406
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,170
<13-23,Penny>希望这是你最后一次娶我了
<13-23,Penny>Hopefully for the last time.

407
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,900
<13-23,Penny>佩妮
<13-23,Penny>Penny...

408
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,250
<13-24,Leonard>作为一名科学家
<13-24,Leonard>as a scientist,

409
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,560
<13-24,Leonard>我的职责是搞懂事物发生的原因
<13-24,Leonard>my job is to figure out why things happen.

410
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,520
<13-24,Leonard>但我想我永远搞不懂
<13-24,Leonard>But I don't think I'll ever understand

411
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,840
<13-24,Leonard>我这样的凡夫俗子
<13-24,Leonard>how someone like me

412
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,800
<13-24,Leonard>怎能有幸与你共度一生
<13-24,Leonard>could get to be with someone like you.

413
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,150
<13-24,Leonard>或许...  或许我不需要搞懂
<13-24,Leonard>You know... maybe... I don't need to understand it,

414
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,320
<13-25,Penny>我只需感谢天赐良缘
<13-25,Penny>I just need to be grateful.

415
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,630
<13-25,Penny>我爱你  佩妮
<13-25,Penny>I love you, Penny.

416
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,070
<13-26,Bernadette>有人对此有啥毒舌言论要发表吗
<13-26,Bernadette>Anybody have anything snarky to say about that?

417
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,750
<13-26,Bernadette>我也觉得不会有
<13-26,Bernadette>Didn't think so.

418
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,740
<13-27,Alfred>我想说两句
<13-27,Alfred>I'd like to say something.

419
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,680
<14-3,Alfred>贝弗莉
<14-3,Alfred>Beverly,

420
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,840
<13-27,Alfred>我知道我们没有把最好的一面呈现给对方
<13-27,Alfred>I know that we don't bring out the best in each other.

421
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,800
<13-27,Alfred>但我们的结合还是带来了一件美好事物
<13-27,Alfred>But something wonderful did come from our relationship:

422
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,270
<13-28,Beverley>就是前面这个好小伙
<13-28,Beverley>that young man right there.

423
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,620
<13-28,Beverley>我非常同意
<13-28,Beverley>I couldn't agree more.

424
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,350
<13-29,Stuart>太感人了
<13-29,Stuart>That's beautiful.

425
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,360
<13-30,Bernadette>谢谢  好了  我们继续
<13-30,Bernadette>Thank you. All right, let's continue.

426
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,790
<13-31,Sheldon>抱歉  我也有话想对
<13-31,Sheldon>Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something

427
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,730
<13-31,Sheldon>一位很特别的人说  而且...
<13-31,Sheldon>to someone pretty special, and...

428
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,180
<13-31,Sheldon>我一刻都不想等了
<13-31,Sheldon>I just can't wait any longer.

429
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,870
<13-32,Amy>守得云开见月明啊
<13-32,Amy>It's happening.

430
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,300
<13-32,Amy>莱纳德
<13-32,Amy>Leonard...

431
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,850
<13-33,Sheldon>你我之间起起伏伏  有好有坏
<13-33,Sheldon>You and I have our ups and downs.

432
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,940
<13-33,Sheldon>但一直以来我始终把你当家人看待
<13-33,Sheldon>But I have always considered you my family.

433
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,050
<13-33,Sheldon>连最近我们的父母如两只老兔子般疯狂交配
<13-33,Sheldon>Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating

434
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,500
<13-33,Sheldon>也没有威胁到这份情谊
<13-33,Sheldon>like wrinkly old rabbits.

435
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,820
<13-33,Sheldon>虽然我不常表现出来
<13-33,Sheldon>I don't always show it,

436
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,640
<13-33,Sheldon>但你对我无比重要
<13-33,Sheldon>but you are of great importance to me.

437
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,510
<13-33,Sheldon>你们俩都是
<13-33,Sheldon>Both of you.

438
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,150
<13-34,Penny>谢谢
<13-34,Penny>Thank you.

439
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,780
<13-35,Leonard>好了
<13-35,Leonard>Okay.

440
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,300
<13-36,Bernadette>我现在宣布你们为夫妻
<13-36,Bernadette>I now pronounce you husband and wife.

441
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,330
<13-36,Bernadette>外加随公寓附赠的另一位怪丈夫
<13-36,Bernadette>And weird other husband who came with the apartment.

442
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,910
<14-1,Beverley>谢谢你载我们去机场
<14-1,Beverley>Thank you for taking us to the airport.

443
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,240
<14-2,Leonard>我很开心我们一家能和平共处一会儿
<14-2,Leonard>Hey, I'm just thrilled we're all getting along for a minute.

444
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,570
<14-3,Alfred>我也是
<14-3,Alfred>Yeah, me, too.

445
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,000
<14-3,Alfred>贝弗莉  我如果惹你不开心了  对不起
<14-3,Alfred>Beverly, I'm sorry if I upset you.

446
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,920
<14-4,Beverley>过了就算了  阿尔弗雷德
<14-4,Beverley>Water under the bridge, Alfred.

447
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,050
<14-4,Beverley>莱纳德  你为什么不开上共乘车道
<14-4,Beverley>Leonard, why don't you get into the carpool lane?

448
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,020
<14-5,Alfred>那里是实线 他不能切过去
<14-5,Alfred>Well, that's a solid line. He can't cross it.

449
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,420
<14-6,Leonard>没事  我可以切过去
<14-6,Leonard>That's okay. I can make it over.

450
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,890
<14-7,Beverley>不必不必  就慢悠悠地开吧
<14-7,Beverley>No, no, let's plod along.

451
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,620
<14-7,Beverley>这么开你父亲会舒服点
<14-7,Beverley>It'll make your father feel more comfortable.

452
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,400
<14-8,Alfred>真正让我感到舒心的是想到
<14-8,Alfred>What makes me comfortable is knowing I don't have to

453
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,430
<14-8,Alfred>明早不用一起床  就看见你那张臭脸
<14-8,Alfred>wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.

454
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,110
<14-9,Beverley>善待这个世界  明早别醒来了
<14-9,Beverley>Do the world a favor and don't wake up tomorrow morning.

455
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,200
<14-10,Leonard>和平了快整整一分钟呢
<14-10,Leonard>That was almost a minute.

456
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,110
<15-1,Mary>好多车啊  不会赶不上吧
<15-1,Mary>There's a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?

457
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,900
<15-2,Amy>你会在你飞机起飞前一个小时到达机场
<15-2,Amy>You'll be at the airport an hour before your flight.

458
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,970
<15-3,Mary>很好  谢谢
<15-3,Mary>Good. Thank you.

459
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,230
<15-4,Sheldon>有足够时间让你再找一个"老"白脸
<15-4,Sheldon>Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.

460
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,480
<15-5,Mary>我不许你不尊重我
<15-5,Mary>Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.

461
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,980
<15-6,Sheldon>是的  母亲大人

<15-7,Amy>谢尔顿  你的母亲是一位很有魅力的女子
<15-7,Amy>Sheldon, your mother's an attractive woman.

463
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,160
<15-7,Amy>你得习惯
<15-7,Amy>You need to get used to the fact

464
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,130
<15-7,Amy>男人们会对她趋之若鹜
<15-7,Amy>that men are gonna be interested in her.

465
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,760
<15-8,Sheldon>你也得闭嘴开车  少多管闲事
<15-8,Sheldon>And you need to drive the car and mind your business.

466
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,340
<15-9,Amy>我也不许你不尊重我
<15-9,Amy>I will not have you be disrespectful to me.

467
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,320
<15-10,Sheldon>你又不是我妈
<15-10,Sheldon>What-- you're not my mother.

468
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,860
<15-11,Mary>你不许不尊重她
<15-11,Mary>Don't you be disrespectful to her!

<15-13,Mary>You'll get there, you've just got to put some zing on it.

471
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,190
<16-1,Susan>佩妮  我真不知道我之前瞎担心什么
<16-1,Susan>Penny, I don't know what I was worried about.

472
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,760
<16-1,Susan>你的朋友们都很讨人喜欢啊
<16-1,Susan>Your friends are just lovely.

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,360
<16-2,Penny>谢谢啊  妈妈
<16-2,Penny>Oh, thanks, Mom.

474
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,260
<16-3,Susan>除了那个谢尔顿有点"特别"
<16-3,Susan>Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,000
<16-4,Penny>是吗  从来没注意到啊
<16-4,Penny>Is he? I never noticed.

00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,290
<16-5,Wyatt>他让我想起我们家养过的那只火鸡
<16-5,Wyatt>He reminds me of that turkey we had

477
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,490
<16-5,Wyatt>看雨看到被雨水呛死了
<16-5,Wyatt>who drowned looking up at the rain.
