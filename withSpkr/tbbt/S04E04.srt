1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,080
<1-1,Raj>我告诉你  如果氙能放射出紫外线
<1-1,Raj>I'm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light,

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,470
<1-1,Raj>那些有关暗物质的发现都会是错的
<1-1,Raj>then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,380
<1-2,Sheldon>那是  如果我们住在一个
<1-2,Sheldon>Yes, well, if we lived in a world

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,290
<1-2,Sheldon>缓慢运动的氙原子能放出光子的世界
<1-2,Sheldon>where slow-moving xenon produced light,

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,340
<1-2,Sheldon>那你就是对的
<1-2,Sheldon>then you'd be correct.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,960
<1-2,Sheldon>与此同时  猪能飞
<1-2,Sheldon>Also, pigs would fly,

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,410
<1-2,Sheldon>我也能拉出棉花糖来
<1-2,Sheldon>my derriere would produce cotton candy,

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,180
<1-2,Sheldon>而《幽灵的威胁》也将成为永恒的经典
<1-2,Sheldon>and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,340
<1-3,Raj>你也太傲慢了
<1-3,Raj>Oh, you're so arrogant.

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,330
<1-3,Raj>如果你是超级英雄
<1-3,Raj>If you were a superhero,

12
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,060
<1-3,Raj>那你的名字就该叫傲慢上尉
<1-3,Raj>your name would be Captain Arrogant.

13
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,070
<1-3,Raj>你知道你的超能力是什么吗
<1-3,Raj>And you know what your superpower would be?

14
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,730
<1-4,Sheldon>傲慢力
<1-4,Sheldon>Arrogance.

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,800
<1-4,Sheldon>你又错了
<1-4,Sheldon>You're wrong again.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,580
<1-4,Sheldon>如果我的超能力是傲慢力
<1-4,Sheldon>If my superpower were arrogance,

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,440
<1-4,Sheldon>我的名字应该是至傲博士
<1-4,Sheldon>my name would be Dr. Arroganto.

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,220
<1-5,Howard (laughs)>我太喜欢看拉杰和谢尔顿一块儿工作了
<1-5,Howard (laughs)>I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,430
<1-6,Leonard>没错  就好比异形和铁血战士决定
<1-6,Leonard>Yeah, it's like if Alien and Predator decided

20
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,780
<1-6,Leonard>合作开一间Jamba Juice一样
<1-6,Leonard>to go partners in a Jamba Juice.

22
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,520
<1-7,Raj>你难道没注意宏观的状况吗
<1-7,Raj>Has it occurred to you you're missing the big picture?

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,500
<1-7,Raj>-如果你看了中子分布数据  -佩妮
<1-7,Raj>- If you look at neutron scattering data...  - Oh, Penny?

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
<1-9,Penny>-佩妮  -怎么了
<1-9,Penny>- Penny?  - What's up?

25
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,640
<1-10,Sheldon>没事儿  我只是想让拉杰闭嘴而已
<1-10,Sheldon>Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,260
<1-11,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>不不不
<1-11,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>No, no, no.

27
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,210
<1-11,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>他赢了  憋着吧
<1-11,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>He won. Suck it up.

28
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,480
<1-12,Penny>我想问问你们是否需要甜品
<1-12,Penny>Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert,

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,390
<1-12,Penny>但我知道谢尔顿周二不吃甜品
<1-12,Penny>but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays.

30
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,210
<1-12,Penny>而拉杰就算想要什么也开不了口
<1-12,Penny>And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me.

31
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,320
<1-12,Penny>霍华德什么都不会点
<1-12,Penny>Howard won't order anything,

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,280
<1-12,Penny>但他会迸出来一些跟派或者芝士蛋糕
<1-12,Penny>but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,910
<1-12,Penny>有关系的恶心话
<1-12,Penny>involving the words pie or cheesecake.

34
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,360
<1-12,Penny>而莱纳德有乳糖不耐
<1-12,Penny>And Leonard's lactose intolerant,

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,500
<1-12,Penny>所以除非他想让自己的肠子
<1-12,Penny>so he can't eat anything here

36
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,490
<1-12,Penny>涨得跟动物气球似的  否则是什么都吃不了的
<1-12,Penny>without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,130
<1-13,Leonard>等等
<1-13,Leonard>Hang on a second.

38
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,710
<1-13,Leonard>我可以点水果拼盘的
<1-13,Leonard>I could have the fruit platter.

39
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,730
<1-14,Penny>你想要水果拼盘
<1-14,Penny>You want the fruit platter?

40
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,080
<1-15,Leonard>-上面有甜瓜吗  -有
<1-15,Leonard>- Does it have melon on it?  - Yeah.

41
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,860
<1-17,Leonard>呃  我不能吃甜瓜
<1-17,Leonard>No, I can't eat melon.

42
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,330
<1-18,Penny>霍华德  注意了
<1-18,Penny>Oh, Howard, heads up.

43
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,930
<1-18,Penny>你的前女友来上班了
<1-18,Penny>Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.

44
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,680
<1-19,Leonard>你上次见她是什么时候
<1-19,Leonard>When was the last time you saw her?

45
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,100
<1-20,Howard>分手之后就没见过了
<1-20,Howard>Oh, not since we broke up.

46
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,000
<1-20,Howard>嗯  我该怎么表现呢
<1-20,Howard>Wow. How am I going to play this?

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,980
<1-20,Howard>优雅而自然的
<1-20,Howard>Sophisticated and relaxed?

48
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,540
<1-20,Howard>还是友好而含糊的
<1-20,Howard>Friendly, noncommittal?

49
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,140
<1-20,Howard>或者冷淡且陌生的
<1-20,Howard>Cold and distant?

50
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,580
<1-21,Bernadette>你们好
<1-21,Bernadette>Hi, guys.

51
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,470
<2-2,Katee Sackhoff>你好
<2-2,Katee Sackhoff>Hello.

52
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,550
<1-23,Sheldon>看来你决定用悲剧和惊恐来面对了
<1-23,Sheldon>I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,290
<1-24,Raj>这是他的拿手好戏
<1-24,Raj>It's one of his best moves.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
<1-24,Raj>生活大爆炸
<1-24,Raj>第四季第四集

55
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,820
<2-1,Howard>亲爱的  我们又见面了
<2-1,Howard>So, my dear, we meet again.

56
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,440
<2-2,Katee Sackhoff>好啊  霍华德
<2-2,Katee Sackhoff>Hello, Howard.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,920
<2-2,Katee Sackhoff>我想你了
<2-2,Katee Sackhoff>I've missed you.

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,150
<2-3,Howard>我也想你了  凯蒂·萨克霍夫
<2-3,Howard>I've missed you, Katee Sackhoff.

60
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,200
<2-4,Katee Sackhoff>-问个问题  -随便问
<2-4,Katee Sackhoff>- One question.  - Anything.

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,810
<2-6,Katee Sackhoff>为什么我会在床上穿着《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》的战斗服
<2-6,Katee Sackhoff>Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,250
<2-7,Howard>那你又为什么你会和我同床呢
<2-7,Howard>Why are you in bed with me?

63
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,610
<2-7,Howard>如果我们开始质疑这个  那就太崩溃了
<2-7,Howard>If we start to question this, it all falls apart.

64
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,990
<2-7,Howard>不好意思
<2-7,Howard>Sorry.

65
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,020
<2-8,Katee Sackhoff>噢  强力地占有我吧  霍华德
<2-8,Katee Sackhoff>Oh, ravish me, Howard.

66
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,320
<2-8,Katee Sackhoff>我愿为你尽折腰
<2-8,Katee Sackhoff>My loins ache for you.

67
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,410
<2-9,Howard>好吧  既然你如此坚持的话
<2-9,Howard>Okay, if you insist.

68
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,710
<2-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>霍华德  你看到我的束腹紧身裤了吗
<2-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Howard, have you seen my girdle?!

69
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,080
<2-11,Howard>没有  妈
<2-11,Howard>No, Ma!

70
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,660
<2-12,Mrs Wolowitz>我找不着了  而且减肥族大会就快要迟到了
<2-12,Mrs Wolowitz>I can't find it, and I'm late for my Weight Watchers meeting!

71
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,510
<2-13,Howard>也许它自杀了
<2-13,Howard>Maybe it committed suicide!

72
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,230
<2-13,Howard>少烦我
<2-13,Howard>Leave me alone!

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,890
<2-13,Howard>好了  刚才到哪儿了
<2-13,Howard>Now, where were we?

74
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,690
<2-14,Bernadette>我觉得你想要
<2-14,Bernadette>I believe you were about

75
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,440
<2-14,Bernadette>用你的牙齿扒下我的制服了
<2-14,Bernadette>to rip off my uniform with your teeth.

76
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,940
<2-14,Bernadette>伯纳黛特
<2-14,Bernadette>Bernadette?!

77
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,510
<2-15,Howard>你在这儿干嘛
<2-15,Howard>What are you doing here?

78
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,340
<2-16,Katee Sackhoff>我猜的话  估计是
<2-16,Katee Sackhoff>Well, if I had to guess, I'd say I'm here

79
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,010
<2-16,Katee Sackhoff>因为你今晚见到我了
<2-16,Katee Sackhoff>because you saw me earlier this evening,

80
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,310
<2-16,Katee Sackhoff>而你还对我有留恋
<2-16,Katee Sackhoff>and you're still hung up on me.

81
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,690
<2-17,Howard>才没有呢
<2-17,Howard>No, I'm not.

82
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,360
<2-18,Bernadette>很明显有
<2-18,Bernadette>Clearly you are.

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,070
<2-18,Bernadette>否则根据以往经验
<2-18,Bernadette>Otherwise, based on past experience,

84
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,420
<2-18,Bernadette>我们现在都该完事儿了
<2-18,Bernadette>we'd be done by now.

85
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,640
<2-19,Howard>好吧  我现在有点混乱了
<2-19,Howard>Okay, I'm a little confused here.

86
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,480
<2-20,George Takei>亲爱的  我能帮什么吗
<2-20,George Takei>Oh, my. Can I help?

87
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,910
<2-21,Howard>又不是那方面的困惑
<2-21,Howard>Not that kind of confused.

88
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,550
<2-22,Bernadette>武井乔治在这儿干嘛
<2-22,Bernadette>What's George Takei doing here?

90
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,190
<2-23,Katee Sackhoff>霍华德  你有隐性的同性恋倾向吗
<2-23,Katee Sackhoff>Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?

91
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,910
<2-24,Howard>当然没有了
<2-24,Howard>No, of course not.

92
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,620
<2-25,George Takei>你是这么说了
<2-25,George Takei>So you say.

93
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,230
<2-25,George Takei>而我却站在这儿了
<2-25,George Takei>Yet, here I am.

94
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,350
<2-25,George Takei>乔治  我问你个问题
<2-25,George Takei>George, let me ask you something.

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,590
<2-26,Katee Sackhoff>作为科幻人物象征你是如何应对连续出演同类角色的
<2-26,Katee Sackhoff>How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?

96
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,700
<2-27,George Takei>是很难
<2-27,George Takei>It's difficult.

97
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,800
<2-27,George Takei>作为演员你想拓展戏路
<2-27,George Takei>You try and stretch as an actor--

98
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,690
<2-27,George Takei>尝试下斯特林堡  奥尼尔什么的
<2-27,George Takei>do Strindberg, O'Neill,

99
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,960
<2-27,George Takei>但他们想要的只是"航线已设定  船长"
<2-27,George Takei>but all they want is, "Course laid in, Captain."

100
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,200
<2-28,Katee Sackhoff>好好跟我说说
<2-28,Katee Sackhoff>Tell me about it.

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,440
<2-28,Katee Sackhoff>这太让我抓狂了
<2-28,Katee Sackhoff>It's frackin' frustrating.

102
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,840
<2-29,Howard>等等  凯蒂  你怎么走了
<2-29,Howard>Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?

103
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,020
<2-30,Bernadette>她走了是因为你内心深处想和我一起啊
<2-30,Bernadette>She's leaving because you really want to be with me.

104
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,880
<2-31,Mrs Wolowitz>霍华德  我找到我的束腹紧身裤了
<2-31,Mrs Wolowitz>Howard, I found my girdle!

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,060
<2-31,Mrs Wolowitz>原来在烘干机里
<2-31,Mrs Wolowitz>It was in the dryer!

106
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,220
<2-32,Howard>那太好了  妈妈
<2-32,Howard>Great, Ma!

107
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,700
<2-33,Mrs Wolowitz>我觉得它缩水了
<2-33,Mrs Wolowitz>I think it shrunk!

108
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,750
<2-33,Mrs Wolowitz>我的赘肉就跟面团宝宝似的
<2-33,Mrs Wolowitz>I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!

110
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,140
<2-34,Howard>一想到那个画面
<2-34,Howard>And with that mental picture,

111
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,940
<2-34,Howard>我想今晚的精神治疗到此为止了
<2-34,Howard>I think we're done for the evening.

112
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,800
<3-1,Leonard>你从没跟我说过你和伯纳黛特当初为何分手
<3-1,Leonard>You never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,390
<3-2,Howard>我做了件蠢事
<3-2,Howard>I did a stupid thing.

114
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,240
<3-3,Leonard>我猜也是
<3-3,Leonard>Yeah, I guessed that.

115
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,540
<3-4,Howard>像是那种现在难以面对她的蠢事
<3-4,Howard>It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.

116
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,640
<3-5,Leonard>你说的这范围广的可以从被窝里放屁
<3-5,Leonard>That covers anything from farting in bed

117
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,820
<3-5,Leonard>延伸到杀害流浪汉
<3-5,Leonard>to killing a homeless guy.

118
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,430
<3-5,Leonard>哦  我的天呐
<3-5,Leonard>Oh, my God.

119
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,670
<3-5,Leonard>你真碾死过流浪汉啊
<3-5,Leonard>You ran over a hobo.

120
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,580
<3-6,Howard>没有  别问了
<3-6,Howard>No. Stop asking.

121
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,700
<3-7,Leonard>好吧  你想跟她重归于好
<3-7,Leonard>All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her,

122
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,100
<3-7,Leonard>但却羞于面对她
<3-7,Leonard>but you're too ashamed to face her

123
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,470
<3-7,Leonard>就因为你曾经做了某件难以启齿的事
<3-7,Leonard>because of whatever it is you did.

124
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,760
<3-8,Howard>-差不多  -好吧
<3-8,Howard>- In a nutshell. - Okay.

125
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,680
<3-9,Leonard>那这么做你觉得怎样
<3-9,Leonard>Well, how about this?

126
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,440
<3-9,Leonard>你戴上诡异的面具从剧院里
<3-9,Leonard>Kidnap Bernadette from the opera

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,650
<3-9,Leonard>把伯纳黛特劫走  这样她就认不出你了
<3-9,Leonard>wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you.

129
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,030
<3-10,Howard>这么说吧  我不知道你是在跟我开玩笑还是怎么着
<3-10,Howard>Now, you see, I don't know if you're kidding or not.

130
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,220
<3-11,Raj>你开始蛮横无理了
<3-11,Raj>You're being unreasonable.

131
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,080
<3-11,Raj>为什么我就不能有张桌子
<3-11,Raj>Why can't I have a desk?!

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,380
<3-12,Sheldon>我们的合作研究是思维上的工作
<3-12,Sheldon>Our collaboration is a work of the mind.

133
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,200
<3-12,Sheldon>我们用不着桌子
<3-12,Sheldon>We don't need desks.

134
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,380
<3-13,Raj>但你有桌子啊
<3-13,Raj>You have a desk.

135
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,000
<3-15,Raj>-是的  -但我就不能有了是吧
<3-15,Raj>- Correct. - But I can't have one.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,740
<3-16,Sheldon>你说中要点了
<3-16,Sheldon>You're two for two.

137
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,070
<3-17,Leonard>为什么他不能有桌子  谢尔顿
<3-17,Leonard>Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?

138
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,700
<3-18,Sheldon>天呐  这一天怎么过不完了
<3-18,Sheldon>Oh, Lord, will this day never end?

139
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,900
<3-18,Sheldon>我已经再三向库萨帕里博士解释过了
<3-18,Sheldon>As I've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali,

140
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,750
<3-18,Sheldon>以他对美国俗语的理解能力  是不能明白
<3-18,Sheldon>whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him

141
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,070
<3-18,Sheldon>什么叫做时机妥当的
<3-18,Sheldon>when it's convenient.

142
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,960
<3-18,Sheldon>我的预算中绝没有添置额外办公家具的那份了
<3-18,Sheldon>There's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.

143
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,590
<3-19,Raj>那你就有预算来买一抽屉的红蜡糖
<3-19,Raj>Oh, but there's money for a drawer full of Red Vines,

144
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,380
<3-19,Raj>一把棉花糖步枪
<3-19,Raj>a marshmallow shooting rifle,

145
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,200
<3-19,Raj>以及带有夜光沙土的超级蚂蚁工坊[玩具]吗
<3-19,Raj>and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?

146
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,360
<3-20,Sheldon>是的
<3-20,Sheldon>Yes.

147
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,300
<3-21,Howard>好吧  那他出钱买自己的桌子呢
<3-21,Howard>Okay, what if he buys his own desk?

148
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,510
<3-22,Raj>是啊  要是我买我自己的桌子呢
<3-22,Raj>Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?

149
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,110
<3-23,Sheldon>-那太荒谬了  -为什么
<3-23,Sheldon>- That's ridiculous. - Why?

150
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,040
<3-25,Sheldon>因为...
<3-25,Sheldon>Because...

151
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,570
<3-26,Raj>请说
<3-26,Raj>Yes?

152
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,860
<3-27,Sheldon>这是我的办公室
<3-27,Sheldon>It's my office.

153
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,570
<3-29,Sheldon>-谢尔顿  -好了  好了
<3-29,Sheldon>- Sheldon. - All right, all right.

154
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,830
<3-29,Sheldon>他可以买他自己的桌子了
<3-29,Sheldon>He can buy his own desk.

155
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,360
<3-30,Raj>而且我可以放进你的办公室里
<3-30,Raj>And I can put it in your office?

156
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,170
<3-31,Sheldon>你还真的想得寸进尺了  是吧
<3-31,Sheldon>Well, you really want to dot the I's and cross the T's, don't you?

157
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,310
<3-32,Leonard>为何你要买带夜光沙土的蚂蚁工坊呢
<3-32,Leonard>Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?

158
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,840
<3-33,Sheldon>因为蚂蚁有些工作晚上做更出色
<3-33,Sheldon>They do some of their best work at night.

159
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,300
<4-1,Penny (picking up a top and sniffing it)>这个还能穿
<4-1,Penny (picking up a top and sniffing it)>Ah, it's okay.

160
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,680
<4-2,Sheldon (voice)>佩妮
<4-2,Sheldon (voice)>Penny?

161
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,510
<4-2,Sheldon (voice)>佩妮
<4-2,Sheldon (voice)>Penny?

162
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,620
<4-2,Sheldon (voice)>佩妮
<4-2,Sheldon (voice)>Penny?

163
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,110
<4-2,Sheldon (voice)>佩妮
<4-2,Sheldon (voice)>Penny?

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,370
<4-3,Howard>如果知道是我敲门你还会开吗
<4-3,Howard>Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?

165
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,130
<4-4,Penny>自从我发现
<4-4,Penny>Not since I found out

166
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,130
<4-4,Penny>你给我的泰迪熊安了摄像头之后就不会了
<4-4,Penny>the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.

167
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,510
<4-5,Howard>我只是有个问题想问
<4-5,Howard>I just have a question.

168
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,070
<4-5,Howard>伯纳黛特有跟你提起过我吗
<4-5,Howard>Does Bernadette ever talk about me?

169
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,080
<4-6,Penny>哦  当然有啊
<4-6,Penny>Oh, absolutely.

170
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,210
<4-7,Howard>-她提过吗  -当然
<4-7,Howard>- She does? - Yeah, sure.

171
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,340
<4-8,Penny>就在昨天  她还问我
<4-8,Penny>Just yesterday, she asked,

172
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,640
<4-8,Penny>为什么霍华德要躲在桌子底下
<4-8,Penny>"Why is Howard hiding under the table?"

173
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,180
<4-9,Howard>她看见了是吧
<4-9,Howard>She saw that, huh?

174
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,220
<4-10,Penny>没  没  一开始没有
<4-10,Penny>Oh, no, not at first.

175
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,500
<4-10,Penny>但在我告诉她后就...
<4-10,Penny>Right after I pointed it out.

176
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,890
<4-11,Howard>我问你点别的吧
<4-11,Howard>Let me ask you something else.

177
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,450
<4-11,Howard>她有跟谁交往吗
<4-11,Howard>Is she seeing anybody?

178
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,130
<4-12,Penny>据我所知没有吧
<4-12,Penny>Oh, not that I know of.

179
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,220
<4-12,Penny>既然说到了这个话题
<4-12,Penny>Hey, while we're on the subject,

180
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,880
<4-12,Penny>我想了解你们当初为何分手了
<4-12,Penny>why did you guys break up anyway?

181
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,900
<4-13,Howard>我觉得还是不说为好
<4-13,Howard>Oh, I'd rather not say.

182
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,160
<4-14,Penny>霍华德  你如果想得到我的帮助  就得让我知道
<4-14,Penny>Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.

183
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,600
<4-15,Howard>但说出来有些尴尬
<4-15,Howard>But it's embarrassing...

184
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,920
<4-16,Penny>是啊  我就期待着这个呢  进来吧
<4-16,Penny>Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.

185
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,910
<4-17,Howard>好吧  你听过魔兽世界吧
<4-17,Howard>Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?

186
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,740
<4-18,Penny>那个网络游戏吗  当然
<4-18,Penny>Um, the online game? Sure.

187
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
<4-19,Howard>那你可否知道
<4-19,Howard>Well, did you know

188
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,160
<4-19,Howard>游戏中的角色是可以互相发生性关系的
<4-19,Howard>that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?

189
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,630
<4-20,Penny>哦天呐  我想我有点头绪了
<4-20,Penny>Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.

190
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,060
<4-21,Howard>她叫巨魔葛林新蒂
<4-21,Howard>Her name was Glissinda the Troll.

191
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,600
<4-21,Howard>当伯纳黛特来找我的时候
<4-21,Howard>Bernadette walked in on me

192
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,230
<4-21,Howard>我们正在灵魂之桥下翻云覆雨呢
<4-21,Howard>while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.

193
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,050
<4-22,Penny>你说的没错  这是够糗的了
<4-22,Penny>Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.

194
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,140
<4-23,Howard>你能跟她说说吗
<4-23,Howard>Would you talk to her?

195
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,330
<4-24,Penny>伯纳黛特还是巨魔
<4-24,Penny>Bernadette or the troll?

196
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,780
<4-25,Howard>伯纳黛特  她太生我气了
<4-25,Howard>Bernadette. She was so mad at me,

197
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,920
<4-25,Howard>她甚至都没听我的解释
<4-25,Howard>she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story.

198
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,180
<4-26,Penny>那你的解释是什么
<4-26,Penny>Well, what was your side?

199
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,350
<4-27,Howard>那个巨魔葛林新蒂只是个虚拟的女人
<4-27,Howard>Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn't even a real woman.

200
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,750
<4-27,Howard>我是说  她也可能是个年届50在新泽西开卡车的人呢
<4-27,Howard>I mean, she could've been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.

201
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,270
<4-28,Penny>真的假的  那这么说没让她消消气吗
<4-28,Penny>Really? And that didn't make her feel better?

202
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,820
<4-29,Howard>你能帮我去问问看吗   看看我们还有没有
<4-29,Howard>Will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all

203
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,640
<4-29,Howard>重归于好的可能性了
<4-29,Howard>we could get back together?

204
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,850
<4-30,Penny>天  霍华德  我真不想趟你俩这趟浑水
<4-30,Penny>Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.

205
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,700
<4-30,Penny>别啊  你怎么忍心呢
<4-30,Penny>No. Why would you?

206
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,500
<4-31,Howard>我这个孤单的书呆子  和老妈相依为命
<4-31,Howard>I'm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother,

207
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,510
<4-31,Howard>努力寻求哪怕是一丝丝的幸福
<4-31,Howard>trying to find any scrap of happiness he can.

208
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,380
<4-31,Howard>也许是为了弥补
<4-31,Howard>You know, maybe to make up for

209
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,100
<4-31,Howard>11岁时父亲就离开他的缺憾吧
<4-31,Howard>the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.

210
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,830
<4-32,Penny>好吧  我会考虑的
<4-32,Penny>Okay, I will think about it.

211
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,440
<4-33,Howard>我一直在为父亲的出走
<4-33,Howard>You know, I've always blamed myself

212
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,870
<4-33,Howard>而深深自责
<4-33,Howard>for him leaving.

213
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,280
<4-33,Howard>我一直觉得那是因为他根本不想要我这个儿子
<4-33,Howard>I always thought it was because I wasn't the son he wanted.

214
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,480
<4-34,Penny>行了  我说了我会考虑的
<4-34,Penny>Yeah, I said I'd think about it.

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,120
<4-35,Howard>我体育不好  又有点病怏怏的
<4-35,Howard>I wasn't athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly...

216
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,380
<4-36,Penny>行了  好了  我在给她打电话了  看见没
<4-36,Penny>Okay, fine. Look, look, I'm calling her now! See?!

217
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,820
<4-37,Howard>谢谢
<4-37,Howard>Thank you.

218
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,350
<5-1,Leonard>总之  霍华德请佩妮帮忙牵线伯纳黛特
<5-1,Leonard>So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette,

219
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,990
<5-1,Leonard>然后她照办了
<5-1,Leonard>and she did,

220
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,630
<5-1,Leonard>接着伯纳黛特同意跟他见面  一起喝杯咖啡
<5-1,Leonard>and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.

221
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,190
<5-3,Leonard>-我有个问题  -问吧
<5-3,Leonard>- One question.  - Yeah?

222
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,670
<5-4,Sheldon>你干嘛跟我说这些
<5-4,Sheldon>Why on earth are you telling me all this?

223
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,780
<5-4,Sheldon>不知道
<5-4,Sheldon>I don't know.

224
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,410
<5-5,Leonard>有时候你的动作如此栩栩如生
<5-5,Leonard>Sometimes your movements are so lifelike,

225
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,060
<5-5,Leonard>我都忘了你其实不是人
<5-5,Leonard>I forget you're not a real boy.

226
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,740
<5-6,Raj>是你说我可以买张书桌的
<5-6,Raj>You said I could buy a desk.

227
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,290
<5-7,Sheldon>这东西压根不是书桌
<5-7,Sheldon>This isn't a desk.

228
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,510
<5-7,Sheldon>这是个...硕大无朋的怪物
<5-7,Sheldon>This is a... Brobdingnagian monstrosity.

229
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,960
<5-8,Raj>这是美国俗语里面对"巨大的书桌"的叫法吗
<5-8,Raj>Is that the American idiom for "Giant, big-ass desk"?

230
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,700
<5-9,Sheldon>其实是英式英语的说法
<5-9,Sheldon>It's actually British.

231
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,840
<5-10,Raj>能给我再说一遍吗
<5-10,Raj>Can you say it again for me?

232
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,640
<5-11,Sheldon>硕大无朋
<5-11,Sheldon>Brobdingnagian.

233
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,650
<5-12,Raj>再来一遍
<5-12,Raj>One more time?

234
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,670
<5-11,Sheldon>硕大无朋
<5-11,Sheldon>Brobdingnagian.

235
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,130
<5-14,Raj>来个三倍速的
<5-14,Raj>Now three times fast?

236
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,190
<5-15,Sheldon>硕大无朋  硕大无...

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,190
<5-17,Sheldon>很有意思的恶作剧
<5-17,Sheldon>A fine prank, very amusing.

<5-17,Sheldon>现在给我搬出去

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,040
<5-24,Raj>磨嘴皮子你休想赢我
<5-24,Raj>I can do this all day.

248
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,900
<5-25,Sheldon>好吧  既然你不搬
<5-25,Sheldon>All right, if you're not going to remove it,

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,410
<5-25,Sheldon>我来给你搬

255
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,880
<5-33,Sheldon>你怎么会想把这东西弄来这儿
<5-33,Sheldon>Why do you even want this here?

256
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,230
<5-33,Sheldon>它的大小与用途完全不成比例
<5-33,Sheldon>Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.

257
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,200
<5-34,Raj>要说它的用途就是让你不爽的话
<5-34,Raj>Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off,

258
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,580
<5-34,Raj>我看真是恰到好处
<5-34,Raj>I'd say it's spot-on.

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,230
<5-35,Sheldon>好了  我明白怎么回事了
<5-35,Sheldon>All right, I see what's going on.

261
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,220
<5-35,Sheldon>接下来就是一系列越演越烈的幼稚的针锋相对
<5-35,Sheldon>an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges.

262
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,440
<5-35,Sheldon>这个回合你赢了
<5-35,Sheldon>Well titted.

<6-1,Bernadette>抱歉  我得打卡下班
<6-1,Bernadette>Sorry, I had to clock out.

274
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,140
<6-4,Howard>结果发现我很怕海
<6-4,Howard>but it turns out I'm terrified of the ocean.

275
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,440
<6-5,Bernadette>太糟糕了
<6-5,Bernadette>Too bad.

306
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,260
<6-32,Howard>我承认  在互联网的某些黑暗肮脏的角落
<6-32,Howard>I'll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet

307
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,890
<6-32,Howard>确实有人在喃喃呼唤沃罗法师这个名字
<6-32,Howard>where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones.

308
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,260
<6-32,Howard>我去那些地方不过是因为
<6-32,Howard>The only reason I go there,

309
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,810
<6-32,Howard>我曾那样做的唯一原因
<6-32,Howard>the only reason I've ever gone there

310
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,780
<6-32,Howard>是因为我生命中一直没有真正的女友
<6-32,Howard>is because I don't have a real woman in my life.

<6-34,Bernadette>霍华德  你有过真正的女友
<6-34,Bernadette>Howard, you did have a real woman.

313
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,760
<6-34,Bernadette>我当时就在隔壁房间
<6-34,Bernadette>I was right there in the next room

314
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,000
<6-34,Bernadette>而你却疯狂地撸着鼠标跟巨魔进行剧烈运动
<6-34,Bernadette>while you were clicking that troll's brains out.

315
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,540
<6-35,Howard>对  但我们从未...
<6-35,Howard>Yeah, but we weren't...

<6-35,Howard>我是说  你我从未...
<6-35,Howard>I-I mean, you and I never...

317
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,580
<6-36,Bernadette>上过床
<6-36,Bernadette>Had sex?

318
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,300
<6-37,Howard>对
<6-37,Howard>Yeah.

319
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,490
<6-38,Bernadette>那又是谁的错呢
<6-38,Bernadette>Well, whose fault was that?

320
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,940
<6-39,Penny>免费赠送的墨西哥玉米片
<6-39,Penny>Complimentary nachos!

321
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,120
<6-39,Penny>慢慢享用
<6-39,Penny>You enjoy.

322
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,240
<6-39,Penny>从未上过床  哇
<6-39,Penny>Never had sex?

323
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,250
<6-40,Howard>你什么意思  问我那是谁的错
<6-40,Howard>What do you mean, whose fault was that?

324
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,630
<6-41,Bernadette>我们本可以上床的
<6-41,Bernadette>Well, we could've been having sex,

325
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,360
<6-41,Bernadette>但你从未主动采取行动
<6-41,Bernadette>but you never made the move.

326
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,650
<6-42,Howard>我以为是你不想我采取行动的
<6-42,Howard>I didn't think you wanted me to make the move.

327
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,380
<6-43,Bernadette>霍华德   女孩才不会跟你这样的人约会
<6-43,Bernadette>Howard, a girl doesn't go out with a man like you,

328
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,660
<6-43,Bernadette>就你那长相  说话那德性  还有那小紧身裤
<6-43,Bernadette>with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants

329
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,890
<6-43,Bernadette>除非她是想让你主动采取行动的
<6-43,Bernadette>if she's not expecting him to eventually make the move.

330
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,260
<6-44,Howard>真的吗
<6-44,Howard>Really?

331
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,820
<6-44,Howard>真的
<6-44,Howard>Really.

332
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,310
<6-46,Howard>妈的我早干嘛去了
<6-46,Howard>Son of a bitch.

333
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,180
<6-47,Penny>我真有点说不出口
<6-47,Penny>Hey, this is a little awkward,

334
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,140
<6-47,Penny>但经理说我无权免费赠送玉米片
<6-47,Penny>but my manager says I can't actually give nachos away.

335
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,290
<6-47,Penny>所以  谈好了记得买单啊
<6-47,Penny>So... just take that when you're ready.

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,930
<7-2,Leonard>那你跟那巨魔分了吗
<7-2,Leonard>Have you broken it to the troll yet?

340
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,400
<7-3,Howard>是佩妮告诉你的
<7-3,Howard>Did Penny tell you about that?

341
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,720
<7-4,Leonard>不是  史蒂夫·帕特森说的
<7-4,Leonard>No. Steve Patterson told me.

342
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,470
<7-5,Howard>设备管理部那恶心的老胖子
<7-5,Howard>The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?

343
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,110
<7-7,Howard>-对  -他怎么知道的
<7-7,Howard>- Yeah. - How'd he know about it?

344
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,980
<7-8,Leonard>他就是巨魔葛林新蒂
<7-8,Leonard>He's Glissinda the troll.

345
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,390
<7-9,Raj (voice)>抱歉兄弟  温度调节器在我这边
<7-9,Raj (voice)>Sorry, dude, the thermostat's on my side of the room,

346
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,080
<7-9,Raj (voice)>温度就定在跟孟买一样热
<7-9,Raj (voice)>so it stays Mumbai hot in here

347
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,500
<7-9,Raj (voice)>除非你关了那愚蠢的印度音乐
<7-9,Raj (voice)>until you turn off that stupid Indian music!

348
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,060
<7-10,Sheldon (voice)>我自然会关了音乐
<7-10,Sheldon (voice)>I'll turn off the music

349
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,640
<7-10,Sheldon (voice)>只要你处理掉那只携带着沙门氏菌的鹦鹉
<7-10,Sheldon (voice)>when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!

350
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,280
<7-11,Raj (voice)>太糟了  原来谢尔顿病态地怕鸟
<7-11,Raj (voice)>Oh, too bad! Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds!
