1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,130
<1-1,Leonard>我们用数学算过了
<1-1,Leonard>The math is all there.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,910
<1-2,Penny>-这不可能  -的确可能
<1-2,Penny>- It's not real. - Yes, it is.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,240
<1-3,Sheldon>好吧  听着
<1-3,Sheldon>Yeah... uh, look.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,240
<1-3,Sheldon>从科学角度上来说  单凭一人之力
<1-3,Sheldon>It is scientifically impossible

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,140
<1-3,Sheldon>Tip a cow over是指在牛站着睡觉的时候悄悄走到旁边
<1-3,Sheldon>将其推倒取乐的一种活动

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,140
<1-3,Sheldon>不可能从侧面将牛推倒
<1-3,Sheldon>for a person to tip a cow.

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,110
<1-3,Sheldon>就连你这个虎背熊腰的女汉子
<1-3,Sheldon>Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders,

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,500
<1-3,Sheldon>也不可能做到
<1-3,Sheldon>you couldn't do it.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,210
<1-4,Raj>太可怕了  你为什么要把牛推到
<1-4,Raj>It's horrible. Why would you push a cow over?

10
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,240
<1-6,Raj>它们多神圣啊
<1-6,Raj>They're sacred.

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,090
<1-5,Penny>少来了
<1-5,Penny>Oh, stop it.

13
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,200
<1-5,Penny>我都见你吃过不下一百万个牛肉汉堡了
<1-5,Penny>I've seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.

14
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,580
<1-6,Raj>动物可以集神圣和美味于一身
<1-6,Raj>Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.

15
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,670
<1-7,Penny>告诉你们  我的确把牛推倒过
<1-7,Penny>Look, I'm telling you I've done it, okay?

16
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,860
<1-7,Penny>我清楚地记得牛先是站着的
<1-7,Penny>I clearly remember the cow standing up

17
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,350
<1-7,Penny>然后就倒到一侧了
<1-7,Penny>and then the cow on its side.

18
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,270
<1-8,Leonard>你是不是喝醉了
<1-8,Leonard>Were you drunk?

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,460
<1-9,Penny>我当时是内布拉斯加州的16岁少女  你觉得呢
<1-9,Penny>I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?

20
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,490
<1-10,Leonard>我觉得你才是倒下的那个
<1-10,Leonard>I think you're the one who fell over.

21
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,430
<1-11,Penny>怪不得当时天空也也倒在一侧
<1-11,Penny>That would explain why the sky was also on its side.

22
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,110
<1-13,Penny>霍华德  "推牛倒"是真的还是假的
<1-13,Penny>Howard. Cow tipping: real or not?

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,620
<1-14,Howard>我觉得是  假的
<1-14,Howard>I'm gonna say... not.

24
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,900
<1-14,Howard>因为我曾试过在我妈打鼾时让她翻身
<1-14,Howard>That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over

25
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,730
<1-14,Howard>可死都推不动她
<1-14,Howard>when she's snoring.

26
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,480
<1-14,Howard>说到大块的肉
<1-14,Howard>Speaking of that big side of beef,

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,340
<1-14,Howard>她邀请你们去她家过感恩节
<1-14,Howard>uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.

28
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,010
<1-15,Sheldon>有人跟我说  赤裸裸地拒绝别人的邀请
<1-15,Sheldon>You know, I've been told that a bald refusal

29
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,650
<1-15,Sheldon>是很无礼的
<1-15,Sheldon>of an invitation is rude

30
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,070
<1-15,Sheldon>所以必须编造一个礼貌的借口来回绝
<1-15,Sheldon>and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so...

31
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,950
<1-18,Howard>我也很想去  但不幸的是
<1-18,Howard>I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,

32
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,700
<1-19,Sheldon>那听起来很可怕
<1-19,Sheldon>that sounds awful.

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,630
<1-16,Howard>去嘛  一点都不可怕
<1-16,Howard>Come on, it'll be fun.

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,270
<1-17,Penny>我们其实打算在这里过
<1-17,Penny>Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.

35
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,710
<1-18,Howard>拜托啦  伯纳黛特的妈妈不在家
<1-18,Howard>Please? Bernadette's bringing her dad

36
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,760
<1-18,Howard>所以她会带她爸来
<1-18,Howard>'cause her mom's out of town,

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,810
<1-18,Howard>可我跟他爸总是话不投机
<1-18,Howard>and I never have anything to say to that guy.

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,080
<1-19,Sheldon>既然你都这么说了  我也想帮你
<1-19,Sheldon>Oh, since you put it that way, I'd love to go,

39
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,200
<1-19,Sheldon>但那听起来更可怕了
<1-19,Sheldon>but that sounds even more awful.

40
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,450
<1-20,Leonard>其实不用一天都听
<1-20,Leonard>It'd actually be nice to not hear

41
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,480
<1-20,Leonard>谢尔顿抱怨我的厨艺挺好的
<1-20,Leonard>Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.

42
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,200
<1-21,Sheldon>什么  不好意思
<1-21,Sheldon>Yo... uh, excuse me,

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,720
<1-21,Sheldon>但每年你的菜都做得难吃
<1-21,Sheldon>but every year you prepare a terrible meal

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,750
<1-21,Sheldon>我每年都批评你的厨艺
<1-21,Sheldon>and every year I criticize it.

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,550
<1-21,Sheldon>难道我们的传统对你来说毫无意义吗
<1-21,Sheldon>Do our traditions mean nothing to you?

46
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,000
<1-22,Leonard>-我想去  -我也是
<1-22,Leonard>- I want to go. - Yeah, me, too.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,460
<1-25,Howard>-我也去  -谢尔顿
<1-25,Howard>- I'm in. - Sheldon.

48
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,030
<1-26,Sheldon>好吧  我去
<1-26,Sheldon>Ugh, fine, I'll go.

49
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,280
<1-26,Sheldon>但如果菜都很好吃  那感恩节就被毁了
<1-26,Sheldon>But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined,

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,690
<1-26,Sheldon>这笔账算你的
<1-26,Sheldon>and it's on you.

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,310
<1-26,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-26,Sheldon>第七季  第九集

55
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,770
<2-1,Sheldon>我们真的要去沃罗威茨夫人家吃饭吗
<2-1,Sheldon>Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

56
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,920
<2-2,Amy>是的
<2-2,Amy>We do.

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,460
<2-2,Amy>我希望你的行为举止要得当
<2-2,Amy>And I expect you to be on your best behavior.

58
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,230
<2-3,Sheldon>现在我了解非洲黑奴当时的感受了
<2-3,Sheldon>Now I know how the African slaves felt.

59
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,320
<2-3,Sheldon>被人强行从自己家园拖出
<2-3,Sheldon>Being dragged from their homes

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,120
<2-3,Sheldon>沦为受白人控制和使唤的劳力
<2-3,Sheldon>to labor under the yoke of the white man.

61
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,900
<2-4,Amy>你真的要把
<2-4,Amy>Are you honestly comparing

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,140
<2-4,Amy>去沃罗威茨妈妈家吃饭
<2-4,Amy>Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's

63
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,610
<2-4,Amy>和人类历史上最大的悲剧之一
<2-4,Amy>with one of the greatest tragedies

64
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,850
<2-4,Amy>这两件事相提并论吗
<2-4,Amy>in the history of mankind?

65
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,610
<2-5,Sheldon>是的
<2-5,Sheldon>Yes.

66
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,680
<2-6,Penny>谢尔顿  不管在哪里都可以过个开心的感恩节
<2-6,Penny>Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,230
<2-6,Penny>我就在维加斯试过
<2-6,Penny>I spent one in Vegas.

68
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,060
<2-7,Leonard>是吗
<2-7,Leonard>You did?

69
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,700
<2-8,Penny>对啊  当时我在跟扎克约会
<2-8,Penny>Yeah, back when I was dating Zack.

70
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,470
<2-8,Penny>那个感恩节比我想象中有趣多了
<2-8,Penny>It was actually more fun than I thought.

71
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,290
<2-8,Penny>我们先去赌博  然后去了一家低档的婚礼教堂
<2-8,Penny>We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels,

72
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,640
<2-8,Penny>我们还吃了一顿超美味的火鸡大餐
<2-8,Penny>we had a really good turkey dinner.

73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,200
<2-8,Penny>真的想不到这么好吃  因为我们是在脱衣舞俱乐部
<2-8,Penny>Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.

74
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,790
<2-9,Leonard>慢着  你们俩还去教堂了吗
<2-9,Leonard>Wait, you went to a chapel?

75
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,340
<2-11,Leonard>-是啊  -去干嘛
<2-11,Leonard>- Yeah. - Why?

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,810
<2-12,Penny>我们不过是办了一场假婚礼
<2-12,Penny>We had one of those silly fake weddings.

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,580
<2-12,Penny>拉斯维加斯办理结婚无需繁琐的手续
<2-12,Penny>只要新郎新娘两个人说"我愿意"就可以

78
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,870
<2-12,Penny>佩妮
<2-12,Penny>Penny...

79
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,610
<2-13,Leonard>你知道那是真结婚  对吧
<2-13,Leonard>you know those are real, right?

80
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,400
<2-14,Penny>不  是假结婚
<2-14,Penny>No, they're not.

81
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,290
<2-15,Leonard>是真的
<2-15,Leonard>Yeah, they are.

82
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,910
<2-14,Penny>是假的
<2-14,Penny>No, they're not.

83
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,830
<2-15,Leonard>是真的
<2-15,Leonard>Yeah, they are.

84
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,750
<2-19,Amy>-他说得对  -是真的
<2-19,Amy>- He's right. - They're real.

85
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,370
<2-20,Penny>但那看上去不像真的呀
<2-20,Penny>But it... didn't seem real.

86
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,080
<2-21,Sheldon>我问你个问题
<2-21,Sheldon>Let me ask you a question.

87
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,550
<2-21,Sheldon>有没可能  当时你眼中的拉斯维加斯是倒在一侧的呢
<2-21,Sheldon>At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?

88
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,490
<3-2,Mike>-爸爸  -乖宝贝
<3-2,Mike>- Hi, Dad. - Hi, honey.

89
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,940
<3-3,Bernadette>你还给大家买了啤酒啊
<3-3,Bernadette>Oh, you brought beer for everybody.

90
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,710
<3-4,Mike>好吧  没错  人人都有份
<3-4,Mike>Uh, okay, yeah, it's for everybody.

91
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,950
<3-4,Mike>我真是只想今天安静地在家待着
<3-4,Mike>I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home

92
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,330
<3-5,Bernadette>看看比赛
<3-5,Bernadette>and watch the game.

93
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,770
<3-5,Bernadette>你在这里也能安静待着看比赛啊
<3-5,Bernadette>You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.

94
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,530
<3-6,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>霍华德  那药不管用
<3-6,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Howard, the medicine's not working!

95
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,330
<3-7,Howard (off)>你刚吃了没多久
<3-7,Howard (off)>You just took it.

96
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,530
<3-7,Howard (off)>至少等它先到达你第一个胃再说
<3-7,Howard (off)>At least let it reach your first stomach!

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,530
<3-7,Howard (off)>迈克  来了啊
<3-7,Howard (off)>Hey, Mike.

98
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,680
<3-7,Howard (off)>-我来帮你拿吧  -谢谢
<3-7,Howard (off)>- Let me help you out, there. - Thanks.

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,080
<3-8,Mike>你妈妈怎么了
<3-8,Mike>What's wrong with your mom?

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,430
<3-9,Howard>她的痛风加重了
<3-9,Howard>Oh, her gout's flaring up.

101
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,870
<3-9,Howard>看来一天一个苹果派
<3-9,Howard>Turns out an apple pie a day

102
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,840
<3-9,Howard>并不能让你远离疾病
<3-9,Howard>does not keep the doctor away.

103
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,370
<3-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>为什么我的小脚趾这么疼呢
<3-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>How can one little toe hurt so bad?

104
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,130
<3-11,Howard>或许是因为那只小脚趾
<3-11,Howard>Maybe because that little piggy

105
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,560
<3-11,Howard>被你的庞大的身躯压碎了
<3-11,Howard>is being crushed by the barn!

106
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,620
<3-11,Howard>她很快就会安静下来
<3-11,Howard>She should quiet down soon.

107
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,440
<3-11,Howard>我给她的止痛药足以让一头...
<3-11,Howard>I gave her enough pain meds to choke a...

108
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,160
<3-11,Howard>让她安静下来
<3-11,Howard>well, her.

109
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,360
<3-12,Bernadette>我们得开始做饭了
<3-12,Bernadette>I guess we're gonna have to do all the cooking.

110
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,300
<3-13,Howard>我有个更好的主意
<3-13,Howard>I have a better idea.

111
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,410
<3-14,Bernadette>如果你想让我一个人干所有的活
<3-14,Bernadette>If you think you're gonna make me do all this by myself,

112
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,310
<3-14,Bernadette>那绝对不行
<3-14,Bernadette>you're crazy.

113
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,960
<3-15,Howard>我是想让拉杰一个人干所有的活
<3-15,Howard>I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.

114
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,890
<3-16,Bernadette>那真是个好主意
<3-16,Bernadette>Oh, well, that's a great idea.

115
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,950
<4-1,Amy>路上没车  真是一帆风顺啊
<4-1,Amy>No traffic, we're sailing.

116
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,720
<4-1,Amy>是啊
<4-1,Amy>Yes.

117
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,670
<4-2,Sheldon>好像我们在船上一样
<4-2,Sheldon>Like we're on a ship.

118
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,540
<4-2,Sheldon>一艘从非洲到美国的船
<4-2,Sheldon>Coming from Africa to America.

119
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,030
<4-3,Amy>谢尔顿  这样做太不恰当了
<4-3,Amy>Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate.

120
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,390
<4-3,Amy>你不能一直将自己比作奴隶
<4-3,Amy>You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.

121
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,950
<4-4,Sheldon>是的  艾米小姐
<4-4,Sheldon>Yes, Miss Amy.

122
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,340
<4-5,Leonard>真不敢相信你居然跟那个傻蛋结婚了
<4-5,Leonard>I can't believe you're married to that idiot.

123
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,490
<4-6,Penny>别说了行吗  我们只是闹着玩的
<4-6,Penny>Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.

124
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,140
<4-7,Leonard>不管是不是闹着玩  你们都是真结婚了
<4-7,Leonard>Well, a goof or not, you're actually married.

125
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,100
<4-7,Leonard>-你得解决这件事  -我会的
<4-7,Leonard>- You need to get this taken care of. - I will.

126
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,400
<4-8,Penny>你干嘛在这件事上小题大作
<4-8,Penny>Why are you making this such a big deal?

127
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,890
<4-9,Sheldon>我知道原因
<4-9,Sheldon>Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason.

128
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,000
<4-9,Sheldon>可能是因为你愿意嫁给扎克
<4-9,Sheldon>It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack,

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,560
<4-9,Sheldon>而每次莱纳德向你求婚时
<4-9,Sheldon>but every time Leonard's proposed,

130
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,740
<4-9,Sheldon>你总是拒绝他
<4-9,Sheldon>he's gotten a resounding no.

131
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,540
<4-9,Sheldon>我一下子就想到这个答案了
<4-9,Sheldon>Yeah, that's just off the top of my head.

132
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,220
<4-10,Penny>那我该怎么办
<4-10,Penny>So how do I undo this?

133
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,800
<4-11,Leonard>我希望你能解除婚约
<4-11,Leonard>I'm hoping you can get an annulment.

134
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,190
<4-11,Leonard>就好像这事从来没发生过
<4-11,Leonard>It's just like it never happened.

135
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,820
<4-12,Penny>好啊  那我应该怎么做
<4-12,Penny>Great, well, what do I have to do?

136
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,360
<4-13,Amy>从法律上说  解除婚约
<4-13,Amy>It says here you can get an annulment

137
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,300
<4-13,Amy>必须满足一下任何一个条件
<4-13,Amy>if any of the following conditions are met.

138
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,660
<4-13,Amy>"婚后  两人从未圆房"
<4-13,Amy>"Were you unable to consummate the marriage?"

139
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,790
<4-14,Sheldon>佩妮是欲女  下一条
<4-14,Sheldon>Penny? Next.

140
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,800
<4-15,Amy>"两人间存在欺骗  重婚
<4-15,Amy>"Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy,

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,480
<4-16,Penny>缺乏谅解"
<4-16,Penny>want of understanding?"

142
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
<4-16,Penny>到底什么是"缺乏谅解[理解力]"
<4-16,Penny>"Want of understanding?" What does that even mean?

143
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,960
<4-17,Amy>叮叮叮  说的就是你
<4-17,Amy>Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,380
<5-1,Bernadette>谢谢你救我于水火之中
<5-1,Bernadette>Thanks for saving the day.

145
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,400
<5-2,Raj>不用谢
<5-2,Raj>Ah, no problem.

146
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,160
<5-2,Raj>美国的第一个感恩节是印第安人与新移民第一次齐聚感谢上天赐予
<5-2,Raj>并感谢印第安人曾在危急的时刻送来食物和帮助他们

147
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,450
<5-2,Raj>没有印第安人[印度人]献上美食
<5-2,Raj>It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

148
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,160
<5-2,Raj>就不算是真正的感恩节
<5-2,Raj>without an Indian providing the food.

149
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,900
<5-2,Raj>你妈妈把植物奶油放哪里了
<5-2,Raj>Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?

150
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,730
<5-3,Howard>我不知道
<5-3,Howard>Um, I don't know.

151
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,880
<5-3,Howard>大概是塞在她脸颊的肥肉里了
<5-3,Howard>Probably in a wad in her cheek.

152
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,320
<5-4,Bernadette>我在这里帮拉杰
<5-4,Bernadette>I'll help Raj in here.

153
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,070
<5-4,Bernadette>你出去陪我爸爸好吗
<5-4,Bernadette>Why don't you go keep my dad company?

154
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,290
<5-5,Howard>他可不想我陪他
<5-5,Howard>Oh, he doesn't want me in there.

155
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,530
<5-5,Howard>我在他眼中是  睡了他乖女儿的讨厌鬼
<5-5,Howard>I'm the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.

156
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,770
<5-6,Bernadette>-别傻了  他喜欢你  -真的吗
<5-6,Bernadette>- Don't be silly, he loves you. - Does he?

157
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,230
<5-8,Bernadette>-好吧  至少他关心你啊  -真的吗
<5-8,Bernadette>- Okay, he cares about you a lot. - Really?

158
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,520
<6-1,Bernadette>老娘不也经常为你做牛做马  快滚出去
<6-1,Bernadette>I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.

159
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,330
<6-2,Howard>你太太和孙子们一起待在亚利桑那吗
<6-2,Howard>So your wife's in Arizona with the grandkids?

160
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,800
<6-4,Howard>我妈妈也去过亚利桑那州
<6-4,Howard>You know, my mom's been to...Arizona.

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,980
<6-4,Howard>她骑着一头骡子穿越大峡谷
<6-4,Howard>She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon.

162
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,250
<6-4,Howard>最后为了让骡子落个安乐死  人们把它射死了
<6-4,Howard>Long story short, they had to shoot it.

163
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,170
<6-4,Howard>因为我妈实在太胖了
<6-4,Howard>'Cause she's so fat.

164
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,090
<6-4,Howard>您慢慢笑  我去开门
<6-4,Howard>I'll get the door while you finish laughing.

165
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,220
<6-4,Howard>大家好
<6-4,Howard>Hey, guys.

166
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,430
<6-5,Amy>感恩节快乐
<6-5,Amy>Happy Thanksgiving.

167
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,040
<6-6,Sheldon>闻起来真香啊
<6-6,Sheldon>It smells wonderful.

168
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,350
<6-6,Sheldon>是谁在厨房做苦力
<6-6,Sheldon>Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen?

169
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,790
<6-6,Sheldon>-因为我也...  -谢尔顿
<6-6,Sheldon>- Because I, too, know... - Sheldon.

170
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,550
<6-8,Penny>给你  谢谢你邀请我们
<6-8,Penny>Here. Thank you for having us.

171
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,840
<6-10,Leonard>-你怎么了  -她在生我的气
<6-10,Leonard>- What's with you? - Oh, she's mad at me

172
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,700
<6-10,Leonard>因为她刚发现她和扎克结婚了
<6-10,Leonard>because she just found out she's married to Zack.

173
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,470
<6-10,Leonard>真的吗
<6-10,Leonard>Really?

174
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,550
<6-11,Howard>那个和她约会过的傻蛋吗
<6-11,Howard>That dumb-ass she used to date?

175
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,740
<6-11,Howard>这也太搞笑了
<6-11,Howard>That's hysterical.

176
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,730
<6-12,Penny>亏我还为在车里打开了这酒而自责
<6-12,Penny>I can't believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.

177
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,820
<7-1,Amy>-你俩要帮忙吗  -好呀
<7-1,Amy>- You need any help? - Uh, yeah,

178
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,040
<7-2,Raj>你能拿一下上面的酱汁碗吗
<7-2,Raj>can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?

179
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,510
<7-3,Amy>-没问题  -太好了
<7-3,Amy>- Uh, sure. - Great.

180
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,380
<7-4,Raj>至少你俩还有人能够得着
<7-4,Raj>That makes one of you.

181
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,490
<7-4,Raj>我们任务重大  时间却很紧迫
<7-4,Raj>Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it.

182
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,930
<7-4,Raj>伯纳黛特  你负责玉米  肉酱汁和红薯
<7-4,Raj>Bernadette, you're on corn, gravy and yam detail.

183
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,470
<7-4,Raj>艾米  你负责面包卷  蔓越莓
<7-4,Raj>Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries

184
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,200
<7-4,Raj>并且确保不让伯纳黛特靠近棉花糖
<7-4,Raj>and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows.

185
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,050
<7-4,Raj>没错  我看见你偷吃了
<7-4,Raj>That's right, I see you.

186
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,830
<7-4,Raj>如果有问题要问
<7-4,Raj>Okay, if you have any questions,

187
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,630
<7-4,Raj>我就在这里  专心地给烤肉刷油
<7-4,Raj>I'll be over here basting my ass off.

188
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,700
<7-4,Raj>集中注意力是关键
<7-4,Raj>Focus is key.

189
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,020
<7-5,Amy>你们知道佩妮和扎克三年前就结婚了吗
<7-5,Amy>Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?

190
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,770
<7-6,Together>-什么  -啥
<7-6,Together>- What? - Wha...?

191
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,870
<8-1,Howard>你打过橄榄球吗
<8-1,Howard>You ever play football?

192
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,630
<8-2,Mike>大学时玩过一点
<8-2,Mike>A little in college.

193
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,250
<8-2,Mike>-你呢  -没玩过
<8-2,Mike>- You? - No.

194
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,310
<8-3,Howard>不过我曾经作为球  被人在走廊阻截过一次
<8-3,Howard>But I did get tackled in the hallway once.

195
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,220
<8-3,Howard>整个学校欢声雷动啊
<8-3,Howard>The whole school cheered.

196
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,540
<8-4,Leonard>我找到了你和扎克
<8-4,Leonard>Hey, I found the, uh, court papers

197
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,640
<8-4,Leonard>需要填写的法庭文件
<8-4,Leonard>that you and Zack need to fill out.

198
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,400
<8-4,Leonard>-等我回家就打印出来  -行
<8-4,Leonard>- I'll print them when we get home. - Fine.

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,430
<8-6,Leonard>然后我们就可以彻底忘掉这事了
<8-6,Leonard>And we can just put this whole thing behind us.

200
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,070
<8-7,Penny>-你有完没完  -怎么了
<8-7,Penny>- Are you done? - What?

201
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,280
<8-9,Penny>我知道  我做错了
<8-9,Penny>Look, I get it, I screwed up.

202
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,820
<8-9,Penny>难道今天剩下的时间  你都要提起这件事吗
<8-9,Penny>Is this all we're gonna talk about the rest of the day?

203
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,020
<8-10,Leonard>你对我凶什么呀
<8-10,Leonard>Why are you mad at me?

204
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,180
<8-10,Leonard>明明是你做了蠢事
<8-10,Leonard>You're the one that did the stupid thing.

205
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,320
<8-10,Leonard>而我只是帮你解决而已
<8-10,Leonard>I'm just trying to fix it.

206
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,070
<8-11,Penny>我需要呼吸点新鲜空气
<8-11,Penny>I need some air.

207
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,960
<8-12,Leonard>那个...佩妮
<8-12,Leonard>Well... Penny.

208
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,130
<8-13,Sheldon>我虽然完全不了解女人
<8-13,Sheldon>Now, I don't know the first thing about women,

209
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,220
<8-13,Sheldon>但我要是你  我就不会跟出去
<8-13,Sheldon>but I would not follow her.

210
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,700
<8-14,Mike>听瘦高个的话没错
<8-14,Mike>Listen to Stretch.

211
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,900
<8-15,Leonard>怎么成了我的错了
<8-15,Leonard>How am I the bad guy?

212
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,680
<8-15,Leonard>是她乱嫁人  我是受害者好吗
<8-15,Leonard>She's the one who married someone else. I'm the victim.

213
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,860
<8-16,Howard>扎克才是受害者吧
<8-16,Howard>Sounds like Zack's the victim.

214
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,620
<8-16,Howard>你睡了人家老婆
<8-16,Howard>You're sleeping with his wife.

215
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,490
<8-17,Mike>我的婚姻35年来一直幸福和睦
<8-17,Mike>I've kept my marriage together for 35 years.

216
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,130
<8-17,Mike>我能给点建议吗
<8-17,Mike>Can I weigh in here?

217
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,050
<8-18,Leonard>好呀
<8-18,Leonard>Sure.

218
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,470
<8-19,Mike>我正在看比赛呢  闭嘴
<8-19,Mike>I'm trying to watch the game. Shut up.

219
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,040
<8-19,Mike>怎么会错过第一次进攻呢
<8-19,Mike>How do you not make a first down there?

220
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,070
<8-20,Sheldon>人家用了五个后卫  他们还敢传球
<8-20,Sheldon>They passed against a nickel defense.

221
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,950
<8-20,Sheldon>应该采取摆脱拦截才对
<8-20,Sheldon>They should have run it off-tackle.

222
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,410
<8-21,Mike>你怎么会看球
<8-21,Mike>How the hell do you know that?

223
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,090
<8-22,Sheldon>我爸爱死橄榄球了
<8-22,Sheldon>My father loved football.

224
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,390
<8-22,Sheldon>他总是强迫我一起看
<8-22,Sheldon>He always made me watch it

225
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,910
<8-22,Sheldon>不看完不准做作业
<8-22,Sheldon>before I was allowed to do my homework.

226
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,920
<8-23,Penny>你高兴了吧  我刚打电话给扎克了
<8-23,Penny>Well, you'll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack

227
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,630
<8-23,Penny>他会签那些文件的
<8-23,Penny>and he's willing to sign the court papers.

228
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,980
<8-23,Penny>他马上就过来
<8-23,Penny>He's on his way here now.

229
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,620
<8-24,Leonard>-等等  你居然让他来这  -是呀
<8-24,Leonard>- Wait, you invited him here? - Yeah.

230
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,530
<8-26,Mike>我准备再次发表建议了
<8-26,Mike>I'm getting ready to weigh in again.

231
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,110
<8-27,Leonard>过来
<8-27,Leonard>Come on.

232
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,770
<8-28,Mike>你觉得他们现在应该怎么做
<8-28,Mike>What do you think they ought to do now?

233
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,010
<8-29,Sheldon>我会快速斜向往球场内出发  扔球给外接手
<8-29,Sheldon>I would throw a quick slant to a wideout,

234
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,090
<8-29,Sheldon>因为防守线卫似乎要向传球员突袭了
<8-29,Sheldon>given that the defense is showing blitz.

235
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,650
<8-30,Howard>我最喜欢薄饼卷了
<8-30,Howard>Oh, I love a good blitz,

236
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,960
<8-30,Howard>尤其是加酸奶油的那种
<8-30,Howard>especially with sour cream.

237
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,250
<8-30,Howard>懂我笑点吗
<8-30,Howard>Get it?

238
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,760
<8-30,Howard>因为这两者音很近啊
<8-30,Howard>'Cause it sounds like "Blintz."

239
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,550
<8-31,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>刚有人说"薄饼卷"吗
<8-31,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Did someone say "Blintz"?!

240
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,570
<9-1,Leonard>我不明白你为什么非得今天把他叫来
<9-1,Leonard>I just don't understand why you invited him here today.

241
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,290
<9-2,Penny>因为你唠叨个没完
<9-2,Penny>Because you wouldn't shut up about it.

242
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,580
<9-2,Penny>我打给他时  他反正也没事干
<9-2,Penny>When I called him, he had nothing to do,

243
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,570
<9-2,Penny>所以我就想...
<9-2,Penny>so I just thought it would...

244
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,150
<9-3,Raj>两位  我在里面做饭呢
<9-3,Raj>Hey, guys, I'm trying to cook in here.

245
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,360
<9-4,Penny>抱歉  我们会小点声的
<9-4,Penny>Oh, sorry. We'll keep it down.

246
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,790
<9-5,Raj>不  大声点
<9-5,Raj>No, no, speak up.

247
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,420
<9-5,Raj>我要用搅拌器了
<9-5,Raj>I'm about to use the blender,

248
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,130
<9-5,Raj>可我一句也不想漏掉
<9-5,Raj>and I don't want to miss anything.

249
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
<9-6,Leonard>你要多准备一人份的食物了
<9-6,Leonard>Well, you might have to cook for one more

250
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
<9-6,Leonard>因为她邀请了扎克过来
<9-6,Leonard>because she invited Zack.

251
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,440
<9-8,Amy>-什么  -哇哦
<9-8,Amy>- What? - Ooh!

252
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,170
<9-9,Raj>我的天
<9-9,Raj>My, my.

253
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,930
<9-9,Raj>故事发展如同我的肉汁  越加复杂[浓厚]了
<9-9,Raj>The plot, like my gravy, thickens.

254
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,910
<10-1,Sheldon>我不喜欢你妈的卫生间
<10-1,Sheldon>I don't care for your mother's bathroom.

255
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,730
<10-1,Sheldon>不管你面朝哪边尿尿
<10-1,Sheldon>There's not an angle to do one's business

256
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,570
<10-1,Sheldon>都有一个小丑雕像瞪着你
<10-1,Sheldon>without a clown figurine staring at you.

257
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,330
<10-2,Howard>所以我才坐着尿
<10-2,Howard>That's why I sit.

258
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,160
<10-3,Mike>没错  所以你才不爷们
<10-3,Mike>Yeah, that's why.

259
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,210
<10-3,Mike>你还记得达拉斯下大雪的
<10-3,Mike>You remember the Thanksgiving game

260
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,200
<10-3,Mike>那次感恩节比赛吗
<10-3,Mike>when it snowed in Dallas?

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,650
<10-4,Sheldon>1993年
<10-4,Sheldon>1993--

262
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,700
<10-4,Sheldon>里昂·莱特在最后几秒犯了错
<10-4,Sheldon>Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds

263
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,740
<10-4,Sheldon>海豚队取得了胜利
<10-4,Sheldon>and the Dolphins emerged victorious.

264
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,970
<10-4,Sheldon>于是我终于能做我的微积分题了
<10-4,Sheldon>Then I finally got to do my calculus.

265
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,110
<10-5,Mike>我当时气疯了  差点没一枪崩了电视
<10-5,Mike>I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.

266
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,630
<10-6,Sheldon>我爸也是
<10-6,Sheldon>So was my dad.

267
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,310
<10-6,Sheldon>他真的开了枪
<10-6,Sheldon>And then he did.

268
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,390
<10-7,Howard>-有人还要啤酒吗  -我要
<10-7,Howard>- Anyone need a beer?-  Yeah.

269
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,410
<10-9,Howard>谢天谢地
<10-9,Howard>Thank God.

270
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,550
<10-10,Mike>你爸爸还住在德克萨斯吗
<10-10,Mike>So, does your dad still live in Texas?

271
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,600
<10-11,Sheldon>不  我十四岁时他就死了
<10-11,Sheldon>No. He died when I was 14.

272
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,000
<10-12,Mike>真是太遗憾了
<10-12,Mike>I'm sorry to hear that.

273
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,680
<10-13,Sheldon>本地酒店的老板也很遗憾
<10-13,Sheldon>So was the man who owned the local liquor store.

274
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,850
<10-13,Sheldon>他泣不成声  痛哭流涕
<10-13,Sheldon>He cried and cried.

275
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,110
<10-14,Howard>啤酒来了
<10-14,Howard>Here you go.

276
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,700
<10-15,Mike>谢谢
<10-15,Mike>Oh, thanks.

277
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,990
<10-15,Mike>既然你爸在你十四岁就过世了
<10-15,Mike>So, if your dad died when you were 14,

278
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,080
<10-15,Mike>你肯定没机会和他一起喝啤酒吧
<10-15,Mike>you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.

279
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,320
<10-16,Sheldon>是的  先生
<10-16,Sheldon>No, sir.

280
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,060
<10-16,Sheldon>我高中毕业时他想跟我喝一罐
<10-16,Sheldon>He did try to give me one for my high school graduation,

281
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,040
<10-16,Sheldon>但我才11岁  我妈妈说不行
<10-16,Sheldon>but I was 11 and my mom said no.

282
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,150
<10-17,Mike>那你就跟我喝一罐吧
<10-17,Mike>Well, you're having one with me.

283
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,210
<10-18,Sheldon>好的
<10-18,Sheldon>All right.

284
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,060
<10-19,Mike>敬你的父亲
<10-19,Mike>To your dad.

285
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,050
<10-20,Howard>我也从来没和我爸喝过啤酒
<10-20,Howard>I never had a beer with my dad, either.

286
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,300
<10-21,Sheldon>能别插嘴吗  我们喝得正欢呢
<10-21,Sheldon>Do you mind? We're having a moment here.

287
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,290
<11-1,Amy>真不敢相信佩妮嫁给了扎克
<11-1,Amy>I can't believe Penny's married to Zack.

288
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,350
<11-2,Raj>不知道她看上他哪一点
<11-2,Raj>Wonder what she saw in that guy.

289
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,100
<11-2,Raj>不知道
<11-2,Raj>I don't know.

290
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,680
<11-3,Bernadette>他可爱  高大  英俊
<11-3,Bernadette>He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

291
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,540
<11-4,Amy>他有宽阔的肩膀  浓密的头发
<11-4,Amy>Broad shoulders, good hair.

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,850
<11-5,Raj>不知道她看上莱纳德哪一点
<11-5,Raj>Wonder what she sees in Leonard.

293
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,980
<11-6,Bernadette>外面情况如何
<11-6,Bernadette>How's it going out there?

294
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,910
<11-7,Howard>谢尔顿和你爸把酒言欢
<11-7,Howard>Sheldon and your dad are bonding

295
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,750
<11-7,Howard>完全无视我的存在
<11-7,Howard>and completely ignoring me.

296
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,330
<11-8,Amy>我知道你的感受
<11-8,Amy>I know how you feel.

297
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,940
<11-8,Amy>他买了智能吸尘器后  无视了我一周
<11-8,Amy>Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum.

298
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,120
<11-8,Amy>趁他不注意的时候  我踢了那玩意一脚
<11-8,Amy>I kick it when he's not looking.

299
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,680
<11-9,Bernadette>他们在做什么
<11-9,Bernadette>What are they doing?

<11-10,Howard>喝啤酒  看橄榄球比赛
<11-10,Howard>They're drinking beer and watching football.

301
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,850
<11-11,Bernadette>你就和他们一起呗
<11-11,Bernadette>So why don't do that with them.

302
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,400
<11-12,Howard>他们不要我
<11-12,Howard>They don't want me.

303
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,340
<11-13,Bernadette>什么意思
<11-13,Bernadette>What do you mean?

304
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,940
<11-14,Howard>谢尔顿开始诉说他的父亲已经不在人世了
<11-14,Howard>Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn't alive anymore,

305
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,800
<11-14,Howard>在他们碰杯时  我试图告诉他们
<11-14,Howard>and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about

306
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,920
<11-14,Howard>我父亲抛弃我们时  我有多难过
<11-14,Howard>how sad I was when my dad abandoned...

<12-10,Penny>我们没有孩子

<12-12,Penny>主婚人是山寨猫王

<12-20,Zack>我不想我老婆跟你这种人约会

<13-1,Sheldon (burping)>3. 14159 26535 89793 23846

357
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,800
<13-1,Sheldon (burping)>再说就要吐了
<13-1,Sheldon (burping)>That's all I can do without throwing up.

358
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,710
<13-2,Mike>我可没料到
<13-2,Mike>That is not what I expected

359
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,560
<13-2,Mike>你说打嗝说出π[馅饼]是这个意思
<13-2,Mike>when you said you were gonna burp "Pie."

360
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,100
<13-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>刚有人说"馅饼"吗
<13-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Did somebody say "Pie"?!

361
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,560
<13-4,Mike>我不知道哪种更吓人
<13-4,Mike>I don't know what's scarier:

362
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,980
<13-4,Mike>厕所小丑
<13-4,Mike>the bathroom clowns

363
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,970
<13-4,Mike>还是把小丑放进去的女人
<13-4,Mike>or the woman that put them there.

364
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,940
<13-5,Sheldon>我只知道  车上只能放下一个她
<13-5,Sheldon>All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car.

365
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,610
<13-5,Sheldon>那是从她身体里蹦出来的小丑
<13-5,Sheldon>And there's the clown that came out of her.

366
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,830
<13-5,Sheldon>我之前真的不想来
<13-5,Sheldon>I really didn't want to come here,

367
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,350
<13-5,Sheldon>但看来这次感恩节
<13-5,Sheldon>but this is shaping up to be

00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,190
<13-10,Sheldon>我摄入了酒精  导致我行为不当
<13-10,Sheldon>I've had alcohol, and it's caused me to be inappropriate.
