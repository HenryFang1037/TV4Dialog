<1-2,Leonard>好吧
<1-2,Leonard>Okay.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,320
<1-3,Penny>既然你们都阻止不了我来蹭吃的
<1-3,Penny>If you can't get me to stop eating your food,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,070
<1-3,Penny>你凭什么觉得能阻止我蹭无线网呢
<1-3,Penny>what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,620
<1-4,Sheldon>我相信你还是会浪子回头的
<1-4,Sheldon>I believe that you're capable of great change.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,030
<1-4,Sheldon>就像我当初终于让你不再说"情伦节"一样
<1-4,Sheldon>Like when I finally got you to stop saying "Valentimes Day""

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,950
<1-5,Leonard>有件很诡异的事儿想听吗

<1-9,Sheldon>你问佩妮想不想听一些奇怪的事情啊
<1-9,Sheldon>You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,770
<1-10,Leonard>没错  因为我有件很诡异的事情要跟她讲
<1-10,Leonard>Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,230
<1-11,Sheldon>我还以为这是个游戏呢
<1-11,Sheldon>I thought it was a game.

<1-13,Leonard>他就在本市  想找我喝两杯
<1-13,Leonard>He's in town and wants to have drinks.

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,820
<1-14,Sheldon>佩妮  如果这是个游戏  你有如下选择
<1-14,Sheldon>Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices.

<1-17,Sheldon>And that's how it's done.

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,000
<1-18,Penny>那个欺负你的家伙你打算怎么办
<1-18,Penny>What are you gonna do about your bully?

36
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,840
<1-22,Sheldon>是不是这个家伙当初提你内裤太过用力
<1-22,Sheldon>Was he the one who wedgied you so hard,

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,260

00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,470
<1-26,Sheldon>他是不是那个让你吃自己手毛的家伙
<1-26,Sheldon>Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,790
<1-27,Leonard>不是  不过其实
<1-27,Leonard>No, but, actually,

<1-32,Penny>唉  真可惜  本来可以

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,690
<2-8,Sheldon>我又没有时刻盯着你
<2-8,Sheldon>I don't watch you 24 hours a day.

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,600
<2-8,Sheldon>谁知道你都干了些啥呢
<2-8,Sheldon>I don't know what you do.

82
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,130
<2-9,Leonard>还不是因为吉米·斯贝克曼的事儿
<2-9,Leonard>It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing.

83
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,880
<2-9,Leonard>我犹豫到底要不要去见他
<2-9,Leonard>I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not.

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,100
<2-9,Leonard>当然也许是
<2-9,Leonard>Of course that might be

85
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,480
<2-9,Leonard>因为我上次碰到他的时候
<2-9,Leonard>because the last time I ran into him,

86
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,700
<2-9,Leonard>他强迫我拿鞋带当牙线用
<2-9,Leonard>he made me floss with my own shoelaces.

<2-10,Sheldon>怕人偷还是怕人抢啊
<2-10,Sheldon>You afraid someone's going to steal it?

93
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,520
<2-10,Sheldon>就像你偷了爱因斯坦的宇宙常数一样一样对吧
<2-10,Sheldon>Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?

94
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,680
<2-10,Sheldon>你知道吗

<2-11,Leonard>该在高中时告诉他的话都说出来
<2-11,Leonard>all the things I should have said in high school.

98
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,800
<2-11,Leonard>比如  "找个跟你块头差不多欺负看看"
<2-11,Leonard>You know, "Pick on someone your own size"

<3-1,Bernadette>我好喜欢这条裙子
<3-1,Bernadette>I love this dress.

105
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,500
<3-1,Bernadette>为啥从来没见你穿过呢
<3-1,Bernadette>How come I never see you wear it?

106
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,580
<3-2,Penny>因为我一直把它当上衣穿
<3-2,Penny>'Cause when I wear it, it's a shirt.

107

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,040
<3-5,Amy>我想检测一下他体内的血清素水平
<3-5,Amy>I'd love to check his serotonin levels.

<3-5,Amy>你觉得他会让我抽他一管血吗
<3-5,Amy>Do you think he'd let me draw a syringe full of his blood?

115
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,400
<3-6,Penny>他不喜欢针头
<3-6,Penny>Hmm, he's not crazy about needles,

126
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,450
<3-10,Amy>这不算什么
<3-10,Amy>That's nothing.

127
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,720
<3-10,Amy>九年级的时候  那些女生在我的护手霜里下洛盖尼(生发剂)

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,290
<3-10,Amy>最伤人的一个应该是猩猩手福勒
<3-10,Amy>I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.

130
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,690
<3-11,Penny>两个可怜的小姑娘
<3-11,Penny>Wow. You poor thing.

131
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,580
<3-12,Bernadette>-你呢  -我啊
<3-12,Bernadette>- What about you? - Oh.

132
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,720
<3-13,Penny>不知道哦  我们学校挺好的
<3-13,Penny>I don't know. I guess my school was a nice place.

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,850
<3-13,Penny>没有什么恶霸
<3-13,Penny>We didn't really have bullies.

134
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,720
<3-14,Amy>不是吧  从来没有人给别人取花名
<3-14,Amy>Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
<3-14,Amy>捉弄别人  在长毛的指节上粘口香糖
<3-14,Amy>or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
<3-14,Amy>搞得校医只能用花生酱才能弄下来?
<3-14,Amy>so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?

137
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,500
<3-15,Penny>没有  我们不会那样
<3-15,Penny>No, we weren't really like that.

138
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,050
<3-15,Penny>我们虽然会戏弄对方
<3-15,Penny>I mean, look, we played pranks on each other,

139
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,400
<3-15,Penny>但都是闹着玩的
<3-15,Penny>but it was never mean.

140
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,130
<3-15,Penny>比如有个女生  凯西·盖格
<3-15,Penny>Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger,

141
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,670
<3-15,Penny>考试经常得高分  于是我们蒙上她的眼睛
<3-15,Penny>got really good grades, so we blindfolded her,

142
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,730
<3-15,Penny>把她五花大绑到玉米地  留她在那过夜
<3-15,Penny>tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.

143
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,410
<3-16,Bernadette>天啊  太过分了
<3-16,Bernadette>Oh, my God, that's awful.

144
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,840
<3-17,Penny>才怪  好玩着呢  大家都笑了
<3-17,Penny>No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.

145
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,200
<3-18,Amy>凯西·盖格笑了吗
<3-18,Amy>Did Kathy Geiger laugh?

146
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,900
<3-19,Penny>不知道  很难说
<3-19,Penny>Uh, probably. It's hard to say.

147
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,040
<3-19,Penny>她嘴里塞满了玉米穗
<3-19,Penny>She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.

148
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,650
<3-20,Amy>谁能想到
<3-20,Amy>Who would have thought

149
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,360
<3-20,Amy>当年的毛手福勒现在变成恶霸的闺蜜
<3-20,Amy>Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,530
<3-21,Penny>什么  我才不是恶霸
<3-21,Penny>What? I was not a bully.

151
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,470
<3-22,Bernadette>可听着感觉你以前是
<3-22,Bernadette>Kind of sounds like you were.

152
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,140
<3-22,Bernadette>说不定还是个头头
<3-22,Bernadette>And maybe a felon.

153
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,320
<3-23,Amy>嘘  你想去玉米地过夜吗
<3-23,Amy>Shh. That's how you wind up in a cornfield.

154
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,710
<4-1,Raj>那边那个是他吗
<4-1,Raj>Is that him over there?

155
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,520
<4-2,Leonard>不是
<4-2,Leonard>No.

156
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,220
<4-3,Raj>那个呢
<4-3,Raj>How about that guy?

157
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,760
<4-3,Raj>他貌似很恨你
<4-3,Raj>He looks like he'd hate you.

158
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,360
<4-4,Leonard>你们其实不用来  我自己能搞定
<4-4,Leonard>You know, I can really do this by myself.

159
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,920
<4-5,Howard>兄弟  我们是来挺你的
<4-5,Howard>Hey, we're here to support you, buddy.

160
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,310
<4-6,Leonard>才怪  你们只是来看我
<4-6,Leonard>No, you're not. You're here to see

161
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,400
<4-6,Leonard>会不会被他扯内裤盖到头上
<4-6,Leonard>if I get my underwear pulled over my head.

162
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,650
<4-7,Howard>你居然穿内裤来  你个白痴
<4-7,Howard>You wore underwear? You fool.

163
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,540
<4-8,Raj>你想好怎么跟他说了吗
<4-8,Raj>So, have you figured out what you're going to say to him?

164
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,530
<4-9,Leonard>废话  他以前在学校这么欺负我
<4-9,Leonard>You bet. I am going to make him apologize

165
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,980
<4-9,Leonard>我要让我向我道歉
<4-9,Leonard>for all the crap he pulled on me in school.

166
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,430
<4-10,Howard>这单子真长
<4-10,Howard>That's quite a list.

167
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,280
<4-10,Howard>我看不懂你写的字
<4-10,Howard>I can't read your handwriting.

168
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,440
<4-10,Howard>这是什么字啊
<4-10,Howard>What's that word?

169
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,830
<4-11,Leonard>"阴囊"
<4-11,Leonard>"Scrotum."

170
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,570
<4-12,Raj>那这个呢
<4-12,Raj>What's that one?

171
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,990
<4-13,Leonard>"钉"
<4-13,Leonard>Uh, "Stapled."

172
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,990
<4-14,Jimmy (arriving)>莱纳德
<4-14,Jimmy (arriving)>Leonard.

173
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
<4-15,Leonard>嗨
<4-15,Leonard>Oh, hi.

174
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,200
<4-16,Jimmy>我的天哪  老兄  好久不见
<4-16,Jimmy>Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.

175
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,920
<4-17,Leonard>好久不见  吉米  这几位是
<4-17,Leonard>Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is

<4-17,Leonard>谢尔顿  拉杰  霍华德
<4-17,Leonard>Sheldon and Raj and Howard.

177
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,420
<4-18,Jimmy>你们好  喂  来瓶啤酒
<4-18,Jimmy>Hi. Fellas... Hey, can I get a beer?

178
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,110
<4-18,Jimmy>哇  瞧瞧你
<4-18,Jimmy>Wow. Look at you.

179
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,820
<4-18,Jimmy>小不点莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
<4-18,Jimmy>Little Leonard Hofstadter.

180
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
<4-18,Jimmy>我听说你现在是大科学家了
<4-18,Jimmy>I hear you're a big-time scientist now.

181
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,120
<4-19,Sheldon>这就开始讽刺了  真伤人
<4-19,Sheldon>And there's the first zinger. Ouch.

182
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,340
<4-20,Leonard>我现在马马虎虎啦
<4-20,Leonard>I'm doing okay, I guess.

183
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,710
<4-21,Jimmy>不是吧  我在网上看到
<4-21,Jimmy>Okay? Come on, I read online

184
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,450
<4-21,Jimmy>你现在是一所大学的物理学家
<4-21,Jimmy>you're a physicist at a university,

185
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,890
<4-21,Jimmy>你还得了奖呢
<4-21,Jimmy>you won some medal.

186
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,550
<4-22,Leonard>纽科姆奖
<4-22,Leonard>The Newcomb medal.

187
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,110
<4-23,Jimmy>对  恭喜恭喜

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,320
<4-24,Sheldon>纽科姆奖哦  拜托
<4-24,Sheldon>The Newcomb medal? Oh, please.

190
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,550
<4-24,Sheldon>那在科学界相当于
<4-24,Sheldon>That's the scientific equivalent

191
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,020
<4-24,Sheldon>小学作业本上得了朵小红花
<4-24,Sheldon>of a smiley face sticker on your homework.

192
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,840
<4-25,Jimmy>在我看来挺威风的
<4-25,Jimmy>From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.

193
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,900
<4-26,Sheldon>老天  我们就站在这里
<4-26,Sheldon>Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here

194
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,240
<4-26,Sheldon>听他用言语羞辱莱纳德吗
<4-26,Sheldon>and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?

195
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,240
<4-27,Raj>喂  我也赢过纽科姆奖
<4-27,Raj>Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,500
<4-28,Sheldon>我说得很清楚啦
<4-28,Sheldon>My point.

197
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,910
<4-29,Jimmy>你们真该看看这家伙小时候的样子
<4-29,Jimmy>You should have seen this guy back in the day.

198
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,650
<4-29,Jimmy>他个子小得  搁哪里都能塞进去
<4-29,Jimmy>Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere.

199
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,380
<4-29,Jimmy>柜子啦  垃圾桶啦
<4-29,Jimmy>Lockers, trash cans.

200
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,650
<4-29,Jimmy>老兄  你怎么钻进那个背包的
<4-29,Jimmy>Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?

201
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,200
<4-30,Leonard>功劳不全在我
<4-30,Leonard>Oh, I can't take all the credit.

202
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,340
<4-30,Leonard>-你可是帮了大忙  -对
<4-30,Leonard>- You helped a lot. - Yeah.

203
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,450
<4-31,Jimmy>咱俩简直就是个搞笑队伍
<4-31,Jimmy>We were practically a comedy team.

204
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,210
<4-32,Howard>就像黑死病席卷欧洲一样
<4-32,Howard>Like the Black Death and Europe.

205
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,730
<4-33,Leonard>吉米  我很好奇你为什么想见我
<4-33,Leonard>Jimmy, I'm kind of curious why you wanted to see me.

206
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,280
<4-34,Jimmy>是这样的
<4-34,Jimmy>Okay, here it is.

207
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,000
<4-34,Jimmy>我想到一个绝佳的赚钱点子
<4-34,Jimmy>I have this great money-making idea.

208
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,130
<4-34,Jimmy>现在只差一个机械行家来完成
<4-34,Jimmy>I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.

209
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,990
<4-35,Sheldon>严格来说  霍华德才是机械行家
<4-35,Sheldon>Technically, Howard's the gear head.

210
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,150
<4-35,Sheldon>莱纳德只是低级的激光操作员
<4-35,Sheldon>Leonard's just a dime store laser jockey.

211
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,230
<4-36,Leonard>什么赚钱点子
<4-36,Leonard>What's the idea?

212
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,440
<4-37,Jimmy>这点子不能外传啊
<4-37,Jimmy>This is just between us, right?

213
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,630
<4-38,Leonard>-行  -好
<4-38,Leonard>- Right. - Okay.

214
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,910
<4-39,Jimmy>你们觉得一副能让任何电影
<4-39,Jimmy>What do you think about a pair of glasses

215
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,760
<4-39,Jimmy>变得立体的眼镜怎么样
<4-39,Jimmy>that makes any movie you want into 3D?

216
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,940
<4-40,Raj>那太帅了
<4-40,Raj>That sounds amazing.

218
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,970
<4-40,Raj>我第一个要看的电影就是《安妮》
<4-40,Raj>First movie I'm watching-- Annie.

219
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
<4-41,Howard>这种眼镜怎么做
<4-41,Howard>How exactly would these glasses work?

220
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,500
<4-42,Jimmy>我要是知道还用得着找一个书呆子吗
<4-42,Jimmy>How the hell should I know? That's why I need a nerd.

221
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,400
<4-43,Leonard>我觉得这玩意儿行不通
<4-43,Leonard>I don't think something like that's even possible.

222
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,370
<4-44,Jimmy>拜托  你一定有办法的
<4-44,Jimmy>Aw, come on, you can figure it out.

223
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,100
<4-44,Jimmy>你是我认识的最聪明的人了
<4-44,Jimmy>You're like the smartest guy I've ever known.

224
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,070
<4-45,Sheldon>最聪明的  好吧
<4-45,Sheldon>The smartest...?! All right,

225
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,440
<4-45,Sheldon>我可能对挖苦讽刺什么的不在行
<4-45,Sheldon>you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm,

226
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,340
<4-45,Sheldon>可就连我都知道  你该用"出色"而不是"聪明"
<4-45,Sheldon>but even I know that was a doozy.

227
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,370
<4-45,Sheldon>莱纳德  你不能永远活在对这个人的恐惧之下
<4-45,Sheldon>Leonard, you can't live in fear of this man forever.

228
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,990
<4-46,Leonard>谢尔顿  我自己能处理
<4-46,Leonard>Sheldon, I got this.

229
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,530
<4-47,Sheldon>你显然不能
<4-47,Sheldon>You clearly don't.

230
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,890
<4-47,Sheldon>我这个没骨气的朋友没胆量说的是
<4-47,Sheldon>What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say

231
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,960
<4-47,Sheldon>你是一个利用了
<4-47,Sheldon>is you're a terrible person

232
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,290
<4-47,Sheldon>他的矮小
<4-47,Sheldon>who took advantage of his tiny size,

233
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,430
<4-47,Sheldon>身体协调能力缺乏
<4-47,Sheldon>his uncoordinated nature and

234
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,540
<4-47,Sheldon>和先天男子气概缺失的恶人
<4-47,Sheldon>his congenital lack of masculinity.

235
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,050
<4-48,Leonard>谢尔顿
<4-48,Leonard>Sheldon...

236
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,140
<4-49,Sheldon>莱纳德  在精神上我还是挺喜欢你的  兄弟
<4-49,Sheldon>Leonard, I platonically love you, man,

237
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,980
<4-49,Sheldon>但是请你面对现实  你就是一团糟
<4-49,Sheldon>but face it, you're a mess.

238
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,220
<4-50,Jimmy>我都糊涂了
<4-50,Jimmy>I don't understand.

239
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,520
<4-51,Leonard>我想他要说的是  或许在高中时
<4-51,Leonard>I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school

240
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,090
<4-51,Leonard>你有点欺负我
<4-51,Leonard>you picked on me a little bit.

241
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,920
<4-52,Sheldon>有点儿
<4-52,Sheldon>A little bit?

242
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,170
<4-52,Sheldon>这家伙把好时之吻巧克力用超能胶粘在你的乳头上
<4-52,Sheldon>The man super glued Hershey's Kisses to your nipples.

243
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,460
<4-53,Raj>有意思的是  高中时期你的乳头
<4-53,Raj>That's funny because those aren't the kind of kisses

244
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,960
<4-53,Raj>要的可不是巧克力的吻
<4-53,Raj>you want on your nipples.

245
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,670
<4-54,Jimmy>那张纸是什么
<4-54,Jimmy>What is that?

246
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,770
<4-55,Sheldon>这张单子上列满了你对莱纳德做过的可憎行径
<4-55,Sheldon>This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard.

247
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,500
<4-55,Sheldon>其中肯定有一项导致他
<4-55,Sheldon>One of which is certainly the cause

248
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,770
<4-55,Sheldon>直到十几岁了还尿床
<4-55,Sheldon>of him wetting his bed well into his teens.

249
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,340
<4-56,Leonard>十四岁不算是  算了
<4-56,Leonard>14 is not... Aw, never mind.

250
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,220
<4-57,Jimmy>这个是什么字
<4-57,Jimmy>What's this word?

251
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,220
<4-58,Leonard>"南希"
<4-58,Leonard>"Nancy".

252
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,190
<4-58,Leonard>你管我叫"南希"叫了三年
<4-58,Leonard>You called me Nancy for three years.

253
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,640
<4-59,Sheldon>你真该好好练练字了
<4-59,Sheldon>You really need to work on your penmanship.

254
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,090
<4-60,Jimmy>天啊  我
<4-60,Jimmy>Oh, man, I...

255
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,400
<4-60,Jimmy>我不知道该说什么了
<4-60,Jimmy>I don't know what to say.

256
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,090
<4-60,Jimmy>我一直以为我们都乐在其中
<4-60,Jimmy>I always thought we were just having some fun.

257
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,340
<4-61,Leonard>我可一点都乐不起来
<4-61,Leonard>It wasn't fun for me.

258
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,370
<4-62,Sheldon>你用词太客气了  莱纳德
<4-62,Sheldon>You're being too kind, Leonard.

259
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,190
<4-62,Sheldon>你把他给毁了
<4-62,Sheldon>You ruined him.

260
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,880
<4-63,Leonard>走吧  伙计们
<4-63,Leonard>Come on, guys.

261
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,010
<4-64,Raj>你刚才还真厉害  兄弟
<4-64,Raj>That was pretty badass, dude.

262
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,750
<4-65,Sheldon>我向来帮助弱者
<4-65,Sheldon>I help the weak.

263
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,100
<4-65,Sheldon>又一次证明了我就是蝙蝠侠在世
<4-65,Sheldon>It's yet another way I'm exactly like Batman.

264
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,520
<4-66,Leonard>澄清一下  害我尿床的人不是吉米
<4-66,Leonard>Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed.

265
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,500
<4-66,Leonard>那都是我妈害的
<4-66,Leonard>That one has my mother written all over it.

266
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,960
<5-1,Penny>总之我很抱歉
<5-1,Penny>Anyway, I'm really sorry

267
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,320
<5-1,Penny>高中的时候一直笑你口吃
<5-1,Penny>I made fun of your stutter in high school.

268
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,990
<5-2,Bernadette>你干得很好
<5-2,Bernadette>You're doing great.

269
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,190
<5-3,Penny>天啊  等她说完费死劲了
<5-3,Penny>Oh, God, just finish the sentence.

270
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,970
<5-3,Penny>好吧  抱歉让你难过了  再见
<5-3,Penny>Okay, well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Bye.

271
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,710
<5-3,Penny>没人想听我道歉
<5-3,Penny>No one wants to hear my apologies.

272
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,710
<5-4,Amy>我认为你不该在电话上道歉
<5-4,Amy>I think your mistake is doing it over the phone.

273
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,950
<5-4,Amy>如果她们能看着你那无辜的大眼睛  铁定会被你融化的
<5-4,Amy>If they could look into your eyes, they'd melt.

274
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,520
<5-5,Bernadette>佩妮  你过去做过什么都不重要
<5-5,Bernadette>Penny, it doesn't matter what you did in the past.

275
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,180
<5-5,Bernadette>重要的是你现在是个好人
<5-5,Bernadette>You're a good person now.

276
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,680
<5-6,Penny>你说得倒是容易
<5-6,Penny>That's easy for you to say.

277
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,380
<5-6,Penny>别人又没管你叫"婊婊婊婊婊婊子"
<5-6,Penny>You weren't just called a "B-b-b-b-bitch".

278
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,630
<5-7,Amy>也许你可以通过做善事来减轻你的负罪感
<5-7,Amy>Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism.

279
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,090
<5-7,Amy>你是哪个词没听懂
<5-7,Amy>Which word's tripping you up?

280
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,980
<5-7,Amy>"减轻"还是"负罪感"
<5-7,Amy>"Assuage", or "altruism"?

281
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,440
<5-8,Penny>俩都没懂
<5-8,Penny>Both.

282
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,210
<5-9,Bernadette>通过帮助别人  让你的心好过一点
<5-9,Bernadette>You'll feel better by doing something nice for someone.

283
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,260
<5-10,Penny>-其实我是懂的  -我从没怀疑过你的实力
<5-10,Penny>- I actually knew that.  - I never doubted you.

284
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,530
<5-12,Bernadette>每隔一个星期我都会去市中心的一家汤店去帮忙
<5-12,Bernadette>Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.

285
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,250
<5-13,Penny>这不行
<5-13,Penny>Ooh, I can't do that.

286
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,750
<5-13,Penny>如果我站在一锅冒热气的汤前  我的头发就会全炸开
<5-13,Penny>If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing!

287
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,020
<5-13,Penny>我还能干点别的什么
<5-13,Penny>What else could I do?

288
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,460
<5-14,Amy>还有仁爱之家活动
<5-14,Amy>There's Habitat for Humanity --

289
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,890
<5-14,Amy>给穷人盖房子
<5-14,Amy>building houses for the poor.

290
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,140
<5-15,Penny>拜托  我自己都没有房子
<5-15,Penny>Okay, come on, I don't even have my own house --

291
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,550
<5-15,Penny>又何德何能给别人盖呢
<5-15,Penny>I'm going to build one for someone else?

292
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,800
<5-16,Amy>那捐赠你的一些衣服怎么样
<5-16,Amy>How about donating some of your clothes?

293
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,670
<5-16,Amy>天啊  这太完美了
<5-16,Amy>Oh, my God, that's perfect.

294
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,970
<5-17,Penny>因为我有太多不穿的衣服了
<5-17,Penny>'Cause I have so many clothesI don't wear,

295
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,950
<5-17,Penny>衣橱都装不下了
<5-17,Penny>and they're just taking up space,

296
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,060
<5-17,Penny>我每次逛街还总爱买
<5-17,Penny>and I go shopping to buy more stuff

297
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,240
<5-17,Penny>新衣服都没地方放了
<5-17,Penny>and I have no place to put it.

298
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,710
<5-17,Penny>这下我的麻烦就都解决了
<5-17,Penny>This will totally fix that.

299
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,080
<5-18,Bernadette>那助人为乐呢
<5-18,Bernadette>What about helping people?

300
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,960
<5-19,Penny>外加助人为乐
<5-19,Penny>And helping people.

301
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,370
<6-1,Leonard>这是你的可可
<6-1,Leonard>Here's your cocoa.

302
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,990
<6-2,Sheldon>-你放的是半脱脂奶不是全脂奶吧  -没错
<6-2,Sheldon>- Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?  - Yes.

303
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,390
<6-4,Sheldon>-精确加热到了83.89度了吗  -没错
<6-4,Sheldon>- Heated to precisely 183 degrees?  - Yes.

304
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,290
<6-6,Sheldon>正好七块小棉花糖  不多不少吗
<6-6,Sheldon>Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?

305
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,780
<6-7,Leonard>你运气好  多给你一块
<6-7,Leonard>You got one for good luck.

306
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,260
<6-7,Leonard>我去开门
<6-7,Leonard>I'll get it.

307
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,730
<6-7,Leonard>我运气好  多给我一块
<6-7,Leonard>One for good luck.

308
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,910
<6-8,Sheldon>这数学水平跟普林斯顿大学有一拼
<6-8,Sheldon>Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.

309
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,130
<6-10,Leonard>你来干嘛
<6-10,Leonard>What are you doing here?

310
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,510
<6-11,Jimmy>我来道歉  就用订书机订你的蛋蛋
<6-11,Jimmy>I want to apologize for...stapling your balls and...

311
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,980
<6-11,Jimmy>把你脱光了丢进女生更衣室
<6-11,Jimmy>...throwing you naked in the girls' locker room,

312
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,580
<6-11,Jimmy>还有把胡萝卜塞到你裤子里向你道歉
<6-11,Jimmy>stuffing that parrot down your pants.

313
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,720
<6-12,Leonard>这个是什么字
<6-12,Leonard>What's this word?

314
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,470
<6-13,Jimmy>-"泻药"  -没错
<6-13,Jimmy>- "Laxative".  - Oh, right.

315
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,160
<6-13,Jimmy>初中毕业舞会
<6-13,Jimmy>Junior prom.

316
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,450
<6-13,Jimmy>那样做太过分了  伙计
<6-13,Jimmy>That was not cool, man.

317
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,660
<6-13,Jimmy>我真的非常非常抱歉
<6-13,Jimmy>I am so, so sorry.

318
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,970
<6-14,Leonard>真的吗
<6-14,Leonard>Really?

319
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,740
<6-15,Jimmy>是啊  我只希望你能原谅我
<6-15,Jimmy>Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.

320
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,170
<6-15,Jimmy>好啊
<6-15,Jimmy>Yeah.

321
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,460
<6-16,Leonard>我想我原谅你了
<6-16,Leonard>Sure, I guess.

322
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,770
<6-17,Jimmy>你真是个大好人
<6-17,Jimmy>You're a beautiful guy.

323
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,580
<6-18,Leonard>谢谢  吉米
<6-18,Leonard>Well, thanks, Jimmy.

324
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,620
<6-19,Jimmy>好了  我该走了
<6-19,Jimmy>Okay, I got to go.

325
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,080
<6-20,Leonard>你还能开车吗
<6-20,Leonard>Are you okay to drive?

326
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,280
<6-21,Jimmy>当然  我喝醉了开得更好
<6-21,Jimmy>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk.

327
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,890
<6-21,Jimmy>酒精让人注意力更集中
<6-21,Jimmy>You know, it makes you pay attention.

328
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,730
<6-22,Leonard>不行不行  进来  喝杯咖啡先
<6-22,Leonard>No, no, no, come on in. I'll make you a cup of coffee.

329
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,060
<6-23,Jimmy>-不打扰吗  -不会
<6-23,Jimmy>- I wouldn't be imposing? - No.

330
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,270
<6-25,Sheldon>当然会
<6-25,Sheldon>Yes.

331
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,440
<6-26,Leonard>谢尔顿  他现在不能开车
<6-26,Leonard>Sheldon, we can't let him drive.

332
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,000
<6-27,Sheldon>那就拿走他的车钥匙  让他跟其他醉鬼一起
<6-27,Sheldon>Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,880
<6-27,Sheldon>去大街上游荡去呗
<6-27,Sheldon>with the other drunks.

334
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,470
<6-28,Leonard>刚介绍过的  谢尔顿  拉杰和霍华德
<6-28,Leonard>You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.

335
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,040
<6-29,Jimmy>没啥印象
<6-29,Jimmy>Not really, no.

336
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,750
<6-29,Jimmy>人生如戏啊  莱纳德
<6-29,Jimmy>It's funny, huh, Leonard?

337
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,650
<6-29,Jimmy>学校里  我是赢家你是输家
<6-29,Jimmy>Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser.

338
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,720
<6-29,Jimmy>现在正好相反
<6-29,Jimmy>And now we're reversed.

339
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,150
<6-29,Jimmy>你成了赢家
<6-29,Jimmy>You're the winner.

340
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,040
<6-30,Sheldon>赢家居然连一杯像样的可可都做不好
<6-30,Sheldon>You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.

341
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,060
<6-31,Jimmy>-我用下洗手间可以吗  -当然  就在走廊后
<6-31,Jimmy>- You mind if I use your bathroom? - Yeah, just back there.

342
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,500
<6-32,Leonard>感觉如何呀
<6-32,Leonard>How about that?

343
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,950
<6-33,Howard>这么多年后  欺负你的高中恶霸
<6-33,Howard>After all these years, your big bad high school bully

344
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,450
<6-33,Howard>终于跟你道歉了
<6-33,Howard>finally apologizes.

345
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,240
<6-34,Leonard>真好啊  恢复了我对
<6-34,Leonard>Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith

346
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,420
<6-34,Leonard>人性本善的信心
<6-34,Leonard>in the basic goodness of people.

347
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,980
<6-35,Sheldon>知道什么才是真的好吗
<6-35,Sheldon>You know what would be nice?

348
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,920
<6-36,Raj>什么
<6-36,Raj>What's that?

349
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,990
<6-37,Sheldon>可以将吉米看作
<6-37,Sheldon>As a symbolic gesture

350
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,640
<6-37,Sheldon>多年来欺负我们的所有恶霸的象征
<6-37,Sheldon>to all the bullies who've tormented us for years,

351
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,840
<6-37,Sheldon>我们先引狼入室  然后趁他入睡杀了他
<6-37,Sheldon>we open our home to Jimmy and once he's asleep we kill him.

352
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,820
<6-37,Sheldon>我是说这样很好  不是说真要这么做
<6-37,Sheldon>I said it would be nice-- I didn't say we should do it.

353
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,650
<7-1,Penny>我觉得自己就像特蕾莎修女
<7-1,Penny>I feel just like Mother Teresa.

355
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,440
<7-1,Penny>除了童贞那部分
<7-1,Penny>Except for the virgin part.

357
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,340
<7-1,Penny>姐的早就奉献出去了
<7-1,Penny>That ship sailed a long time ago.

358
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,270
<7-2,Bernadette>我觉得特蕾莎修女会先把衣服洗干净
<7-2,Bernadette>I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.

359
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,030
<7-3,Penny>是啊  但愿她去洗衣房
<7-3,Penny>Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room

360
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,090
<7-3,Penny>不用走整整五层楼
<7-3,Penny>wasn't down five flights of stairs.

361
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,950
<7-3,Penny>付出真的比得到更幸福呢
<7-3,Penny>You know, giving really is better than receiving.
