1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,120
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>我的新书《隐藏的真相》讨论了一个很大的问题
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>My new book The Hidden Reality takes on a grand question:

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,380
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>我们的宇宙是唯一的吗
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>Is our universe the only universe?

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,610
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>越来越多像我这样的科学家相信
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>You see, there's a growing belief among scientists like me

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,110
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>我们也许只是茫茫空间里众多宇宙中的
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>that ours may only be one among many universes

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,740
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>其中一个
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>populating a gigantic cosmos.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,970
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>在《隐藏的真相》中  我在不涉及
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,330
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>任何数学和物理知识的情况下
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,740
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>向读者阐释了这一可能
<1-1,Dr. Brian Greene>on the part of the reader.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,010
<1-2,Sheldon>可笑至极
<1-2,Sheldon>Hysterical.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,060
<1-3,Amy>很高兴你说服我来这里
<1-3,Amy>I'm glad you talked me into this.

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,400
<1-3,Amy>咱们平时太辛苦了  有时候偷个闲
<1-3,Amy>We work so hard, sometimes, it's nice to goof off

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,110
<1-3,Amy>-干点儿蠢事儿也挺好的  -没错
<1-3,Amy>- and do something silly. - Agreed.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,580
<1-4,Sheldon>你等着听他跟大家胡扯沃纳·海森堡吧
<1-4,Sheldon>Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,330
<1-4,Sheldon>你都会觉得自己是在德云社听相声
<1-4,Sheldon>You may actually believe you're in a comedy club.

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,780
<1-5,Greene>你可以觉得海森堡的"不确定性原理"
<1-5,Greene>You can think about Heisenberg's "uncertainty principle"

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,940
<1-5,Greene>就像是在某些中国餐馆里的
<1-5,Greene>much like the special order menu

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,360
<1-5,Greene>每日特供菜单  你会发现有些菜
<1-5,Greene>that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,110
<1-5,Greene>在A栏里  有些菜在B栏里
<1-5,Greene>dishes in column A and other dishes in column B,

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,670
<1-5,Greene>如果你点了A栏里的第一道菜
<1-5,Greene>and if you order the first dish in column A,

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,680
<1-5,Greene>你就不能点B栏里的第一道菜了
<1-5,Greene>you can't order the corresponding dish in column B.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,890
<1-5,Greene>这就有点像"不确定性原理"
<1-5,Greene>That's sort of like the "uncertainly principle."

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,940
<1-6,Sheldon>当里个当
<1-6,Sheldon>Ba-dum-bump.

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,010
<1-7,Amy>说起来  我听说了霍华德和
<1-7,Amy>Say, I heard an interesting tidbit

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,700
<1-7,Amy>伯纳黛特的一件趣事儿
<1-7,Amy>about Howard and Bernadette.

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,850
<1-8,Sheldon>你开玩笑吧  艾米  跟我聊八卦
<1-8,Sheldon>Really, Amy? Gossip?

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,160
<1-8,Sheldon>我对你失望了
<1-8,Sheldon>I'm disappointed in you.

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,410
<1-8,Sheldon>别急啊
<1-8,Sheldon>No, now.

28
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,570
<1-9,Amy>进化生物学家罗宾·邓巴把八卦定义为
<1-9,Amy>Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,360
<1-9,Amy>一种有助于在大群体内维系感情的手段
<1-9,Amy>as an aid to social bonding in large groups.

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,550
<1-10,Sheldon>恕我直言  全是扯淡
<1-10,Sheldon>Forgive my language, but "poppycock".

31
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,940
<1-11,Amy>万一不是呢
<1-11,Amy>What if he's right?

32
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,850
<1-11,Amy>如果没有八卦
<1-11,Amy>And by not participating in gossip,

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,150
<1-11,Amy>社会就会分裂成为
<1-11,Amy>society breaks down into

34
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,550
<1-11,Amy>一个个纹身摩托车手组成的野蛮小帮派
<1-11,Amy>small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders

35
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,480
<1-11,Amy>为了最后几罐金枪鱼罐头打得死去活来
<1-11,Amy>fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish.

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,190
<1-11,Amy>好吧
<1-11,Amy>Fine.

37
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,600
<1-12,Sheldon>用城市音乐[黑人音乐]的术语来说
<1-12,Sheldon>In the parlance of the urban music scene,

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,590
<1-12,Sheldon>"你想跟我说啥"
<1-12,Sheldon>"what's the 4-1-1"?

40
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,230
<1-13,Amy>伯纳黛特想和霍华德分手
<1-13,Amy>Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.

41
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,270
<1-14,Sheldon>我觉得咱国家的金枪鱼罐头还是安全的
<1-14,Sheldon>I believe our nation's tuna cans are safe.

42
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,520
<1-14,Sheldon>抱歉等下聊  格林博士  我能提问吗
<1-14,Sheldon>Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,460
<1-15,Greene>请讲
<1-15,Greene>Yes?

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,270
<1-16,Sheldon>您一直致力于
<1-16,Sheldon>You've dedicated your life's work

45
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,310
<1-16,Sheldon>向公众宣传灌输一些
<1-16,Sheldon>to educating the general populace

46
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,800
<1-16,Sheldon>复杂的科学理念
<1-16,Sheldon>about complex scientific ideas.

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,060
<1-17,Greene>对  差不多
<1-17,Greene>Yes, in part.

48
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,200
<1-18,Sheldon>您有没有考虑过
<1-18,Sheldon>Have you ever considered

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,610
<1-18,Sheldon>干点儿更有意义的事儿呢
<1-18,Sheldon>trying to do something useful?

50
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,680
<1-18,Sheldon>比如  给老人念书
<1-18,Sheldon>Perhaps, reading to the elderly?

51
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,040
<1-19,Greene>你说什么
<1-19,Greene>Excuse me?

52
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,120
<1-20,Sheldon>嗯  不过别念你的书  念点儿他们喜欢的
<1-20,Sheldon>Yeah, but not your books; something they might enjoy.

53
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,910
<1-20,Sheldon>当然咯  我开玩笑啦  支持你哦
<1-20,Sheldon>I kid, of course. Big fan.

54
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,400
<1-20,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-20,Sheldon>第四季第二十集

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,950
<2-1,Leonard>-射得好  -多谢
<2-1,Leonard>- Nice shot. - Thank you.

56
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,970
<2-2,Sheldon>我父亲从小就在训练我射箭了
<2-2,Sheldon>My father taught me archery as a child.

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,510
<2-2,Sheldon>真没想到这项运动居然能唤起
<2-2,Sheldon>It's odd how the activity

58
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,810
<2-2,Sheldon>印象中凯马特波旁酒的醇香[他父亲酗酒]
<2-2,Sheldon>brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.

59
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,750
<2-3,Leonard>-漂亮  -我知道
<2-3,Leonard>- Perfect. - I know.

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,110
<2-4,Sheldon>我肯定能当个出色的精灵
<2-4,Sheldon>What an elf I would have made.

61
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,550
<2-4,Sheldon>你觉得你在干嘛呢
<2-4,Sheldon>What do you think you're doing?

62
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,740
<2-5,Leonard>冲着靶子射箭啊
<2-5,Leonard>Shooting at a target?

63
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,080
<2-6,Sheldon>拿什么射
<2-6,Sheldon>With what?

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,670
<2-7,Leonard>-箭啊  -你开玩笑吧
<2-7,Leonard>- An arrow. - Really?

65
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,990
<2-8,Sheldon>我都没看见你从箭筒里取箭
<2-8,Sheldon>I didn't see you draw one from your quiver.

66
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,560
<2-9,Leonard>我不会这么傻的  谢尔顿
<2-9,Leonard>I'm not going to do that, Sheldon.

67
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,900
<2-10,Sheldon>莱纳德  任天堂的人在重现真实的
<2-10,Sheldon>Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far

68
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,740
<2-10,Sheldon>竞技体验这方面只能做到这份儿上了
<2-10,Sheldon>in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience.

69
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,530
<2-10,Sheldon>剩下的得靠我们自己
<2-10,Sheldon>We have to do our part, too.

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,100
<2-10,Sheldon>虽然比较出乎意料  但是
<2-10,Sheldon>That was uncalled for, but...

71
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,680
<2-10,Sheldon>我还是配合一下吧  痛
<2-10,Sheldon>I'll play along. Ow.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,510
<2-10,Sheldon>我昨晚和艾米有一次非凡的体验
<2-10,Sheldon>I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.

73
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,240
<2-11,Leonard>真的吗  你怎么感觉出来的
<2-11,Leonard>Really? How could you tell?

74
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,480
<2-12,Sheldon>她想和我聊八卦
<2-12,Sheldon>She was attempting to engage me in gossip.

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,070
<2-13,Leonard>-你肯定不干  -对
<2-13,Leonard>- Mm. You don't say. - Yes.

76
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,740
<2-14,Sheldon>我觉得跟佩妮混时间长了
<2-14,Sheldon>I think prolonged exposure to Penny

77
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,380
<2-14,Sheldon>她也变得有点儿女孩子气了
<2-14,Sheldon>has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.

78
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,560
<2-15,Leonard>什么八卦啊
<2-15,Leonard>So, what's the gossip?

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,730
<2-16,Sheldon>拜托  我都说了
<2-16,Sheldon>Oh, please, I was just pointing it out.

80
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,120
<2-16,Sheldon>我对这种东西完全没兴趣
<2-16,Sheldon>I have no desire to engage in the activity.

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,650
<2-17,Leonard>好吧  那就别跟我说了
<2-17,Leonard>Fine, don't tell me.

82
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,660
<2-18,Sheldon>好吧  听着
<2-18,Sheldon>All right, get this.

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,730
<2-18,Sheldon>伯纳黛特想和霍华德分手
<2-18,Sheldon>Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.

84
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,860
<2-19,Leonard>真糟糕  出什么事儿了啊
<2-19,Leonard>That's too bad. I wonder what happened.

85
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,960
<2-20,Sheldon>不好说  我只能推测一下
<2-20,Sheldon>Mm, it's hard to say. I can only speculate

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,410
<2-20,Sheldon>根据我观察我父母的婚姻分崩离析
<2-20,Sheldon>based on the data I collected

87
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,930
<2-20,Sheldon>所得到的数据
<2-20,Sheldon>watching my parents' marriage implode.

88
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,640
<2-20,Sheldon>在我们家  我妈一头扎进了宗教的海洋
<2-20,Sheldon>In that case, the woman dives into religion,

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,760
<2-20,Sheldon>而我爸则一头扎进了金发女酒保的怀抱
<2-20,Sheldon>while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender

90
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,470
<2-20,Sheldon>那女人还想用超级英雄的玩具收买我呢
<2-20,Sheldon>who tries to buy my love with action figures.

91
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,710
<2-20,Sheldon>啊哦  没箭了
<2-20,Sheldon>Oop! Out of arrows.

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,750
<2-21,Leonard>天啊  你这游戏买的真是太值了
<2-21,Leonard>Boy, you sure get your money's worth out of these games.

93
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,430
<3-1,Leonard>-普丽娅  我能进来吗  -进吧
<3-1,Leonard>- Priya, can I come in? - Sure.

94
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,690
<3-3,Leonard>天啊
<3-3,Leonard>Oh, God.

95
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,780
<3-4,Priya>-怎么了  -没事
<3-4,Priya>- What? - It's okay.

96
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,450
<3-5,Leonard>你不知道罢了  我来处理吧
<3-5,Leonard>You didn't know. I'll take care of it.

97
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,450
<3-6,Priya>我  我做错什么了
<3-6,Priya>What-what did I do?

98
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,990
<3-7,Leonard>谢尔顿禁止在离镜子
<3-7,Leonard>Sheldon doesn't allow flossing

99
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,680
<3-7,Leonard>这么近的地方用牙线
<3-7,Leonard>that close to the mirror.

100
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,050
<3-8,Priya>你开玩笑吧
<3-8,Priya>You're kidding.

101
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,690
<3-9,Leonard>会溅上去的
<3-9,Leonard>It's a splatter thing.

102
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,000
<3-9,Leonard>地板上贴了一小段胶带
<3-9,Leonard>There's a little piece of tape on the floor

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,620
<3-9,Leonard>你得站在胶带后面
<3-9,Leonard>you're supposed to stand behind.

104
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,400
<3-10,Priya>-太雷人了  -我知道
<3-10,Priya>- That's madness. - I know.

105
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,380
<3-11,Leonard>照做吧  待会儿会有大检查
<3-11,Leonard>Just do it. There's a big inspection coming up,

106
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,810
<3-11,Leonard>我可不想失去看电视的特权
<3-11,Leonard>and I don't want to lose my TV privileges.

107
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,440
<3-12,Priya>你迟早得让我看一眼
<3-12,Priya>You really need to let me take a look

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,500
<3-12,Priya>那个室友协议
<3-12,Priya>at that roommate agreement, one of these days.

109
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,990
<3-13,Leonard>有这必要吗
<3-13,Leonard>Mm, I don't know.

110
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,860
<3-13,Leonard>我俩各自请律师对簿公堂吗
<3-13,Leonard>I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer...

111
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,970
<3-13,Leonard>还是老老实实站黄线后算了
<3-13,Leonard>It's just easier to stand behind the tape.

112
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,560
<3-14,Priya>对了  我一个同事说
<3-14,Priya>Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said

113
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,320
<3-14,Priya>要给我周末道奇队比赛的门票
<3-14,Priya>I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend.

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
<3-14,Priya>-应该很好玩吧  -那是
<3-14,Priya>- Does that sound like fun?  - Yeah!

115
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,870
<3-15,Leonard>道奇是棒球队  对吧
<3-15,Leonard>Dodgers are baseball, right?

116
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,270
<3-16,Priya>你到时候得给我解释一下比赛规则
<3-16,Priya>You'll need to explain the game to me.

117
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,080
<3-17,Leonard>规则很复杂的
<3-17,Leonard>Mm, it's complicated.

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,980
<3-17,Leonard>不过在我看来  棒球的精髓就是
<3-17,Leonard>But as I remember it, the essentials are

119
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,870
<3-17,Leonard>最后才被选中  被球打  痛哭  回家
<3-17,Leonard>"get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home" .

120
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,170
<3-18,Priya>不管怎么说都好  我有四张票呢
<3-18,Priya>Well, regardless, I've got four tickets.

121
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,500
<3-18,Priya>叫上伯纳黛特和霍华德一起去好吗
<3-18,Priya>And I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard.

122
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,580
<3-18,Priya>伯纳黛特真的很有意思
<3-18,Priya>She's really interesting,

123
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,330
<3-18,Priya>我想我早晚也能适应霍华德的存在
<3-18,Priya>and I bet I can get used to him.

124
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,570
<3-19,Leonard>叫他俩去可能
<3-19,Leonard>Well, it might not be a great idea

125
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,600
<3-19,Leonard>-不太好  -为什么
<3-19,Leonard>- to invite those two.  - Why not?

126
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,910
<3-21,Leonard>别跟别人说是我说的
<3-21,Leonard>Don't tell anybody I told you,

127
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,010
<3-21,Leonard>不过据说伯纳黛特可能要跟霍华德分手
<3-21,Leonard>but I heard she might be breaking up with him.

128
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,020
<3-22,Priya>太可惜了
<3-22,Priya>Oh...too bad...

129
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,570
<3-22,Priya>不过我倒认识一个会因此高兴的人
<3-22,Priya>Although I do know one person for whom that's good news.

130
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,430
<3-23,Leonard>真的吗  谁呀
<3-23,Leonard>Really? Who?

131
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,380
<3-24,Priya>我哥
<3-24,Priya>My brother.

132
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,210
<3-24,Priya>他超喜欢伯纳黛特
<3-24,Priya>He's got a big crush on Bernadette.

133
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,880
<3-25,Leonard>什么
<3-25,Leonard>What?

134
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,660
<3-25,Leonard>你开玩笑吧
<3-25,Leonard>You're kidding.

135
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,390
<3-26,Priya>没有  我看到过他给她写的诗
<3-26,Priya>No. I found poems he wrote about her.

136
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,240
<3-26,Priya>超诡异的
<3-26,Priya>Very disturbing.

137
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,020
<3-26,Priya>"噢  伯纳黛特  吹响我的单簧管吧"
<3-26,Priya>"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet" .

138
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,220
<3-27,Leonard>-这太难以置信了  -就是说呀
<3-27,Leonard>- Wow, that's hard to believe.  - Yes.

139
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,080
<3-28,Priya>这么多年来  我家所有人
<3-28,Priya>And for years, everyone in my family

140
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,280
<3-28,Priya>都坚信他有同性恋倾向呢
<3-28,Priya>was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast.

141
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,080
<3-28,Priya>这条黄线又是干嘛的
<3-28,Priya>What's that piece of tape?

142
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,400
<3-29,Leonard>你用不着担心这个  反正你坐着上厕所
<3-29,Leonard>Oh, that one doesn't apply to you. You sit.

143
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,440
<4-2,Penny>近来好吗
<4-2,Penny>How's it going?

144
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,870
<4-3,Leonard>还不错  你听说伯纳黛特和霍华德的事了吗
<4-3,Leonard>Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?

<4-4,Penny>当然了  你是怎么知道的
<4-4,Penny>'Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?

146
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,600
<4-5,Leonard>我是听谢尔顿说的
<4-5,Leonard>I heard about it from Sheldon.

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
<4-5,Leonard>-他是听艾米说的  -该死
<4-5,Leonard>- He got it from Amy.  - Oh, damn it.

148
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,600
<4-6,Penny>我还叫艾米绝对不能告诉别人呢
<4-6,Penny>I told Amy that in the strictest confidence.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,210
<4-6,Penny>有些人还真是大嘴巴
<4-6,Penny>Boy, some people are such blabbermouths.

150
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,900
<4-6,Penny>随便啦
<4-6,Penny>Well, whatever.

151
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,990
<4-6,Penny>我相信伯纳黛特肯定能找到更好的
<4-6,Penny>I'm sure Bernadette can do better.

152
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,100
<4-7,Leonard>你觉得一个有选择性缄默症  酗酒问题
<4-7,Leonard>Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist

153
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,380
<4-7,Leonard>而且性取向不稳定的印度天体物理学家
<4-7,Leonard>with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than

154
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,120
<4-7,Leonard>比体重一百磅  跟老妈住的犹太人强吗
<4-7,Leonard>a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?

155
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,020
<4-8,Penny>你开玩笑吧  拉杰喜欢伯纳黛特吗
<4-8,Penny>You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?

156
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,760
<4-9,Leonard>我可没说是拉杰  谁说是拉杰了
<4-9,Leonard>I didn't say Raj. Who said Raj?

157
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,920
<4-10,Penny>好了  快说
<4-10,Penny>Okay, give.

158
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,050
<4-10,Penny>你怎么知道的  他自己说的吗
<4-10,Penny>How do you know? Did he tell you?

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,260
<4-12,Penny>-不是  -那是谁说的
<4-12,Penny>- No.  - Well, then who?

160
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,250
<4-13,Leonard>我不能说
<4-13,Leonard>I can't say...

161
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,470
<4-14,Penny>普丽娅告诉你的  真是个小八婆
<4-14,Penny>Priya told you. What a little gossip.

162
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,130
<4-14,Penny>一个女人这么八婆可不好  莱纳德
<4-14,Penny>You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard.

163
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,480
<4-14,Penny>我不是说她坏话  只是个人看法而已
<4-14,Penny>Not judging, just my opinion.

164
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,820
<4-15,Leonard>问题是  要是这件事传开了
<4-15,Leonard>Well, The point is, if this got out,

165
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,200
<4-15,Leonard>可能会影响霍华德和拉杰的友谊
<4-15,Leonard>it would destroy Howard and Raj's friendship.

166
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,270
<4-16,Penny>你用不着担心
<4-16,Penny>You don't have to worry.

167
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,350
<4-16,Penny>我又不像艾米和普丽娅  我嘴可严呢
<4-16,Penny>Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.

168
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,650
<4-17,Leonard>这件事一开始就是你告诉艾米的
<4-17,Leonard>You're the one who told Amy in the first place.

169
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,900
<4-18,Penny>我有叫她保密呀
<4-18,Penny>In confidence.

170
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,820
<5-1,Raj>你好  妈妈  你好  爸爸  你们好吗
<5-1,Raj>Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?

<5-2,Mrs Koothrappali (on webcam)>We're very rich in a very poor country.

172
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,460
<5-2,Mrs Koothrappali (on webcam)>所以  总的来说  没啥好抱怨的
<5-2,Mrs Koothrappali (on webcam)>So, all in all, can't complain.

173
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,110
<5-3,Dr Koothrappali>普丽娅
<5-3,Dr Koothrappali>So, Priya,

176
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,680
<5-4,Priya>留在洛杉矶的话
<5-4,Priya>in Los Angeles much longer,

177
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,600
<5-4,Priya>我想我应该找个地方自己搬出去住
<5-4,Priya>I think I should get my own place.

178
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,470
<5-4,Priya>为什么
<5-4,Priya>Why?

179
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,720
<5-5,Mrs Koothrappali>拉杰没给你提供舒适的环境吗
<5-5,Mrs Koothrappali>Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable?

180
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,550
<5-5,Mrs Koothrappali>拉杰  你为什么不给你妹妹提供舒适的环境
<5-5,Mrs Koothrappali>Rajesh, why aren't you making your sister comfortable?

<5-7,Dr Koothrappali>Where are you sleeping, Priya?

186
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,720
<5-8,Priya>这只是修辞说法而已  爸
<5-8,Priya>It's a figure of speech, Daddy.

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,960
<5-8,Priya>意思是说我工作到很晚
<5-8,Priya>It means I-I work late.

188

<5-9,Mrs Koothrappali>别说你交了个美国男朋友
<5-9,Mrs Koothrappali>Please tell me you're not dating an American.

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,580
<5-9,Mrs Koothrappali>我就知道会这样

<5-10,Dr Koothrappali>找霍华德也不错呀
<5-10,Dr Koothrappali>that's not a bad way to go.

<5-10,Dr Koothrappali>他是犹太人
<5-10,Dr Koothrappali>He's Jewish.

<5-11,Raj>这都不重要啦  霍华德有女朋友的
<5-11,Raj>It-It doesn't matter. Howard has a girlfriend.

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,240
<5-13,Raj>-那只是目前而已  -这是什么意思
<5-13,Raj>- For now.  - What does that mean?

<6-11,Leonard>Whatever it is, we're here for you.

232
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,150
<6-11,Leonard>你尽管畅所欲言
<6-11,Leonard>You can tell us anything.

233
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,500
<6-12,Raj>对  不管是好事或悲剧
<6-12,Raj>Yeah. Good or devastating.

234
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,750
<6-13,Howard>我想求她嫁给我
<6-13,Howard>I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

235
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,760
<6-14,Leonard>-嫁给你  -什么
<6-14,Leonard>- Marry you? - What?

236
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,590
<6-16,Howard>我只想找个好时机求婚
<6-16,Howard>I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.

237
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,400
<6-18,Raj>-还是等等吧  -别急  别急
<6-18,Raj>- Oh, I'd wait.  - No rush, no rush.

238
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,230
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>太好了  是我表弟问我婚戒的事
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>Oh, great. It's my cousin David about the ring.

239
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,880
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>大卫  找得怎样
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>Hey, David, what'd you find?

240
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,690
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>没问题  半克拉就行
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>Sure, a half a caret's fine.

241
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,350
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>她那奇小的手  衬得啥都很大
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>Her freakishly small hands make anything look big.

242
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,650
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>这就是我爱她的其中一个理由
<6-19,Howard (phone rings)>It's one of the reasons I love her.

243
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,310
<6-20,Leonard>天  他会大失所望的
<6-20,Leonard>Man, he's going to be blindsided.

244
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,820
<6-21,Raj>我知道  绝对会很糟
<6-21,Raj>I know. It'll be awful.

245
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,470
<6-22,Sheldon>你为什么在笑
<6-22,Sheldon>Why are you smiling?

246
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,530
<6-23,Leonard>对  拉杰  为什么
<6-23,Leonard>Yeah, Raj, why?

247
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,580
<6-24,Raj>在我们印度  笑容有不一样含义
<6-24,Raj>Uh, a smile means something different in my country.

248
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,150
<6-24,Raj>比如高兴的泪水  悲哀的微笑
<6-24,Raj>You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness.

249
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,850
<6-24,Raj>印度是个傻地方
<6-24,Raj>India's a goofy place.

250
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,040
<6-25,Sheldon>哦  我又重新开始想火车了
<6-25,Sheldon>Oh, I'm back to trains.

251
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,400
<7-1,Amy>我有没告诉过你  我们实验室得到一笔拨款进行一项研究
<7-1,Amy>Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?

252
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,380
<7-3,Amy>-没有  -很赞的工作
<7-3,Amy>- No. - Fascinating work.

253
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,490
<7-3,Amy>我最近训练出一僧帽猴抽烟
<7-3,Amy>I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.

254
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,020
<7-4,Sheldon>研究到什么了吗
<7-4,Sheldon>Have you learned anything?

255
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,070
<7-5,Amy>有  它比不抽烟的猴子酷多了
<7-5,Amy>Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys.

256
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,180
<7-5,Amy>当然这也不算项比赛
<7-5,Amy>Although it's not much of a contest.

257
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,090
<7-5,Amy>其他猴子光会闲坐着手淫
<7-5,Amy>The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.

258
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,270
<7-6,Sheldon>你不介意的话
<7-6,Sheldon>If you don't mind,

259
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,640
<7-6,Sheldon>我想停止听你说话  开始发言
<7-6,Sheldon>I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.

260
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,220
<7-7,Amy>当然
<7-7,Amy>By all means.

261
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,100
<7-8,Sheldon>霍华德刚宣布
<7-8,Sheldon>Howard has announced his intention

262
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,850
<7-8,Sheldon>他想向伯纳黛特求婚
<7-8,Sheldon>to propose marriage to Bernadette.

263
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,120
<7-9,Amy>我不明白
<7-9,Amy>I don't understand.

264
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,210
<7-9,Amy>八卦一开始不是说他们要分手吗
<7-9,Amy>The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.

265
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:32,970
<7-9,Amy>就是说啊
<7-9,Amy>I know.

266
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,240
<7-10,Sheldon>我们一致认为他的求婚
<7-10,Sheldon>The group consensus is that his proposal

267
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,250
<7-10,Sheldon>将遭到让他丢脸心碎的拒绝
<7-10,Sheldon>will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection.

268
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,700
<7-10,Sheldon>大家的心情都紧张得要命
<7-10,Sheldon>Everyone was set a-twitter.

269
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,490
<7-10,Sheldon>虽然很奇怪  却没人发微薄
<7-10,Sheldon>Although oddly, no one tweeted.

270
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,790
<7-11,Amy>我并不奇怪这个故事
<7-11,Amy>It's not surprising that the story

271
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,110
<7-11,Amy>已得到我们小小朋友圈里人的注意
<7-11,Amy>has captured the attention of our little circle of friends.

272
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,110
<7-11,Amy>你了解模因理论吗
<7-11,Amy>Are you familiar with Meme Theory?

273
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,540
<7-12,Sheldon>我什么不了解啊  但继续
<7-12,Sheldon>I'm familiar with everything, but go on.

274
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,290
<7-13,Amy>模因理论认为
<7-13,Amy>Meme Theory suggests that

275
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,220
<7-13,Amy>八卦内容就像生物
<7-13,Amy>items of gossip are like living things

276
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,420
<7-13,Amy>力图利用人类作宿主迅速繁殖
<7-13,Amy>that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.

277
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,360
<7-14,Sheldon>我很清楚模因传染病学
<7-14,Sheldon>I'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology.

278
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,220
<7-14,Sheldon>在我就读的约翰逊小学
<7-14,Sheldon>At Johnson Elementary School,

279
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,840
<7-14,Sheldon>"谢耳朵是坨臭耳屎"这话就传播迅猛
<7-14,Sheldon>the phrase "Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

280
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,180
<7-15,Amy>我想也是
<7-15,Amy>I should think so.

281
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,050
<7-15,Amy>这句话真是绝了
<7-15,Amy>That's gold.

282
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,770
<7-16,Sheldon>模因假设并不吸引我
<7-16,Sheldon>Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me.

283
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,480
<7-16,Sheldon>不如我们更近地检测下
<7-16,Sheldon>How might we examine this more closely?

284
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,040
<7-17,Amy>想用人类作实验  你一点都不觉得内疚吗
<7-17,Amy>Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?

285
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,170
<7-18,Sheldon>这是极少几项跟人类相互交往
<7-18,Sheldon>It's one of the few forms of interaction with people

286
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,120
<7-18,Sheldon>不让我讨厌的
<7-18,Sheldon>that I don't find repellent.

287
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,460
<7-19,Amy>我们需要假造一则诱人的八卦
<7-19,Amy>We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.

288
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,940
<7-20,Sheldon>再造一则不诱人的八卦作为实验的控制组
<7-20,Sheldon>And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.

289
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,050
<7-21,Amy>然后追踪它在我们社交圈的发展情况
<7-21,Amy>Then we'll track its progress through our social group

290
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,620
<7-21,Amy>通过几项相互矛盾的理论来解释结果
<7-21,Amy>and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms

291
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,540
<7-21,Amy>如模因理论  代数八卦和传染病学
<7-21,Amy>of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.

292
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,550
<7-22,Sheldon>看看你  居然让我开始研究社会科学了
<7-22,Sheldon>Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences.

293
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,650
<7-22,Sheldon>你真坏  艾米·费拉·福勒
<7-22,Sheldon>You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.

294
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,410
<8-1,Penny>嘿  艾米  有事吗
<8-1,Penny>Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

295
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,260
<8-2,Amy>我和谢尔顿上床了
<8-2,Amy>Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse.

296
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,160
<8-2,Amy>还有  我想种个百草园
<8-2,Amy>In other news, I'm thinking of starting an herb garden.

297
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,320
<8-2,Amy>要保密哦  我走了
<8-2,Amy>Mum's the word. Gotta go.

298
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,020
<8-2,Amy>拉杰  你在这干嘛
<8-2,Amy>Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?

299
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,690
<9-1,Bernadette>就想一个人喝喝酒
<9-1,Bernadette>I just felt like drinking alone,

300
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,430
<9-2,Raj>因为我深沉黑暗
<9-2,Raj>because I'm deep and dark.

301
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,410
<9-3,Bernadette>霍华德没来吗
<9-3,Bernadette>So, uh, Howard's not here?

302
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,830
<9-4,Raj>没  又是只有我和你了
<9-4,Raj>No. It's just one of those times when it's just you and me.

303
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,380
<9-4,Raj>就像上次我们仨去看电影
<9-4,Raj>Like when the three of us went to the movies,

304
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,980
<9-4,Raj>因为红蔓卷绳糖和樱桃可乐
<9-4,Raj>and you and I waited outside the bathroom

305
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,230
<9-4,Raj>霍华德躲在厕所里吐  咱俩就在外面等着
<9-4,Raj>while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke.

306
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,200
<9-4,Raj>你还记得吗
<9-4,Raj>Do you remember that?

307
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,020
<9-5,Bernadette>记得
<9-5,Bernadette>Yeah.

308
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,280
<9-6,Raj>我也是

309
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,890
<9-6,Raj>真是美好时光
<9-6,Raj>Good times.

310
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,180
<9-7,Penny>16桌要点头盘
<9-7,Penny>16 wants to order appetizers.

311
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,690
<9-9,Raj>-谢谢  -刚才的时光也很美好
<9-9,Raj>- Oh, thanks. - This was nice.

312
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,110
<9-10,Penny>你到底在这干嘛
<9-10,Penny>What the hell are you doing?

313
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,370
<9-10,Penny>霍华德是你最好的朋友  而那是他女友
<9-10,Penny>Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend.

314
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,970
<9-10,Penny>你真该为自己感到羞耻
<9-10,Penny>You should be ashamed of yourself.

315
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,070
<9-11,Raj>我来的时候的确是
<9-11,Raj>I was when I came in,

316
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,760
<9-11,Raj>但美酒穿肠过  美人心中留
<9-11,Raj>but it's amazing what liquor does to guilt.

317
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
<9-11,Raj>还有你可能不知道
<9-11,Raj>Besides what you might not know

318
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,510
<9-11,Raj>伯纳黛特正准备跟霍华德分手呢
<9-11,Raj>is Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.

319
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,010
<9-12,Penny>我知道  你又怎么知道的
<9-12,Penny>Well, I know that. How do you know that?

320
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,980
<9-13,Raj>我妹妹说的
<9-13,Raj>My sister told me.

321
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,050
<9-14,Penny>那个八卦的婊子
<9-14,Penny>Oh, that gossipy bitch.

322
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,340
<9-14,Penny>无意冒犯
<9-14,Penny>No offense.

323
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,020
<9-15,Raj>我不介意
<9-15,Raj>None taken.

324
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,050
<9-15,Raj>你真该听听她背后怎么说你的
<9-15,Raj>You should hear how she talks about you.

325
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,090
<9-16,Penny>好吧  听着
<9-16,Penny>Okay, listen,

326
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,130
<9-16,Penny>就算霍华德和贝纳黛特之间出了问题
<9-16,Penny>just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems,

327
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,230
<9-16,Penny>你也不应该在这四处打探
<9-16,Penny>does not mean you should be here sniffing around.

328
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,140
<9-17,Raj>我能怎么办  我脑子里想的都是她
<9-17,Raj>What can I do? I can't stop thinking about her.

329
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,260
<9-18,Penny>好吧  试着想想这个
<9-18,Penny>All right, try thinking about this--

330
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,800
<9-18,Penny>谢尔顿和艾米上床啦
<9-18,Penny>Sheldon and Amy had sex.

331
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,600
<9-19,Raj>闭上你的狗嘴
<9-19,Raj>Shut your ass!

332
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,890
<9-20,Penny>是真的  艾米亲口跟我说的
<9-20,Penny>Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.

333
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,390
<9-21,Raj>怎么可能发生这事呢
<9-21,Raj>How did that even happen?

334
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,170
<9-21,Raj>他们干的时候
<9-21,Raj>Did they know that's what they were doing

335
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,820
<9-21,Raj>知道自己在干嘛吗
<9-21,Raj>when they were doing it?

336
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,420
<9-22,Penny>我猜他们应该是灵机一动  于是激情喷涌
<9-22,Penny>I-I guess they just figurd it out at some point.

337
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,050
<9-23,Raj>真不敢相信老处男臭耳屎终于开苞了
<9-23,Raj>I can't believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.

338
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,810
<10-2,Sheldon>希望你饿了
<10-2,Sheldon>Hope you're hungry.

339
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,420
<10-3,Leonard>有意思
<10-3,Leonard>Interesting.

340
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,070
<10-4,Sheldon>这个国家表示友好的方式
<10-4,Sheldon>A friendly sentiment in this country,

341
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,690
<10-4,Sheldon>在苏丹却是残酷的奚落
<10-4,Sheldon>cruel taunt in the Sudan.

342
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,710
<10-4,Sheldon>不同语境的教训啊
<10-4,Sheldon>It's a lesson in context.

343
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,900
<10-5,Leonard>艾米会来跟咱们一起吃饭吗
<10-5,Leonard>Will Amy be joining us for dinner?

344
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,340
<10-6,Sheldon>应该会来吧
<10-6,Sheldon>Yes, I believe so.

345
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,010
<10-7,Leonard>好  很好

<10-7,Leonard>你们俩  还好吧
<10-7,Leonard>Everything... okay between you two?

347
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,660
<10-7,Leonard>当然
<10-7,Leonard>Yes.

348
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,590
<10-8,Sheldon>你问这个干嘛
<10-8,Sheldon>Why do you ask?

349
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,900
<10-9,Leonard>没事随便问问
<10-9,Leonard>No reason.

350
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,140
<10-9,Leonard>我刚跟拉杰聊天
<10-9,Leonard>I was just talking to Raj,

351
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,670
<10-9,Leonard>他觉得艾米这几天容光焕发得不得了
<10-9,Leonard>and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.

352
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,550
<10-10,Sheldon>他是说那种容光是因为照料百草园时
<10-10,Sheldon>Did he mean as if she'd been out in the sun,

353
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,160
<10-10,Sheldon>没戴帽子或擦防晒  而被太阳晒成的吗
<10-10,Sheldon>tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?

354
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,210
<10-10,Sheldon>不是
<10-10,Sheldon>No.

355
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,490
<10-11,Leonard>他说的重点不是这个
<10-11,Leonard>That's not what he meant.

356
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,680
<10-12,Sheldon>那我们就不得而知了
<10-12,Sheldon>Well, we may never know.

357
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,920
<10-12,Sheldon>正如我母亲常说
<10-12,Sheldon>As my mother would say,

358
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,040
<10-12,Sheldon>亚洲人高深莫测呀
<10-12,Sheldon>the Asians are an inscrutable folk.

359
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,490
<10-12,Sheldon>不好意思  我还有工作要忙
<10-12,Sheldon>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

360
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,740
<10-13,Leonard>你忙你忙
<10-13,Leonard>Yeah, you do.

361
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,430
<10-13,Leonard>小坏蛋  装毛呀装
<10-13,Leonard>You dog, you.

362
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,510
<10-14,Sheldon>你听见了吗
<10-14,Sheldon>Did you get that?

363
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,820
<10-15,Amy (on webcam)>一字不差
<10-15,Amy (on webcam)>Every word.

364
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,840
<10-15,Amy (on webcam)>我们谣言八卦模因
<10-15,Amy (on webcam)>Our false gossip meme

365
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,830
<10-15,Amy (on webcam)>好像已经到达目录树中的节点表达式了
<10-15,Amy (on webcam)>appears to have reached node lambda.

366
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,680
<10-16,Sheldon>传递得比我们想象中要快
<10-16,Sheldon>This is moving faster than we thought.

367
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,400
<10-17,Amy>同意
<10-17,Amy>Agreed.

368
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,050
<10-17,Amy>似乎谣言的传播速率
<10-17,Amy>It appears the rate of gossip transmission

369
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,100
<10-17,Amy>与节点数量的二次幂成比例
<10-17,Amy>is proportional to the number of nodes squared.

370
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,180
<10-18,Sheldon>艾米  我不得不说
<10-18,Sheldon>I must say, Amy,

371
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,830
<10-18,Sheldon>假装跟你上床
<10-18,Sheldon>pretending to have intercourse with you

372
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,610
<10-18,Sheldon>让我的身心得到了极大的满足
<10-18,Sheldon>is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.

373
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,130
<10-19,Amy>慢点  谢尔顿  我还没啥感觉呢
<10-19,Amy>Slow down, Sheldon. I'm not quite there yet.

374
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,340
<11-1,Leonard>-帮我递下酱油  -好的
<11-1,Leonard>- Pass the soy sauce. - sure

375
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,740
<11-3,Amy>贝纳黛特刚向我打听咱俩上床的事
<11-3,Amy>Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you.

376
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,140
<11-3,Amy>模因全面插入[penetration也有阴茎插入的意思]
<11-3,Amy>The meme has reached full penetration.

377
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,180
<11-4,Sheldon>故意用的双关语吗
<11-4,Sheldon>Pun intended?

378
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,170
<11-5,Amy>不是  无心插柳柳成荫
<11-5,Amy>No. Happy accident.

379
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,850
<11-6,Sheldon>这次成果显著
<11-6,Sheldon>This is remarkable.

380
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,690
<11-6,Sheldon>还不到24小时
<11-6,Sheldon>Took less than 24 hours.

381
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,590
<11-7,Amy>我应该告诉你
<11-7,Amy>I should let you know

382
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,660
<11-7,Amy>她还问了咱俩调情的细节
<11-7,Amy>that she asked for details about our dalliance.

383
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,910
<11-7,Amy>真有意思
<11-7,Amy>Interesting.

384
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,290
<11-8,Sheldon>人们开始不满足于"上床"的字面意思
<11-8,Sheldon>So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus

385
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,920
<11-8,Sheldon>发展到要咱俩"越吹越爽"的细节了
<11-8,Sheldon>to a "blow by blow," as it were.

386
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,800
<11-9,Amy>故意用的双关语吗
<11-9,Amy>Pun intended?

387
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,860
<11-10,Sheldon>抱歉  什么双关
<11-10,Sheldon>I'm sorry. What pun?

388
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,790
<11-11,Amy>不说这个了
<11-11,Amy>Not important.

389
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,420
<11-11,Amy>我把你的做爱方式概括为"冷淡却高效"
<11-11,Amy>I described your lovemaking as "aloof, but effective."

390
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,550
<11-12,Sheldon>但愿你没有说出口
<11-12,Sheldon>I wish you hadn't done that.

391
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,050
<11-12,Sheldon>这话说得我跟一个少妇杀手一样
<11-12,Sheldon>That's going to make me a chick magnet,

392
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,200
<11-12,Sheldon>而事实上  我非常忙
<11-12,Sheldon>and I'm so busy as it is.

393
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,520
<11-13,Howard>大家注意啦
<11-13,Howard>Hey, everybody,

394
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,160
<11-13,Howard>我有话要问贝纳黛特
<11-13,Howard>I got something I want to ask Bernadette,

395
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,220
<11-13,Howard>现在大伙儿齐聚一堂
<11-13,Howard>and I can't think of a better time

396
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,970
<11-13,Howard>天时地利人和都最佳的时候
<11-13,Howard>than when I'm with all my friends.

397
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,310
<11-14,Leonard>慢着  霍华德
<11-14,Leonard>Oh, hold on, Howard.

398
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,660
<11-14,Leonard>还有更多天时更好的
<11-14,Leonard>There's lots of better times.

399
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,290
<11-15,Raj>莱纳德  拜托  他说话呢
<11-15,Raj>Leonard, please. The man is talking.

400
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,260
<11-15,Raj>让他说出来  别管后果如何
<11-15,Raj>Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.

401
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,210
<11-15,Raj>谢谢
<11-15,Raj>Thank you.

402
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,870
<11-16,Howard>贝纳黛特·玛丽安·罗森考斯基
<11-16,Howard>Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

403
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,590
<11-17,Bernadette>天啊  这是什么回事
<11-17,Bernadette>Oh, God. What's happening?

404
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,440
<11-18,Howard>我知道我们的爱情不算完美
<11-18,Howard>I know things haven't been perfect with us,

405
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,990
<11-18,Howard>而且遇到了问题
<11-18,Howard>and we've had our problems,

406
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,940
<11-18,Howard>但我不得不告诉你  从我遇见你那刻
<11-18,Howard>but I just have to tell you, from the moment I...

407
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,900
<11-19,Bernadette>霍华德  你先别说
<11-19,Bernadette>Howard, let me just stop you right here.

408
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,390
<11-20,Raj>好戏上场
<11-20,Raj>This is it.

409
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,090
<11-21,Bernadette>我愿意
<11-21,Bernadette>Yes.

410
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
<11-22,Howard>你愿意什么
<11-22,Howard>Yes, what?

411
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,870
<11-23,Bernadette>我愿意嫁给你
<11-23,Bernadette>Yes, I will marry you.

412
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,240
<11-24,Howard>-你愿意?  - 你愿意?!
<11-24,Howard>- You will? - You will?

413
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,660
<11-26,Bernadette>我愿意!

414

<11-30,Priya>这太激动人心了
<11-30,Priya>Oh, it's so exciting.

420
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,210
<11-31,Amy>我真纳闷她为什么改变主意
<11-31,Amy>I wonder what changed her mind.

421
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,300
<11-32,Sheldon>或许是因为你对我非凡性能力的谈论
<11-32,Sheldon>Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess

422
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,320
<11-32,Sheldon>重燃了她对爱情的信心
<11-32,Sheldon>renewed her faith in love.

423
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,530
<11-33,Amy>没有比这更好的解释了
<11-33,Amy>As good an explanation as any.

424
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,530
<11-34,Leonard>你戴着真漂亮
<11-34,Leonard>That's great...

425
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,330
<11-34,Leonard>嘿  艾米
<11-34,Leonard>Oh, hey, Amy.

426
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,430
<12-1,Penny>伯纳黛特刚发短信给我
<12-1,Penny>Bernadette just texted me.

427
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,860
<12-1,Penny>霍华德求婚了
<12-1,Penny>Howard proposed?

428
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,580
<12-2,Amy>对  这个不重要  我只是路过
<12-2,Amy>Yes, not important. Just stopped by

429
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,150
<12-2,Amy>顺便告诉你一声  我准备做矫正术
<12-2,Amy>to let you know I'm getting orthotics.

430
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,860
<12-2,Amy>对了  我怀了谢尔顿的孩子
<12-2,Amy>Also, I'm carrying Sheldon's baby.

<12-2,Amy>哇哦  还有提到矫正术吗
<12-2,Amy>Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
