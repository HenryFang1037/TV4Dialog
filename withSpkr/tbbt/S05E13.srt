1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,140
<1-1,Leonard>晚饭想不想换个花样
<1-1,Leonard>You feel like trying something new for dinner?

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,690
<1-1,Leonard>德墨菜  德州式墨西哥菜
<1-1,Leonard>美国的德克萨斯州和墨西哥接壤

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,420
<1-1,Leonard>要不试试印度菜或者德墨菜
<1-1,Leonard>Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,750
<1-2,Sheldon>你有没有好奇过  如果人类是从蜥蜴
<1-2,Sheldon>You ever wonder how humans would be different

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,860
<1-2,Sheldon>而不是哺乳动物进化而来  会有啥区别
<1-2,Sheldon>if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,130
<1-3,Leonard>好吧  你说吧
<1-3,Leonard>Okay, let's talk about that.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,160
<1-4,Sheldon>你也知道  蜥蜴这种冷血动物
<1-4,Sheldon>As you know, lizards-- cold-blooded animals--

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,400
<1-4,Sheldon>缺乏感知温度的能力
<1-4,Sheldon>lack the ability to sense temperature.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,360
<1-4,Sheldon>但它们确实在低温环境下行动更迟缓
<1-4,Sheldon>But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,970
<1-4,Sheldon>所以呢  蜥蜴天气预报员会这么说话
<1-4,Sheldon>So, lizard weathermen would say things like,

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,720
<1-4,Sheldon>"带上件毛衣  外面好慢[冷]"
<1-4,Sheldon>"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside."

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,140
<1-4,Sheldon>我爱死自己的犀利头脑了
<1-4,Sheldon>I love my mind.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,780
<1-5,Leonard>我们也是
<1-5,Leonard>We all do.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,220
<1-5,Leonard>快说  晚饭吃啥
<1-5,Leonard>Now, how about dinner?

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,430
<1-5,Leonard>大多数蜥蜴吃动物性食物  主要是各种昆虫
<1-5,Leonard>体型较大的蜥蜴会以其他蜥蜴为食物

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,430
<1-6,Sheldon>我猜我们会享受吃昆虫和小蜥蜴的盛宴
<1-6,Sheldon>Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards.

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,150
<1-6,Sheldon>我们也可以扯掉对方的尾巴然后烤着吃
<1-6,Sheldon>We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them;

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,780
<1-6,Sheldon>反正还能再长回来
<1-6,Sheldon>they'll just grow back.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,700
<1-6,Sheldon>我的真人大小的卡纸板史波克先生到了
<1-6,Sheldon>My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here!

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,740
<1-6,Sheldon>我知道他不喜欢常人情感的瞬间流露
<1-6,Sheldon>I know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion,

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,490
<1-6,Sheldon>可是  好棒哦  好棒哦  好棒哦
<1-6,Sheldon>but, oh, goodie, oh, goodie, oh, goodie.

23
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,960
<1-6,Sheldon>史波克中校请求拆封
<1-6,Sheldon>Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.

24
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,350
<1-7,Leonard (seeing Penny’s door open and the girls inside)>失陪一下
<1-7,Leonard (seeing Penny’s door open and the girls inside)>Excuse me.

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,160
<1-8,Sheldon>允许拆封  中校
<1-8,Sheldon>Permission granted, Commander.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,920
<1-9,Amy>这就是为什么越聪明的猴子
<1-9,Amy>Which is why the more intelligent the monkey,

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,390
<1-9,Amy>就越喜欢扔大便
<1-9,Amy>the more feces they fling.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,150
<1-10,Leonard>打断一下  艾米
<1-10,Leonard>Excuse me, Amy.

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,030
<1-10,Leonard>佩妮  你今天的晚饭有安排吗
<1-10,Leonard>Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?

30
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,230
<1-11,Penny>怎么了  你们要去什么好地方吗
<1-11,Penny>Why, you guys going somewhere?

31
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,560
<1-12,Leonard>不是  就咱俩单独吃
<1-12,Leonard>No, I mean just you and me.

32
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,810
<1-13,Penny>像约会那样吗
<1-13,Penny>You mean, like a date?

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,420
<1-14,Leonard>不是约会的那种约会
<1-14,Leonard>Not like a date, a date.

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,090
<1-16,Bernadette>呃  好吧
<1-16,Bernadette>Um... o-okay.

35
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,180
<1-17,Penny>行啊
<1-17,Penny>Sure.

36
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,600
<1-19,Bernadette>天啊
<1-19,Bernadette>Oh, no!

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,880
<1-20,Sheldon>这不是我要的史波克
<1-20,Sheldon>They sent the wrong Spock!

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,780
<1-20,Sheldon>生生不息  早日去死  扎克瑞·昆图
<1-20,Sheldon>Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.

49
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,720
<2-1,Bernadette>太好了
<2-1,Bernadette>This is so exciting.

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,470
<2-1,Bernadette>要是莱纳德和佩妮复合了
<2-1,Bernadette>If Leonard and Penny get back together,

51
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,700
<2-1,Bernadette>我和霍华德就可以跟他们一起四人约会了
<2-1,Bernadette>Howard and I can go on double dates with them.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,990
<2-2,Amy>你怎么从来不邀请谢尔顿和我参加四人约会呢
<2-2,Amy>How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?

53
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,100
<2-3,Bernadette>你衣服试得怎么样了  佩妮
<2-3,Bernadette>How's it going in there, Penny?!

54
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,730
<2-4,Penny>稍等片刻
<2-4,Penny>Just a sec.

55
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,350
<2-4,Penny>是不是太隆重了
<2-4,Penny>Too much?

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,210
<2-5,Bernadette>-确实  -才没有
<2-5,Bernadette>- Yes. - No.

57
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,080
<2-7,Penny>好吧  再等一下
<2-7,Penny>Okay, just hang on.

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,490
<2-8,Amy>你受不了她那股天生的骚劲  对吧
<2-8,Amy>You just can't handle her raw sexuality, can you?

59
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,440
<2-9,Bernadette>你和莱纳德是什么时候分手的
<2-9,Bernadette>When did you and Leonard break up?

60
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,730
<2-10,Penny>差不多两年前吧
<2-10,Penny>Uh, about two years ago.

61
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,850
<2-11,Bernadette>你觉得他约你吃饭的原因是什么
<2-11,Bernadette>Why do you think he asked you out again?

62
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,530
<2-12,Penny>不知道
<2-12,Penny>I don't know.

63
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,700
<2-13,Amy>也许是他命不久矣
<2-13,Amy>Maybe he's dying.

64
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,300
<2-13,Amy>那该有多浪漫啊
<2-13,Amy>That would be so romantic.

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,190
<2-14,Penny>他命长着呢
<2-14,Penny>He's not dying.

66
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,450
<2-15,Amy>真可惜
<2-15,Amy>Too bad.

67
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,500
<2-15,Amy>如果是的话  她就可以把莱纳德推到在床
<2-15,Amy>If he were, she could just throw him in bed

68
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,790
<2-15,Amy>骑在他身上尽性  直到他心跳停止
<2-15,Amy>and ride him right up until he flatlines.

69
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,730
<2-16,Penny>这件怎么样
<2-16,Penny>How about this?

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,470
<2-18,Amy>-还行  -拜托
<2-18,Amy>- Maybe. - Come on.

71
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,560
<2-19,Penny>好吧  这件不行
<2-19,Penny>Yeah, okay, no.

72
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,380
<2-20,Bernadette>你觉得你今晚会和他上床吗
<2-20,Bernadette>Do you think you'll sleep with him tonight?

73
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,440
<2-21,Penny>绝对不会
<2-21,Penny>Absolutely not.

74
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,720
<2-21,Penny>我们就是吃个饭
<2-21,Penny>Look, we're just gonna have dinner

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,700
<2-21,Penny>然后再看情况吧
<2-21,Penny>and, you know, see how it goes.

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,370
<2-22,Amy>如果他病入膏肓了  你会和他上床吗
<2-22,Amy>If he were dying, would you sleep with him?

77
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,390
<2-23,Penny>什么
<2-23,Penny>What?!

78
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,970
<2-24,Amy>假设他身患绝症
<2-24,Amy>Assuming he were dying of something

79
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,090
<2-24,Amy>而这种病不会通过性行为传播
<2-24,Amy>that couldn't be sexually transmitted.

80
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,380
<2-24,Amy>比如脑袋上的箭伤
<2-24,Amy>You know, like a spear wound to the head.

81
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,020
<2-25,Penny>够了  他的命长着呢
<2-25,Penny>Okay, he is not dying.

82
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,100
<2-26,Amy>你怎么知道  你是医生吗
<2-26,Amy>How do you know? Are you a doctor?

83
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,870
<2-27,Bernadette>不过你可以这么幻想嘛
<2-27,Bernadette>You can make-believe, though.

84
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,920
<2-27,Bernadette>有时候霍华德和我会假装他出现了心律失常
<2-27,Bernadette>Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up

85
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,030
<2-27,Bernadette>而我是一个性感的心脏病医生
<2-27,Bernadette>and I'm a sexy cardiologist.

86
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,430
<2-27,Bernadette>最好玩的部分是  我的护理服务可是不收费的哟
<2-27,Bernadette>And the naughty part is I'm not in his HMO network.

87
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,510
<2-28,Penny>算了  我不打算搞得好得多大件事
<2-28,Penny>Screw it. I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this.

88
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,910
<2-28,Penny>就是吃个晚饭嘛
<2-28,Penny>It's just dinner.

89
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,270
<2-29,Amy>跟死人一起吃
<2-29,Amy>With a dead man.

90
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,570
<2-30,Penny>艾米  别说了
<2-30,Penny>Amy, stop it.

91
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,360
<2-30,Penny>天啊  我好紧张
<2-30,Penny>Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
<2-31,Bernadette>放松啦
<2-31,Bernadette>Relax.

93
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,160
<2-31,Bernadette>你知道莱纳德一直都很喜欢你
<2-31,Bernadette>You know Leonard's always been crazy about you.

94
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,340
<2-31,Bernadette>不会有事的
<2-31,Bernadette>It's gonna be great.

95
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,790
<2-32,Penny>我知道  可是我们好不容易才到了
<2-32,Penny>I know, but we've finally gotten to a place

96
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,620
<2-32,Penny>见面聊天都不尴尬的地步
<2-32,Penny>where we can hang out without it being weird.

97
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,680
<2-32,Penny>万一出了什么岔子呢  然后怎么办
<2-32,Penny>And what if something goes wrong? Then what?

98
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,210
<2-33,Amy>我猜只有谢尔顿和我
<2-33,Amy>Guess it'll just be Sheldon and me

99
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,550
<2-33,Amy>去陪霍华德和伯纳黛特一起四人约会了
<2-33,Amy>going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.

100
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,820
<2-34,Bernadette>是啊  我们好期待
<2-34,Bernadette>Sure, we'd love that.

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,680
<2-34,Bernadette>快换衣服  我俩可就指望你俩今晚的表现了
<2-34,Bernadette>Change your clothes; we got a lot riding on this.

102
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,950
<3-1,Sheldon>我想修条路
<3-1,Sheldon>I want to build a road,

104
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,450
<3-1,Sheldon>但我需要硬木
<3-1,Sheldon>but I need wood.

105
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,840
<3-1,Sheldon>你俩谁有硬木吗
<3-1,Sheldon>Do either of you fellows have wood?

106
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,970
<3-1,Sheldon>我不知道你们在笑什么
<3-1,Sheldon>I don't understand the laughter.

107
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,650
<3-1,Sheldon>《卡坦岛》的目标
<3-1,Sheldon>The object of Settlers of Catan

108
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,610
<3-1,Sheldon>就是修建道路和房屋
<3-1,Sheldon>is to build roads and settlements.

109
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,130
<3-1,Sheldon>所以需要硬木
<3-1,Sheldon>To do so requires wood.

111
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,530
<3-1,Sheldon>我现在有绵羊  缺硬木
<3-1,Sheldon>Now, I have sheep; I need wood.

112
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,820
<3-1,Sheldon>谁能拿硬木换我的绵羊
<3-1,Sheldon>Who has wood for my sheep?

113
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,320
<3-2,Leonard>我这身看着怎么样
<3-2,Leonard>Okay, how do I look?

114
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,990
<3-3,Howard>我更想知道  你为什么要这么做
<3-3,Howard>More to the point, why are you doing this?

115
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,830
<3-4,Leonard>你在说什么
<3-4,Leonard>What are you talking about?

116
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,370
<3-5,Raj>你忘了佩妮当初怎么对你的吗
<3-5,Raj>Did you forget what Penny did to you?

117
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,530
<3-5,Raj>你花了两年的时间  还玷污了我妹妹
<3-5,Raj>It took you two years and defiling my sister

118
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,540
<3-5,Raj>才把你的愁云惨淡换成嬉皮笑脸
<3-5,Raj>to turn that frown upside down.

119
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,710
<3-6,Leonard>我没有玷污你妹妹  我们只是交往过
<3-6,Leonard>I didn't defile your sister,we had a relationship.

121
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,980
<3-7,Raj>我以前听你叫她"靓妹黑妞"呢
<3-7,Raj>I heard you call her Brown Sugar.

122
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,190
<3-7,Raj>在我看来  这就是玷污
<3-7,Raj>In my book, that's defilement.

123
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,200
<3-8,Sheldon>想听听我的意见吗
<3-8,Sheldon>You want to know my opinion?

124
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,420
<3-9,Leonard>天啊  想听得不得了
<3-9,Leonard>Oh, boy, do I!

125
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,320
<3-10,Sheldon>是故意说反话吗
<3-10,Sheldon>Sarcasm?

126
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,010
<3-11,Howard>不是
<3-11,Howard>No.

127
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,810
<3-12,Sheldon>那好吧
<3-12,Sheldon>All right, then.

128
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,330
<3-12,Sheldon>你之所以对佩妮这种
<3-12,Sheldon>The reason you're fixated on

129
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,640
<3-12,Sheldon>秀外痴中的姑娘念念不忘
<3-12,Sheldon>a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that

130
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,510
<3-12,Sheldon>是因为她跟你的第一位爱慕对象截然相反
<3-12,Sheldon>she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment:

131
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,760
<3-12,Sheldon>也就是你害怕的天才母亲
<3-12,Sheldon>your brilliant yet intimidating mother.

132
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,810
<3-13,Leonard>你怎么会有这种想法
<3-13,Leonard>Where on earth did you get that from?

133
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,390
<3-14,Sheldon>她的书《越缺爱的小孩越贪心》里写的
<3-14,Sheldon>It's in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.

134
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,210
<3-15,Leonard>那也不代表就是真的
<3-15,Leonard>That doesn't make it true.

135
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,620
<3-16,Sheldon>莱纳德  那本书可是非虚构类的
<3-16,Sheldon>It's called nonfiction for a reason, Leonard.

136
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,990
<3-17,Leonard>回见
<3-17,Leonard>See you later.

137
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,380
<3-18,Raj>如果有人把她那本书拍成电影
<3-18,Raj>If they ever make a movie version of that book,

138
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,090
<3-18,Raj>你们知道该由谁来扮演莱纳德的妈妈吗
<3-18,Raj>you know who should play Leonard's mother?

140
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,660
<3-18,Raj>桑德拉·布洛克
<3-18,Raj>Sandra Bullock.

141
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,010
<3-19,Howard>为什么
<3-19,Howard>Why?

142
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,250
<3-20,Raj>因为她每部作品都诠释得很好
<3-20,Raj>Because she's great in everything.

143
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,690
<3-21,Sheldon>我们玩到哪儿了
<3-21,Sheldon>Now, where were we?

144
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,300
<3-21,Sheldon>对了  你们谁有硬木吗
<3-21,Sheldon>Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood?

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,120
<3-21,Sheldon>拜托
<3-21,Sheldon>Oh, come on!

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,850
<3-21,Sheldon>人家只是想要硬木而已
<3-21,Sheldon>I just want wood.

147
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,050
<3-21,Sheldon>有必要要搞得这么难[硬]啊
<3-21,Sheldon>Why are you making it so hard?

148
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,580
<4-1,Leonard>有什么词可以形容
<4-1,Leonard>So, do they have a name for a first date

149
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,430
<4-1,Leonard>跟以前相好过的人第一次约会吗
<4-1,Leonard>with someone you used to go out with?

150
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,100
<4-2,Penny>这个问题问得好
<4-2,Penny>Oh, that's a good question.

151
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,020
<4-2,Penny>"尴尬"怎么样
<4-2,Penny>How about "awkward"?

152
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,190
<4-3,Leonard>-这词挺恰当的  -对吧
<4-3,Leonard>- Yeah, that sounds right. - Yeah?

153
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,540
<4-5,Leonard>要不我们假装这真的是第一次约会
<4-5,Leonard>Hey, how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date?

154
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,590
<4-5,Leonard>-看看结果怎么样  -好啊
<4-5,Leonard>- See how that goes. - Okay.

155
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,850
<4-7,Leonard>胖妮  跟我说说你吧
<4-7,Leonard>So, Polly, tell me about yourself.

156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,260
<4-8,Penny>我叫佩妮
<4-8,Penny>It's Penny.

157
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,550
<4-9,Leonard>对不起  真尴尬
<4-9,Leonard>Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.

158
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,770
<4-9,Leonard>没事  我想想
<4-9,Leonard>Okay, uh, let's see.

159
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,050
<4-10,Penny>我来自内布拉斯加  我还很小的时候
<4-10,Penny>I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl,

160
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,040
<4-10,Penny>就梦想着能搬到洛杉矶  成为一名电影明星
<4-10,Penny>I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star.

161
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,980
<4-10,Penny>不过上了四年的表演课
<4-10,Penny>Anyway, after four years of acting lessons

162
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,180
<4-10,Penny>当了四年服务员之后
<4-10,Penny>and waiting tables,

163
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,040
<4-10,Penny>我出演了一个痔疮广告
<4-10,Penny>I've done a hemorrhoid commercial

164
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,020
<4-10,Penny>和一个保龄球球道上面扮演过安妮·弗兰克
<4-10,Penny>and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley.

165
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,800
<4-10,Penny>所以梦想真的能实现的
<4-10,Penny>So, you know, dreams do come true.

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,810
<4-10,Penny>该你了
<4-10,Penny>Your turn.

167
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,220
<4-11,Leonard>我想想
<4-11,Leonard>Uh, let's see.

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,570
<4-11,Leonard>我是加州理工学院的实验物理学家
<4-11,Leonard>Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech,

169
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,740
<4-11,Leonard>大部分研究都跟高功率激光有关
<4-11,Leonard>most of my research is with high-powered lasers,

170
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,510
<4-11,Leonard>我最近刚拿到一大笔政府资助金
<4-11,Leonard>and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant

171
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,240
<4-11,Leonard>看看能不能用于研究
<4-11,Leonard>to see if they can be used to knock out

172
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
<4-11,Leonard>击落来袭的弹道导弹
<4-11,Leonard>incoming ballistic missiles.

173
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,070
<4-12,Penny>哇  那能实现吗
<4-12,Penny>Wow. Can they?

174
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,640
<4-12,Penny>废话  当然不行
<4-12,Penny>Oh, God, no.

175
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,070
<4-13,Leonard>不过看在这么多钱的份上
<4-13,Leonard>The money's pretty good.

176
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,250
<4-13,Leonard>我还用那设备来发射自己的蝙蝠信号[蝙蝠侠中的求救信号]
<4-13,Leonard>And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.

177
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,030
<4-14,Penny>蝙蝠信号
<4-14,Penny>Bat-signal?

178
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,750
<4-14,Penny>怎么  你是所谓的宅男吗
<4-14,Penny>What are you, some kind of nerd?

179
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,670
<4-15,Leonard>不是所谓的宅男  而是宅男之王
<4-15,Leonard>Not some kind of nerd, I'm the king of the nerds.

180
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,750
<4-16,Penny>宅男之王是什么意思
<4-16,Penny>What does that mean?

181
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,660
<4-17,Leonard>意思是谁要是惹恼我了
<4-17,Leonard>Uh, it means if anyone displeases me,

182
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,080
<4-17,Leonard>我就不帮他们装打印机
<4-17,Leonard>I don't help them set up their printer.

183
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,120
<4-18,Penny>-你真幽默  -那就好
<4-18,Penny>- You are so funny. - Good.

184
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,650
<4-19,Leonard>那我脱衣服的时候  你就想着这个优点好了
<4-19,Leonard>Remember that when I take my shirt off.

185
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,540
<4-20,Penny>莱纳德  这样真好
<4-20,Penny>Leonard, this is nice.

186
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,860
<4-20,Penny>我很高兴我们能约会
<4-20,Penny>I'm so glad we did this.

187
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,960
<4-21,Leonard>我也是
<4-21,Leonard>Me, too.

188
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,870
<4-21,Leonard>那你意下如何
<4-21,Leonard>So what do you think?

189
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,500
<4-21,Leonard>我们能复合吗
<4-21,Leonard>Are we gonna get back together?

190
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,170
<4-22,Penny>不用这么快吧
<4-22,Penny>Whoa. Not so fast.

191
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,020
<4-23,Leonard>对不起  我说错什么了吗
<4-23,Leonard>I'm sorry, what did I say?

192
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,770
<4-24,Penny>莱纳德  你知道我对你的感觉永远不会变
<4-24,Penny>Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.

193
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,710
<4-25,Leonard>-老天  -怎么了
<4-25,Leonard>- Oh, God. - What?

194
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,590
<4-27,Leonard>你说了"永远"
<4-27,Leonard>You said "always."

195
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,300
<4-27,Leonard>你对我的感觉永远不会变
<4-27,Leonard>You'll always have feelings for me.

196
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,920
<4-28,Penny>有问题吗
<4-28,Penny>So?

197
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,700
<4-29,Leonard>那听起来更像是在说
<4-29,Leonard>So, that sounds more like something you'd say

198
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,910
<4-29,Leonard>你不想和某人谈恋爱
<4-29,Leonard>if you didn't want a relationship with someone.

199
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,910
<4-29,Leonard>"我们不会有结果的"
<4-29,Leonard>"This isn't working out,"

200
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,910
<4-29,Leonard>"但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
<4-29,Leonard>"but I'll always have feelings for you."

201
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,790
<4-29,Leonard>"对不起  我跟你的好朋友睡了"
<4-29,Leonard>"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend,"

202
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,680
<4-31,Leonard>"但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
<4-31,Leonard>"but I'll always have feelings for you."

203
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,640
<4-32,Penny>"是这样的  丽莎"
<4-32,Penny>"Here's the thing, Lisa,

204
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,790
<4-29,Leonard>"我现在喜欢男的了  但我对你的感觉永远不会变"
<4-29,Leonard>I'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you."

205
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,470
<4-30,Penny>那你会怎么说
<4-30,Penny>How would you say it?

206
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,160
<4-31,Leonard>我对你的感觉不会变
<4-31,Leonard>I have feelings for you.

207
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,610
<4-32,Penny>-这不是一样嘛  -不一样
<4-32,Penny>- It's the same thing. - No, it's not.

208
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,830
<4-33,Leonard>加上"永远"只会适得其反
<4-33,Leonard>"Always" made it worse.

209
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,280
<4-34,Penny>-你想太多了  -我没有
<4-34,Penny>- You're overthinking this. - No, I'm not.

210
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,000
<4-36,Penny>你有  你永远都是这样
<4-36,Penny>Yes, you are. You always overthink things.

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,950
<4-37,Leonard>你看吧  一加"永远"就变味了
<4-37,Leonard>Th-There you go. "Always" made it worse.

212
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,950
<4-38,Penny>瞧  我们一谈起来  就开始吵架
<4-38,Penny>See, this is where everything goes wrong: when we talk.

213
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,760
<4-39,Leonard>谈恋爱当然要用"谈"的啦
<4-39,Leonard>Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.

214
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,470
<4-40,Penny>我以前还跟一个叫TJ的家伙在一起八个月
<4-40,Penny>Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months,

215
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,240
<4-40,Penny>我们从来没谈过话
<4-40,Penny>we never talked.

216
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,640
<4-40,Penny>直到现在  我都不知道TJ代表啥
<4-40,Penny>To this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for.

217
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,760
<4-41,Leonard>等等  你们要是不谈的话
<4-41,Leonard>Wait, if you guys didn't talk, what--

218
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,700
<4-41,Leonard>算了  这问题真二
<4-41,Leonard>Never mind, stupid question.

219
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,030
<5-1,Sheldon>我现在有硬木了
<5-1,Sheldon>And now that I have some wood,

220
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,330
<5-1,Sheldon>我的殖民地要开始"崛起"了
<5-1,Sheldon>I'm going to begin the erection of my settlement.

221
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,270
<5-2,Raj>他肯定是故意这么说的
<5-2,Raj>He's got to be doing this on purpose.

222
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,930
<5-2,Raj>才八点半呢
<5-2,Raj>Ooh, 8:30.

223
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,230
<5-3,Howard (as Leonard enters)>你跟佩妮是出去打酱油的吗
<5-3,Howard (as Leonard enters)>You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?

224
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,010
<5-4,Leonard>某人都三十岁了  还跟妈妈同住一屋
<5-4,Leonard>You are 30 years old and you live with your mother.

225
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,120
<5-5,Raj>看来约会不太顺利
<5-5,Raj>I guess it didn't go well.

226
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,680
<5-6,Sheldon>我们可不知道
<5-6,Sheldon>We don't know that.

227
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,910
<5-6,Sheldon>不能确定
<5-6,Sheldon>Not to a certainty.

228
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,380
<5-6,Sheldon>我们只知道莱纳德到家了
<5-6,Sheldon>All we know is that Leonard is home.

229
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,510
<5-7,Howard (as Leonard groans loudly in his room)>现在呢
<5-7,Howard (as Leonard groans loudly in his room)>How about now?

230
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,260
<5-8,Sheldon>证据还是不够
<5-8,Sheldon>Again, not enough evidence.

231
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,640
<5-8,Sheldon>我们只知道他被谋杀了
<5-8,Sheldon>For all we know, he's being murdered.

232
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,900
<5-8,Sheldon>现在  继续游戏
<5-8,Sheldon>Now, back to our game.

233
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,970
<5-9,Raj>你不是在"崛起"中吗
<5-9,Raj>You were in the middle of an erection.

234
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,400
<5-10,Sheldon>对哦  那"玩意儿"就在我手中
<5-10,Sheldon>Oh, of course. It's right here in my hand.

235
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,770
<6-1,Leonard>她现在是想怎样
<6-1,Leonard>What does she want from me now?

236
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,530
<6-1,Leonard>怎么了
<6-1,Leonard>What's up?

237
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,140
<6-2,Penny>别想太多
<6-2,Penny>Do not overthink this.

238
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,690
<6-4,Penny>-我不懂  -一切尽在不言中
<6-4,Penny>- I don't understand. - Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

239
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,220
<6-5,Leonard>好吧  但是之前不是...
<6-5,Leonard>Okay, but earlier it seemed like...

240
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,980
<6-6,Penny>别说话
<6-6,Penny>No talking.

241
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,060
<6-7,Leonard>做的时候也不说话吗  因为有时我会想提问耶
<6-7,Leonard>Even during? 'Cause sometimes I have questions.

242
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,100
<7-1,Penny>挺不错
<7-1,Penny>Well, that was fun.

243
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,260
<7-2,Leonard>是啊  除掉我脚抽筋的部分
<7-2,Leonard>Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.

244
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,880
<7-3,Penny>但你还是挺住了
<7-3,Penny>You hung in there, though.

245
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,140
<7-4,Leonard>牺牲小我  成全大我
<7-4,Leonard>There was a lot at stake.

246
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,240
<7-5,Penny>你现在想做什么
<7-5,Penny>So what do you want to do now?

247
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,630
<7-6,Leonard>我想去拿我的哮喘吸入器
<7-6,Leonard>Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler,

248
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,260
<7-6,Leonard>但这样就太毁气氛了
<7-6,Leonard>but it might ruin the moment.

249
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,890
<7-6,Leonard>我还是不明白
<7-6,Leonard>Just, just help me out here.

250
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,160
<7-6,Leonard>为什么糟糕的约会能以滚床单收场
<7-6,Leonard>How does a miserable date end in sex?

251
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,550
<7-7,Penny>我也不知道  这太复杂了
<7-7,Penny>I don't know, it's complicated.

252
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,930
<7-8,Leonard>我很聪明的
<7-8,Leonard>Well, I'm a pretty smart guy,

253
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,090
<7-8,Leonard>而且现在血液主要在往大脑流动了
<7-8,Leonard>and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply,

254
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,360
<7-8,Leonard>试试也无妨嘛
<7-8,Leonard>so give it a go.

255
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,100
<7-8,Leonard>好吧  只是...
<7-8,Leonard>Okay, it's just,

256
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,710
<7-9,Penny>在餐厅里你说想
<7-9,Penny>at the restaurant when you said

257
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,010
<7-9,Penny>想跟我复合
<7-9,Penny>you wanted us to be together again,

258
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,490
<7-9,Penny>感觉太真实太突然了  我吓到了
<7-9,Penny>it got very real very fast and I panicked.

259
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,960
<7-9,Penny>为什么
<7-9,Penny>Why?

260
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,950
<7-10,Leonard>你在怕什么
<7-10,Leonard>What are you afraid of?

261
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,890
<7-11,Penny>要是我们真的和好了
<7-11,Penny>Well, what if we do go out

262
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,310
<7-11,Penny>但我又做了什么蠢事  又把你甩了怎么办
<7-11,Penny>and I do something stupid and dump you again?

263
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,970
<7-12,Leonard>怎么就不是我甩你呢
<7-12,Leonard>What if I dump you?

264
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,950
<7-13,Penny>得了  别闹
<7-13,Penny>Come on, be serious.

265
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,340
<7-14,Leonard>那不然我们都不把这当成是谈恋爱
<7-14,Leonard>Well, how about if we don't think about this as a relationship?

266
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,640
<7-14,Leonard>就好比是一款新的软件
<7-14,Leonard>It could be more like a new version of software.

267
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,600
<7-14,Leonard>佩妮和莱纳德2.0升级版
<7-14,Leonard>Penny and Leonard 2.0.

268
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,590
<7-14,Leonard>我们可以先内测捉虫
<7-14,Leonard>We can test it internally, shake out the bugs,

269
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,900
<7-14,Leonard>等我们都觉得稳定了
<7-14,Leonard>and if we both feel it's solid,

270
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,060
<7-14,Leonard>到时再公之于众
<7-14,Leonard>then we'll roll it out to the public.

271
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,730
<7-15,Penny>那我们先不告诉别人我们复合了
<7-15,Penny>So we don't tell people we're back together?

272
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,490
<7-16,Leonard>是的
<7-16,Leonard>Exactly.

273
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,720
<7-16,Leonard>我们假装约会进展不顺利
<7-16,Leonard>We pretend like our date went badly.

274
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,560
<7-17,Penny>这已经不用假装了
<7-17,Penny>Well, we don't really have to pretend.

275
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,230
<7-18,Leonard>我们让他们以为我们决定只做朋友
<7-18,Leonard>And we let them think that we decided to just be friends

276
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,600
<7-18,Leonard>那样的话就没问题了
<7-18,Leonard>and that everything's cool.

277
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,130
<7-19,Penny>好啊
<7-19,Penny>Okay, great.

278
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,860
<7-19,Penny>我刚想起来
<7-19,Penny>Hey, I just remembered.

279
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,280
<7-19,Penny>我还留着你的吸入器
<7-19,Penny>I still got one of your inhalers.

280
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,450
<7-20,Leonard>不敢相信你还留着
<7-20,Leonard>I can't believe you kept this.

281
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,140
<7-21,Penny>我本来想扔掉  但还是舍不得
<7-21,Penny>Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn't.

282
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,680
<7-22,Leonard>你太贴心了
<7-22,Leonard>That is so sweet.

283
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,990
<7-22,Leonard>大概再过二十五到三十分钟  你就能知道
<7-22,Leonard>In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you

284
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,750
<7-22,Leonard>这对我的意义有多"重大"了
<7-22,Leonard>how much this means to me.

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,730
<8-1,Sheldon>莱纳德
<8-1,Sheldon>Leonard?

286
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,420
<8-2,Leonard>好啊
<8-2,Leonard>Yeah, hi, hi.

287
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,400
<8-2,Leonard>你好吗
<8-2,Leonard>How's it going?

288
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,490
<8-3,Sheldon>没什么不好
<8-3,Sheldon>Uh, can't complain.

289
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,890
<8-3,Sheldon>不过还是谢谢
<8-3,Sheldon>Thanks for asking.

290
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,890
<8-3,Sheldon>你凌晨三点在外面做什么
<8-3,Sheldon>Well, what were you doing out at 3:00 in the morning?

291
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,490
<8-4,Leonard>那你又在做什么
<8-4,Leonard>Well, uh, uh... what are you doing up?

292
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,230
<8-5,Sheldon>我上厕所啊
<8-5,Sheldon>I was using the bathroom.

293
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,360
<8-6,Leonard>我也是
<8-6,Leonard>Yeah, well, so was I.

294
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,570
<8-6,Leonard>真的吗
<8-6,Leonard>Really?

295
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,180
<8-7,Sheldon>我怎么在里面没看到你
<8-7,Sheldon>I didn't see you in there.

296
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,710
<8-8,Leonard>显然我看到你在用了
<8-8,Leonard>Obviously... when I saw that you were in ours,

297
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,590
<8-8,Leonard>所以我就出去用其它的了
<8-8,Leonard>I went and used another one.

298
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,740
<8-9,Sheldon>上哪去用了
<8-9,Sheldon>Where?

299
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,080
<8-10,Leonard>马路对面的加油站
<8-10,Leonard>The, the gas station across the street.

300
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,080
<8-11,Sheldon>穿着睡衣去
<8-11,Sheldon>In your pajamas?

301
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,980
<8-12,Leonard>是啊
<8-12,Leonard>Yes.

302
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,430
<8-13,Sheldon>还没穿鞋去
<8-13,Sheldon>Without shoes?

303
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,980
<8-14,Leonard>是啊
<8-14,Leonard>Yes.

304
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,740
<8-15,Sheldon>大冬天三更半夜去
<8-15,Sheldon>On a cold winter's night?

305
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,670
<8-16,Leonard>是啊
<8-16,Leonard>Yes.

306
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,740
<8-17,Sheldon>不太可能啊
<8-17,Sheldon>Seems unlikely.

307
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,000
<8-17,Sheldon>你带你的哮喘吸入器了吗
<8-17,Sheldon>Did you bring your asthma inhaler?

308
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,580
<8-18,Leonard>是的  我当然带了
<8-18,Leonard>Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.

309
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,780
<8-19,Sheldon>那貌似就可信了
<8-19,Sheldon>Well, then, I guess it's plausible.

310
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,690
<8-19,Sheldon>-等等  先生  -干嘛
<8-19,Sheldon>- D-- hang on a second, mister. - What?

311
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,550
<8-21,Sheldon>你用过加油站的厕所后
<8-21,Sheldon>After you used the facilities at the gas station,

312
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,090
<8-21,Sheldon>-买东西了吗  -什么
<8-21,Sheldon>- did you make a purchase? - What?

313
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,560
<8-23,Sheldon>这是国际惯例  你用了零售店的厕所
<8-23,Sheldon>It's customary, when using the restroom

314
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,040
<8-23,Sheldon>就要随便买点东西
<8-23,Sheldon>at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase.

315
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,940
<8-24,Leonard>你买了吗
<8-24,Leonard>Did you?

316
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,760
<8-24,Leonard>没有
<8-24,Leonard>No.

317
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,720
<8-24,Leonard>给你两块钱
<8-24,Leonard>Here's two dollars.

318
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,060
<8-25,Sheldon>去买点牛肉干
<8-25,Sheldon>Go buy some beef jerky.

319
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,300
<8-26,Leonard>我不想吃牛肉干
<8-26,Leonard>I don't want beef jerky.

320
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,470
<8-27,Sheldon>这不是你想不想的问题
<8-27,Sheldon>It's not about you.

321
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,140
<8-27,Sheldon>这关系到可怜的巴基斯坦移民
<8-27,Sheldon>It's about a poor immigrant from Pakistan

322
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,780
<8-27,Sheldon>在科罗拉多大道的
<8-27,Sheldon>trying to make his way in America

323
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,310
<8-27,Sheldon>雪佛龙公司上夜班
<8-27,Sheldon>by working the graveyard shift

324
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,300
<8-27,Sheldon>就为了在美国混口饭吃
<8-27,Sheldon>at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.

325
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,960
<8-28,Leonard>好吧
<8-28,Leonard>Fine.

326
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,870
<8-29,Sheldon>还真是越缺爱的小孩越贪心啊
<8-29,Sheldon>Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.

327
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,000
<9-1,Sheldon>莱纳德马上就来了
<9-1,Sheldon>Leonard will be here in a moment.

328
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,450
<9-1,Sheldon>他要重找一个停车位
<9-1,Sheldon>He's looking for a different parking space.

329
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,400
<9-2,Howard>为什么
<9-2,Howard>Why?

330
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,950
<9-3,Sheldon>我们旁边停着一辆车
<9-3,Sheldon>We were next to a car

331
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,700
<9-3,Sheldon>上面贴着一张贴纸  写着"聊聊我的孙子们"
<9-3,Sheldon>with an "Ask me about my grandchildren." bumper sticker,

332
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,070
<9-3,Sheldon>我担心如果走的时候遇到那辆车的车主
<9-3,Sheldon>and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out,

333
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,170
<9-3,Sheldon>我就有义务就跟他聊
<9-3,Sheldon>I'd be obligated to do so.

334
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,350
<9-4,Bernadette>他跟佩妮的约会居然失败了  我好失望
<9-4,Bernadette>I'm so disappointed it didn't work with him and Penny.

335
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,880
<9-4,Bernadette>我也是
<9-4,Bernadette>Me, too.

336
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,120
<9-5,Amy>为了不伤害到他们
<9-5,Amy>Out of deference to them,

337
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,820
<9-5,Amy>咱们就别炫耀自家的完美恋情了
<9-5,Amy>let's not flaunt our happy relationship.

338
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,100
<9-6,Sheldon>你还真是体贴善良啊
<9-6,Sheldon>You have a keen insight into the human heart,

339
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,610
<9-6,Sheldon>艾米·费拉·福勒
<9-6,Sheldon>Amy Farrah Fowler.

341
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,750
<9-7,Leonard>现在旁边那辆斯巴鲁上贴着一张写着"戈尔/利伯曼"的贴纸
<9-7,Leonard>We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.

342
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,500
<9-8,Sheldon>我觉得他们不会想聊那个  所以我们安全了
<9-8,Sheldon>Well, I doubt they'd want to talk about that, so we're fine.

343
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,820
<9-9,Howard>你跟佩妮的约会搞砸了
<9-9,Howard>I'm surprised to see you here

344
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,930
<9-9,Howard>你居然还会来这吃饭
<9-9,Howard>after it went so badly with Penny.

345
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,640
<9-10,Leonard>我们都是大人了
<9-10,Leonard>Well, hey, we're grown-ups.

346
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,200
<9-10,Leonard>买卖不成仁义在嘛
<9-10,Leonard>We can still be friends.

347
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,390
<9-11,Bernadette>天啊  要是我跟霍华德分手了
<9-11,Bernadette>Boy, I don't know if I could be friends with Howie

348
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,800
<9-11,Bernadette>估计就做不成朋友了
<9-11,Bernadette>if we broke up.

349
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,650
<9-12,Howard>为什么
<9-12,Howard>Why not?

350
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,980
<9-13,Bernadette>我是个报复心很重的人
<9-13,Bernadette>I'm a very vengeful person.

351
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,960
<9-14,Howard>真的吗
<9-14,Howard>Really?

352
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,530
<9-15,Bernadette>而且我还能弄到改造成生化武器的天花
<9-15,Bernadette>With access to weaponized smallpox.

353
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,990
<9-16,Penny>伙计们  我先给你们上点水
<9-16,Penny>Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water.

354
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,610
<9-16,Penny>你们要看菜单吗  还是已经想好要点什么了
<9-16,Penny>You need menus or you know what you want?

355
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,550
<9-17,Howard>莱纳德知道自己想要什么
<9-17,Howard>Leonard knows what he wants,

356
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,690
<9-17,Howard>不过看来从你这是捞不着了
<9-17,Howard>but it looks like he's not gonna get it from you.

357
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,180
<9-18,Bernadette>霍华德
<9-18,Bernadette>Howard.

358
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,930
<9-19,Penny>不  没事  伯纳黛特
<9-19,Penny>No, that's okay, Bernadette.

359
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,230
<9-19,Penny>有些人就是不适合在一起
<9-19,Penny>Sometimes these things just don't work out.

360
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,670
<9-20,Leonard>没错  不过没关系
<9-20,Leonard>Yeah, it's all good.

361
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,560
<9-20,Leonard>我们  我们对彼此的感觉永远不会变
<9-20,Leonard>We-We'll always have feelings for each other.

362
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,030
<9-21,Bernadette>还真是不错啊
<9-21,Bernadette>Oh, that's nice.

363
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,830
<9-22,Leonard>看吧  她也知道"永远"的含义
<9-22,Leonard>See, she knew what "always" meant.

364
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,110
<9-23,Penny>你就是得理不饶人是吧
<9-23,Penny>Wow, you're like a dog with a bone, aren't you?

365
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
<9-24,Leonard>我只是想证明我的观点而已
<9-24,Leonard>I'm just making a point.

366
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
<9-25,Penny>你不知道该何时放手的观点吗
<9-25,Penny>Is the point that you don't know when to let something go?

367
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,660
<9-26,Sheldon>够了  够了
<9-26,Sheldon>People, people,

368
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,560
<9-26,Sheldon>拜托  在你俩开始说一些会后悔的话时
<9-26,Sheldon>please, before you say something you both regret,

369
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,350
<9-26,Sheldon>我想先点菜

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,690
<9-27,Penny>你知道咱俩为什么不能做情侣吗
<9-27,Penny>You know why we can't be together?

372
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,220
<9-27,Penny>因为对的永远你  错的永远我
<9-27,Penny>Because you always have to be right.

373
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,770
<9-28,Leonard>才不是呢
<9-28,Leonard>Oh, that is not true.

374
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,040
<9-29,Sheldon>这点我认同莱纳德
<9-29,Sheldon>I got to go with Leonard on this.

375
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,290
<9-29,Sheldon>他是我认识的人中犯错最多的
<9-29,Sheldon>He is wrong more than anyone I know.

376
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,210
<9-30,Penny>我刚想起来现在是我的休息时间
<9-30,Penny>You know what? I just realized I'm on a break.

377
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,880
<9-30,Penny>我叫别人过来给你们点单
<9-30,Penny>I'll get someone else.

378
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,000
<9-32,Sheldon>莱纳德  你要保证等我们下一个女招待过来以后
<9-32,Sheldon>Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over,

379
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,900
<9-32,Sheldon>你绝不可以一会儿跟她玩复合
<9-32,Sheldon>you will not start a complicated on-again,

380
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,370
<9-32,Sheldon>一会儿跟她玩翻脸的恋情
<9-32,Sheldon>off-again relationship with her,

381
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,270
<9-32,Sheldon>因为我现在非常非常饿
<9-32,Sheldon>because I am very, very hungry.

382
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,380
<10-1,Leonard>真是难以置信
<10-1,Leonard>Unbelievable.

383
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,140
<10-2,Penny>你想解释一下你在餐厅里的时候
<10-2,Penny>Mind explaining to me why you were being

384
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,560
<10-2,Penny>表现得像个混蛋一样吗
<10-2,Penny>such a jerk at the restaurant?

385
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,630
<10-3,Leonard>我那是努力装作咱们没有复合
<10-3,Leonard>I was trying to act like we weren't seeing each other.

386
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,900
<10-3,Leonard>-这不是咱俩的计划吗  -不是
<10-3,Leonard>- That was the plan, right?  - No,

387
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,310
<10-4,Penny>计划是告诉他们  咱们决定只当朋友
<10-4,Penny>the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends.

388
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,480
<10-4,Penny>你整天那么讨人厌
<10-4,Penny>That's a little hard to do

389
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,400
<10-4,Penny>弄得我也很难演下去
<10-4,Penny>when you're always being such a tool bag.

390
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,840
<10-5,Leonard>我用不着站在这听你数落
<10-5,Leonard>You know what? I don't have to stand here and take this crap.

391
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,430
<10-6,Penny>你这是去哪呀
<10-6,Penny>The hell do you think you're going?

392
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,550
<10-7,Leonard>咱俩现在不就是一吵完架就上床吗
<10-7,Leonard>Isn't sex after fighting kind of what we do now?!

393
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,680
<10-8,Penny>好吧  说得没错
<10-8,Penny>Yeah, kind of, yeah.

394
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,300
<11-1,Leonard>我们这是干嘛啊
<11-1,Leonard>What are we doing?

395
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,600
<11-2,Penny>什么意思
<11-2,Penny>What do you mean?

396
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,800
<11-3,Leonard>我每次幻想到咱俩在一起的场面  结局总是很糟
<11-3,Leonard>Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.

397
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,800
<11-4,Penny>那是因为你总是想得太多
<11-4,Penny>That's because you overthink everything.

398
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,970
<11-5,Sheldon’s voice><i>莱纳德  你在听我说话吗</i>
<11-5,Sheldon’s voice>Leonard, are you listening to me?

<11-7,Sheldon>扎克瑞·昆图站在我的床脚
<11-7,Sheldon>Why would I feel safer

404
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,410
<11-7,Sheldon>怎么能让我觉得安全呢
<11-7,Sheldon>with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?

405
