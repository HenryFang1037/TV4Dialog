1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,890
<1-1,Howard>谢尔顿  你错了
<1-1,Howard>Sheldon, you're wrong.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,300
<1-1,Howard>金刚狼出生时没有骨爪
<1-1,Howard>Wolverine was not born with bone claws.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,020
<1-1,Howard>霍华德
<1-1,Howard>Howard,

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,720
<1-2,Sheldon>你知道我是个聪明绝顶的人
<1-2,Sheldon>you know me to be a very smart man.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,720
<1-2,Sheldon>我要是错了  我能不知道吗
<1-2,Sheldon>Don't you think if I were wrong, I'd know it?

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,620
<1-3,Howard>-首先...  -算了吧
<1-3,Howard>- Okay, first of all... - Give it up, dude.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,150
<1-4,Raj>别跟疯子争辩了
<1-4,Raj>You're arguing with a crazy person.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,550
<1-5,Sheldon>我不是疯子
<1-5,Sheldon>I'm not crazy.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,150
<1-5,Sheldon>我妈妈带我去检测过
<1-5,Sheldon>My mother had me tested.

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,550
<1-7,Howard>-伙计们  -你来这干嘛
<1-7,Howard>- Hey, guys. - What are you doing here?

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,450
<1-8,Leonard>你说呢  今晚是新漫画书之夜啊
<1-8,Leonard>What do you mean? It's new comic book night.

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,450
<1-9,Raj>鉴于你和佩妮终于勾搭上了
<1-9,Raj>Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,120
<1-9,Raj>我们以为你们会来个光溜溜之夜呢
<1-9,Raj>you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.

14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,950
<1-10,Leonard>生活并非只有性爱  拉杰
<1-10,Leonard>There's more to life than sex, Raj.

15
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,150
<1-11,Howard>谁认同"莱佩情24小时内熄火"
<1-11,Howard>Okay, who had "Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours"?

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,350
<1-12,Sheldon>我
<1-12,Sheldon>I did.

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,020
<1-13,Leonard>什么都没熄火
<1-13,Leonard>Nothing flamed out.

18
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,020
<1-13,Leonard>我们没必要夜夜春宵
<1-13,Leonard>We don't have to have sex every night, you know.

19
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,020
<1-14,Howard>是没必要  但强烈推荐啊
<1-14,Howard>You don't have to, but it's highly recommended.

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,350
<1-15,Raj>在机遇之窗猛然关闭之前
<1-15,Raj>Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity

21
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,490
<1-15,Raj>好好利用这段绝佳时期
<1-15,Raj>before it slams shut on your little dinky.

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,550
<1-16,Leonard>这不是机遇的问题
<1-16,Leonard>It's not a matter of opptunity.

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,890
<1-16,Leonard>我们要了解对方
<1-16,Leonard>We're getting to know each other.

24
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,490
<1-16,Leonard>有学习的曲折过程
<1-16,Leonard>There's a learning curve.

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,590
<1-17,Howard>有什么可学的
<1-17,Howard>What's there to learn?

26
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,150
<1-17,Howard>脱光光  互相猥亵对方
<1-17,Howard>You get naked, do nasty things to each other,

27
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,020
<1-17,Howard>然后某人做做炒蛋和香肠
<1-17,Howard>then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami.

28
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,250
<1-17,Howard>小菜一碟
<1-17,Howard>Easy peasy.

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,590
<1-18,Sheldon>或许莱纳德
<1-18,Sheldon>Perhaps what Leonard

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,220
<1-18,Sheldon>间接所指的
<1-18,Sheldon>is oblique referring to

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,650
<1-18,Sheldon>是性功能障碍吧
<1-18,Sheldon>is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,150
<1-19,Raj>谁认同"小莱软趴了"
<1-19,Raj>Okay, who had "Leonard gets a floppy disk"?

33
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,690
<1-20,Sheldon>真聪明  虽然这种委婉表达
<1-20,Sheldon>Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism

34
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,220
<1-20,Sheldon>男性性器官充血不足的说法过时了
<1-20,Sheldon>for insufficient blood flow the male sex organ.

35
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,590
<1-21,Leonard>不是那么回事
<1-21,Leonard>Nothing like that happened, all right?

36
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,720
<1-21,Leonard>那次做爱...挺好
<1-21,Leonard>The sex was... just fine.

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,750
<1-22,Raj>挺好
<1-22,Raj>Just fine?

38
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,890
<1-22,Raj>《哈利·波特》第4部也"挺好"
<1-22,Raj>Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was "just fine."

39
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,850
<1-23,Leonard>我没说它很差
<1-23,Leonard>I'm not saying it was bad.

40
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,520
<1-23,Leonard>我只是说...不是非常好
<1-23,Leonard>I'm just saying it... wasn't great.

41
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,650
<1-24,Howard>你说的"不是非常好"
<1-24,Howard>Okay, when you say "it wasn'great,"

42
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,920
<1-24,Howard>是指你们都这么认为吗
<1-24,Howard>do you mean for both of you?

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,920
<1-24,Howard>我们完全可以认为她觉得不好
<1-24,Howard>Because we can totally see it not being great for her.

44
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,450
<1-25,Raj>-对吧  -没错
<1-25,Raj>- Am I right? - Oh, yeah.

45
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,120
<1-26,Leonard>说实话  我想我们都有点...
<1-26,Leonard>To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little...

46
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,190
<1-26,Leonard>我不知道
<1-26,Leonard>I don't know.

47
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,590
<1-27,Raj>沮丧  失望
<1-27,Raj>Disappointed? Let down?

48
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,650
<1-28,Howard>羞愧  恐惧  厌恶
<1-28,Howard>Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?

49
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,920
<1-29,Leonard>我只觉得跟梦想中的不一样
<1-29,Leonard>All I know is, it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.

50
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,720
<1-30,Howard>真正做爱跟我梦想中的从来都不一样
<1-30,Howard>Sex is never the way I dream it's gonna be.

51
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,890
<1-31,Raj>那是因为在梦中
<1-31,Raj>That's because in your dreams,

52
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,490
<1-31,Raj>你是半人马
<1-31,Raj>you're a horse from the waist down.

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,420
<1-31,Raj>打扰了  《金刚狼前传》
<1-31,Raj>Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin.

<1-32,Sheldon>迷你剧2  第22页
<1-32,Sheldon>Miniseries issue two, page 22.

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,390
<1-32,Sheldon>伸缩自如的骨爪
<1-32,Sheldon>Retractable bone claws.

56
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,720
<1-32,Sheldon>你们要是能少花点时间在性上
<1-32,Sheldon>If you people spent less time thinking about sex

57
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,620
<1-32,Sheldon>多花点时间在漫画书上
<1-32,Sheldon>and more time concentrating on comic books,

58
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,820
<1-32,Sheldon>我们就能减少相当多的尴尬时刻了
<1-32,Sheldon>we'd have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.

59
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
<1-32,Sheldon>生活大爆炸

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,700
<2-3,Leonard>不  我们去了家新餐馆
<2-3,Leonard>No, we went somewhere new.

63
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,970
<2-4,Sheldon>你们是在嘲笑我是吗
<2-4,Sheldon>You're good naturedly ribbing me, aren't you?

64
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,100
<2-5,Leonard>没有  看  孟买膳宫
<2-5,Leonard>No, look, Mumbai Palace.

65
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,330
<2-5,Leonard>为什么
<2-5,Leonard>Why?

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,070
<2-6,Sheldon>为什么要改变
<2-6,Sheldon>Why would we change?

67
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,570
<2-6,Sheldon>已经有个完美的膳宫了
<2-6,Sheldon>We had a perfectly good palace.

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,530
<2-6,Sheldon>唐杜里膳宫就是我们的御膳房
<2-6,Sheldon>Tandoori Palace is our palace.

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,170
<2-7,Leonard>相信我  这个也挺好
<2-7,Leonard>Trust me, this will be just fine.

70
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,400
<2-8,Howard>你可是"挺好"的
<2-8,Howard>You are the authority

71
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,330
<2-8,Howard>权威代表
<2-8,Howard>on "just fine."

72
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,230
<2-9,Leonard>那是什么意思
<2-9,Leonard>What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,130
<2-10,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>就是"不差  也不好"
<2-10,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>It's actually "Not bad, but not great".

74
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,130
<2-11,Penny>他们在说什么
<2-11,Penny>What are they talking about?

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,900
<2-12,Leonard>-我不知道  -我知道
<2-12,Leonard>- I don't know. - I know.

76
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,200
<2-13,Sheldon>我相信你已发现
<2-13,Sheldon>As I'm sure you're aware...

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
<2-14,Leonard>哒哒哒哒哒哒
<2-14,Leonard>Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

78
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,490
<2-15,Sheldon>如果你用的是莫尔斯电码
<2-15,Sheldon>If that's Morse code,

79
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,470
<2-15,Sheldon>未免太没水平了
<2-15,Sheldon>That's terrible.

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,130
<2-15,Sheldon>言归正传  你和莱纳德
<2-15,Sheldon>As I was saying, you and Leonard had

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,630
<2-15,Sheldon>的性爱比较失望
<2-15,Sheldon>a disappointing sexual encounter.

82
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,770
<2-15,Sheldon>今天傍晚
<2-15,Sheldon>Earlier this evening,

83
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,930
<2-15,Sheldon>莱纳德将其描述为"挺好"
<2-15,Sheldon>Leonard characterized as "just fine."

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,400
<2-15,Sheldon>所以你看到的只是
<2-15,Sheldon>So what you're seeing here is a continuation

85
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,630
<2-15,Sheldon>嘲笑的后续篇
<2-15,Sheldon>of the mocking that followed.

86
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,470
<2-16,Penny>行啊
<2-16,Penny>xyzzz xyzzz Okay, yeah, well,

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,170
<2-16,Penny>我去其他地方吃饭吧
<2-16,Penny>I'm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere.

88
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,330
<2-16,Penny>说不定去一架要撞山的飞机上
<2-16,Penny>Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.

89
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,400
<2-17,Leonard>佩妮  等等
<2-17,Leonard>Penny, wait.

90
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,370
<2-17,Leonard>你有毛病啊
<2-17,Leonard>What is wrong with you?

91
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,170
<2-18,Sheldon>我感觉自己貌似说过分了
<2-18,Sheldon>I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.

92
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,700
<2-19,Raj>-对  你...  -别告诉他
<2-19,Raj>- Yeah, you... - No, don't tell him.

93
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,930
<2-20,Howard>看他能不能弄懂
<2-20,Howard>Let's see if he can figure it out.

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,470
<2-21,Penny>简直羞死人了
<2-21,Penny>Ugh, I am so embarrassed!

95
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,670
<2-22,Leonard>别生气嘛
<2-22,Leonard>Please don't be mad.

96
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,930
<2-23,Penny>你跟他们说了什么
<2-23,Penny>What did you tell them?

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,770
<2-24,Leonard>没什么  就说昨晚的事挺好
<2-24,Leonard>Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.

98
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,170
<2-25,Penny>挺好?  你说挺好?
<2-25,Penny>Fine? You said it was fine?

99
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,370
<2-26,Leonard>这个词很好啊
<2-26,Leonard>Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

100
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,200
<2-26,Leonard>放在"酒"和"餐"前面
<2-26,Leonard>You put it in front of "wine" or "dining,"

101
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,600
<2-26,Leonard>效果不是很好嘛
<2-26,Leonard>and you've really got something.

102
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,970
<2-26,Leonard>我想问问你
<2-26,Leonard>Okay, well, let me ask you this:

103
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,700
<2-26,Leonard>你觉得昨晚怎么样
<2-26,Leonard>How was last night for you?

104
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,530
<2-27,Penny>我觉得...还行
<2-27,Penny>It was... okay.

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,500
<2-28,Leonard>还行?
<2-28,Leonard>Okay?

106
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,970
<2-28,Leonard>这个词很好啊
<2-28,Leonard>Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

107
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,000
<2-29,Penny>放在"不错"前面
<2-29,Penny>xyzzz xyzzz I mean, you put it in front of "dokay"

108
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,830
<2-29,Penny>效果也很好啊
<2-29,Penny>And you really got something.

109
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,700
<2-29,Penny>算了  别小题大做了
<2-29,Penny>All right, look, let's not overreact, you know.

110
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,130
<2-29,Penny>很多情侣都需要时间
<2-29,Penny>For a lot of couples, it takes time

111
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,730
<2-29,Penny>才能了解彼此的节奏
<2-29,Penny>to get to know each other's rhythms.

112
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,870
<2-29,Penny>明白对方的喜好
<2-29,Penny>Learn what the other person was and likes.

113
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,830
<2-30,Leonard>这么说你以前有过经验?
<2-30,Leonard>So, you've been through this before?

114
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,200
<2-31,Penny>没有
<2-31,Penny>No.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
<2-32,Leonard>行啊
<2-32,Leonard>Okay-dokay.

116
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,870
<2-33,Penny>我觉得这件事
<2-33,Penny>You know, I think this is one of those things where

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,430
<2-33,Penny>越讨论只会越糟糕
<2-33,Penny>talking about it is not going to make it better.

118
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,530
<2-33,Penny>喝一杯吗
<2-33,Penny>Want a glass of wine?

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,830
<2-34,Leonard>-正合我意  -好
<2-34,Leonard>So much. Okay

120
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,700
<2-35,Penny>我们昨晚就该这样嘛
<2-35,Penny>See, we should've done this last night.

121
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,630
<2-35,Penny>喝点小酒  刺激刺激
<2-35,Penny>You know, have a little wine, take the edge off.

122
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,430
<2-36,Leonard>事实上  酒精会抑制神经细胞的电传导
<2-36,Leonard>Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction

123
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,300
<2-36,Leonard>并会刺激感受器重新摄取抑制性神经递质
<2-36,Leonard>in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors

124
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,570
<2-36,Leonard>比如伽马氨基丁酸
<2-36,Leonard>of inhibitory neurotranmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

125
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,500
<2-37,Penny>闭嘴  喝酒就是
<2-37,Penny>Don't talk, just drink.

126
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,530
<2-38,Howard>不  你搞错了
<2-38,Howard>No, you're misunderstanding.

127
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,930
<2-38,Howard>谢夏不是真的女神(犹太人用以称呼非犹太的女人)
<2-38,Howard>A shiksa goddess isn't an actual goddess.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
<2-38,Howard>我们不用向她们祈祷
<2-38,Howard>And we don't pray to them.

129
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,230
<2-38,Howard>我们在她们身上祈祷
<2-38,Howard>We prey on them.

130
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,770
<2-39,Raj>管他呢  兄弟
<2-39,Raj>Whatever, dude.

131
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,570
<2-39,Raj>关键在于  莱纳德有他的女人而你没有
<2-39,Raj>The point is, Leonard's got one and you don't.

132
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,600
<2-40,Sheldon>我想到了
<2-40,Sheldon>Is this it

133
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,530
<2-40,Sheldon>当着莱纳德和佩妮的面
<2-40,Sheldon>It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life

134
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,030
<2-40,Sheldon>谈论他们的性生活是不合适的
<2-40,Sheldon>in front of Leonard and Penny.

135
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,570
<2-40,Sheldon>太棒了
<2-40,Sheldon>Oh, good!

136
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,300
<2-40,Sheldon>终于可以吃饭了
<2-40,Sheldon>Now I can eat.

137
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,500
<2-41,Raj>啥东西
<2-41,Raj>What's that?

138
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,000
<2-42,Howard>-好像是个蟋蟀  -等下
<2-42,Howard>Sounds like a cricket. Hang on.

139
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,100
<2-43,Sheldon>根据每分钟的鸣叫次数
<2-43,Sheldon>Based on the number of chirps per minute

140
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,530
<2-43,Sheldon>并结合房间的环境温度
<2-43,Sheldon>and the ambient temperature in this room,

141
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,630
<2-43,Sheldon>这是一只雪树蟋蟀
<2-43,Sheldon>it is a snowy tree cricket.

142
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,130
<2-44,Howard>靠  饶了我吧
<2-44,Howard>Oh, give me a freakin' break.

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,430
<2-44,Howard>你怎么可能知道
<2-44,Howard>How could you possibly know that?

144
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,800
<2-45,Sheldon>1980年  埃米尔·道贝尔
<2-45,Sheldon>In 1890, Emile Dolbear

145
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,000
<2-45,Sheldon>得出结论
<2-45,Sheldon>determined that there was

146
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,230
<2-45,Sheldon>雪树蟋蟀每分钟的鸣叫次数
<2-45,Sheldon>a fixed relationship between the number

147
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,030
<2-43,Sheldon>与环境温度之间
<2-43,Sheldon>of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket

148
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,500
<2-43,Sheldon>存在着固定的关系
<2-43,Sheldon>and the ambient temperature.

149
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,170
<2-45,Sheldon>而在普通平原蟋蟀之中
<2-45,Sheldon>A precise relationship that is not present

150
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,170
<2-45,Sheldon>则不存在这种确切的关系
<2-45,Sheldon>with ordinary field crickets.

151
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,670
<2-46,Raj>你怎么会知道这房间的确切温度的
<2-46,Raj>How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?

152
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,600
<2-47,Sheldon>据我与莱纳德室友之间的协定
<2-47,Sheldon>Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard,

153
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,230
<2-47,Sheldon>自从06年那次"浸汗之夜"以来
<2-47,Sheldon>I've had unilateral control of thermostat

154
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,300
<2-47,Sheldon>就由我来专门负责室内的恒温控制
<2-47,Sheldon>ever since the sweaty night of '06.

155
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,130
<2-48,Howard>好吧  关于金刚狼的骨爪问题算你说对了
<2-48,Howard>Ok, you were right about wolverine and bone claws,

156
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,270
<2-48,Howard>但是这次你却错了
<2-48,Howard>but you're wrong about the cricket.

157
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,570
<2-49,Sheldon>霍华德  少给自己丢脸了
<2-49,Sheldon>Howard, don't embarrass yourself.

158
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,730
<2-49,Sheldon>科学就像虫鸣一样从不说谎
<2-49,Sheldon>The science chirps for itself.

159
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,600
<2-49,Sheldon>幽默的文字游戏而已
<2-49,Sheldon>Humorous word play.

160
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,230
<2-50,Howard>不  你绝对错了
<2-50,Howard>No, no, not this time.

161
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,470
<2-50,Howard>我可是昆虫的专家  伙计
<2-50,Howard>I know insects, my friend.

162
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,170
<2-50,Howard>我的整个童年时代
<2-50,Howard>I spent many

163
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,670
<2-50,Howard>基本都在用网捕虫
<2-50,Howard>childhood years capturing them with nets,

164
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,670
<2-50,Howard>把它们放在玻璃瓶里  用针钉成标本
<2-50,Howard>putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them,

165
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,000
<2-50,Howard>用瓦楞纸板做成标签
<2-50,Howard>mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels

166
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,570
<2-50,Howard>为它们分门别类属和种
<2-50,Howard>underneath, identifying the genus and species.

167
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,800
<2-50,Howard>用的可是拉丁文哦
<2-50,Howard>In Latin.

168
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,000
<2-51,Raj>天啊  老兄  你这辈子都别想得到女神垂青了
<2-51,Raj>Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.

169
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,200
<2-52,Sheldon>绝对是雪树蟋蟀
<2-52,Sheldon>That is a snowy tree cricket.

170
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,830
<2-52,Sheldon>雪树蟋蟀[拉丁语]
<2-52,Sheldon>Oecanthus fultoni.

171
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,130
<2-52,Sheldon>我早在五年级就通拉丁语了
<2-52,Sheldon>I was done with Latin by fifth grade.

172
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,700
<2-53,Howard>好吧  这么着吧
<2-53,Howard>Okay, okay, tell you what.

173
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,700
<2-53,Howard>这绝对是一只普通平原蟋蟀
<2-53,Howard>I am willing to bet anything

174
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,970
<2-53,Howard>要我赌啥都成
<2-53,Howard>that's an ordinary field cricket.

175
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,030
<2-54,Sheldon>我不能拿你的钱
<2-54,Sheldon>I can't take your money.

176
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,730
<2-55,Howard>这算啥  你临阵退缩吗[原词是英语里的鸡]
<2-55,Howard>What's the matter, you chicken?

177
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,630
<2-56,Sheldon>我总觉得这个用法很荒谬
<2-56,Sheldon>I've always found that an inappropriate slur.

178
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,030
<2-56,Sheldon>鸡这种动物天生就
<2-56,Sheldon>Chickens are not by nature,

179
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,230
<2-56,Sheldon>一点儿也不胆小
<2-56,Sheldon>at all timid.

180
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,730
<2-56,Sheldon>事实上  在我小时候
<2-56,Sheldon>In fact, when I was young,

181
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,130
<2-56,Sheldon>我邻居家系鸡的绳子松了
<2-56,Sheldon>my neighbor's chiken got loose

182
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,100
<2-56,Sheldon>它一直追着我跑到我家门口的大榆树
<2-56,Sheldon>and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.

183
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,840
<2-57,Raj>鸡不会爬树
<2-57,Raj>Chickens can't climb trees.

184
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,240
<2-58,Sheldon>谢天谢地
<2-58,Sheldon>Thank God.

185
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,640
<2-58,Sheldon>好吧
<2-58,Sheldon>Okay,

186
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,670
<2-59,Howard>我相信你和鸡有宿怨
<2-59,Howard>I believe a chicken made you his bitch.

187
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,800
<2-59,Howard>但是这件事我可不服
<2-59,Howard>But the cricket thing, I don't buy.

188
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,970
<2-59,Howard>打赌吧
<2-59,Howard>Bet me.

189
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,400
<2-60,Sheldon>好吧
<2-60,Sheldon>Fair enough.

190
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,740
<2-60,Sheldon>赌什么
<2-60,Sheldon>What stakes do you propose?

191
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,500
<2-61,Howard>就赌我的第四十八期神奇四侠-银影侠现身
<2-61,Howard>I would put my Fantastic Four of No. 48 first appearance of Silver Surfer,

192
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
<2-61,Howard>和你的第123期闪电侠
<2-61,Howard>against your Flash 123,

193
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,030
<2-61,Howard>两个世界的闪电侠经典系列
<2-61,Howard>the classic Flash of two worlds issue.

194
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,360
<2-62,Sheldon>好吧  就这么定了
<2-62,Sheldon>All right, you have a wager.

195
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,800
<2-63,Howard>真是太好了
<2-63,Howard>Hmm. Great.

196
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,300
<2-64,Raj>你们怎么确定输赢呢
<2-64,Raj>Now how are you going to settle it, hmm?

197
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,930
<2-64,Raj>只有通过实际观察
<2-64,Raj>There is no way to determine the species

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
<2-64,Raj>才能确定蟋蟀的种类吧
<2-64,Raj>of the criet without examining it.

199
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,000
<2-65,Raj>我在想今天那个不可怜的人在干嘛
<2-65,Raj>I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,860
<3-1,Leonard>-再来点  -好吧
<3-1,Leonard>-More wine? -Hit me.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,270
<4-1,Sheldon>啥都没有
<4-1,Sheldon>I don't see anything.

202
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,700
<4-2,Howard>嘘
<4-2,Howard>Shh!

203
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,170
<4-3,Raj>从走廊传来的
<4-3,Raj>Hallway.

204
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,130
<4-4,Sheldon>一个一个走
<4-4,Sheldon>One at a time.

205
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,130
<4-4,Sheldon>这次又是什么
<4-4,Sheldon>What was that?

206
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,030
<4-5,Raj>我的肚子在抗议
<4-5,Raj>My stomach.

207
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,070
<4-5,Raj>吃不惯印度菜
<4-5,Raj>Indian food doesn't agree with me.

208
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,470
<4-5,Raj>这算是讽刺吗
<4-5,Raj>Ironic, isn't it?

209
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,030
<4-5,Raj>嘘
<4-5,Raj>Shh!

210
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,770
<4-6,Howard>是电梯井
<4-6,Howard>Elevator shaft.

211
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,100
<4-7,Sheldon>快帮忙打开
<4-7,Sheldon>Help me open it.

212
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,330
<4-8,Howard>你疯了吗
<4-8,Howard>Are you crazy?

213
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,630
<4-8,Howard>我们不能下到空的电梯井里去
<4-8,Howard>We can't go down  empty elevator shaft.

214
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,570
<4-9,Sheldon>好啊  如果你退缩
<4-9,Sheldon>Fine, if you don't want to proceed,

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,770
<4-9,Sheldon>就要没收你的赌注
<4-9,Sheldon>then you forfeit the bet,

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,770
<4-9,Sheldon>而你的神奇四侠就归我了
<4-9,Sheldon>and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four.

217
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,130
<4-10,Howard>那就打开她吧
<4-10,Howard>Let's open her up.

218
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,130
<4-11,Sheldon>这么轻易被我操控  你不烦恼吗
<4-11,Sheldon>Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?

219
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,630
<4-12,Howard>别逼我  谢尔顿
<4-12,Howard>Don't push me, Sheldon.

220
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,270
<4-12,Howard>我是很矮  但我13岁时可学过功夫
<4-12,Howard>I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13,

221
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,800
<4-12,Howard>现在还没生疏呢
<4-12,Howard>and I remember a good deal of it.

222
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,000
<4-12,Howard>是吗
<4-12,Howard>Oh, really?

223
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,730
<4-13,Sheldon>我有一个哥哥
<4-13,Sheldon>Well, I grew up with an older brother

224
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,600
<4-13,Sheldon>还有一对非常好争论的双胞胎姐姐
<4-13,Sheldon>and a very contentious twin sister.

225
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,330
<4-13,Sheldon>所以我确信在任何物理对抗中我都占上风
<4-13,Sheldon>And I believe I could easily best you

226
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,930
<4-13,Sheldon>并足以揍得你找不到北
<4-13,Sheldon>in any physical confrontation-- be it noogies, swirlies

227
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,400
<4-13,Sheldon>记得那句经典名言吗  "你怎么自己打自己啊"
<4-13,Sheldon>or the classic "Why are you hitting yourself?"

228
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,730
<4-14,Raj>被鸡追得逃到树上的人还真敢吹啊
<4-14,Raj>Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.

229
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,630
<5-1,Leonard>我们现在喝的什么呀
<5-1,Leonard>What are we drinking now?

230
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,670
<5-2,Penny>薄荷杜松子酒
<5-2,Penny>Peppermint schnapps.

231
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,800
<5-3,Leonard>你买薄荷杜松子酒干嘛呀
<5-3,Leonard>Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?

232
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,800
<5-4,Penny>因为我喜欢薄荷
<5-4,Penny>Because I like peppermint,

233
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,830
<5-4,Penny>而且杜松子酒念起来很爽
<5-4,Penny>and it's fun to say schnapps.

234
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,670
<5-4,Penny>-喂  莱纳德  -什么
<5-4,Penny>- Hey, Leonard? - What?

235
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,170
<5-6,Penny>杜松子酒
<5-6,Penny>Schnapps.

236
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,200
<5-6,Penny>杜松子酒
<5-6,Penny>Schnapps.

237
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,270
<5-7,Leonard>你对极了  真好玩

239
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,270
<6-2,Sheldon>假若我不小心
<6-2,Sheldon>If I were not being careful,

240
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,100
<6-2,Sheldon>我不会因为你告诉我小心就小心
<6-2,Sheldon>your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
<6-3,Raj (hearing the cricket)>楼梯里
<6-3,Raj (hearing the cricket)>Stairwell.

242
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,100
<6-4,Sheldon>哦哦  手电灭了
<6-4,Sheldon>Uh-oh, flashlight went out.

243
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,600
<6-4,Sheldon>我需要电池
<6-4,Sheldon>I need some batteries.

244
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,670
<6-4,Sheldon>伙计们?
<6-4,Sheldon>Fellas?

245
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,630
<6-4,Sheldon>喂?
<6-4,Sheldon>Hello?

246
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,530
<6-4,Sheldon>这儿好黑呀
<6-4,Sheldon>It's really dark down here.

247
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,670
<7-1,Penny>唉  宝贝
<7-1,Penny>Oh, sweetie.

248
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
<7-1,Penny>你真是不会喝酒啊
<7-1,Penny>You really can't hold your liquor, can you?

249
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,400
<7-1,Penny>我没事
<7-1,Penny>I'm okay.

<7-2,Leonard>来点儿漱口水
<7-2,Leonard>Just a little mouthwash,

251
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,370
<7-2,Leonard>然后你就等着乐个够吧

<7-2,Leonard>你没事吧
<7-2,Leonard>Are you okay?

253

<7-2,Leonard>哎呀  托比  你上辈子造了什么孽
<7-2,Leonard>Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life

254
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,130
<8-1,Raj>现在活得这么恶心
<8-1,Raj>to be so disgusting now?

255
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,400
<8-2,Sheldon>他不叫托比
<8-2,Sheldon>His name isn't Toby.

256
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,700
<8-2,Sheldon>蟋蟀怎么能叫托比呢
<8-2,Sheldon>Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.

257
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,800
<8-3,Raj>那你会叫他什么
<8-3,Raj>What would you name him?

258
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,460
<8-4,Sheldon>适合蟋蟀的名字
<8-4,Sheldon>An appropriate cricket name.

259
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,830
<8-4,Sheldon>比如说  吉姆尼
<8-4,Sheldon>For example, Jiminy.

00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,130
<8-4,Sheldon>好好

<8-5,Howard>Hey Toby.

264
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,360
<8-5,Howard>就在这儿
<8-5,Howard>Right here.

265
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,400
<8-5,Howard>看见了?

268
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,130

<8-5,Howard>which is Latin for "suck it, you lose."

269
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,200
<8-5,Howard>等等
<8-5,Howard>Hang on.

270
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,830

<8-6,Sheldon>Of course I'm joking

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,660
<8-6,Sheldon>因为那个的拉丁文是nihil exsorbibo
<8-6,Sheldon>because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.

276
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,160
<8-7,Howard>这根本不是托比
<8-7,Howard>That is not Toby,

277

<8-11,Sheldon>显然是与谢萨女神的又一次失败肉体接触
<8-11,Sheldon>Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,760
<8-14,Howard>好好  随你怎么说
<8-14,Howard>Yeah, fine, whatever.

287
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,800
<8-14,Howard>事实是  你又错了

<8-15,Sheldon>咱们还没说清上次我什么时候错呢  好了
<8-15,Sheldon>We haven't established that I'm wrong once. All right.

289
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,500
<8-16,Howard>这么办吧  咱们下楼
<8-16,Howard>Tell you what. Let's go down

<8-16,Howard>托比究竟是哪种蟋蟀
<8-16,Howard>what kind of cricket Toby is.

293

<8-17,Sheldon>他是雪树蟋蟀
<8-17,Sheldon>He's a snowy tree cricket,

294
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,200
<8-17,Sheldon>而且他叫吉姆尼
<8-17,Sheldon>and his name is Jiminy.

295
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,160
<8-18,Leonard>我打赌要是在这屋里扔块石头
<8-18,Leonard>I bet I could throw a rock in this room

296
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,730
<8-18,Leonard>也能打中三个更好的朋友
<8-18,Leonard>and come up with three better friends.

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,060
<9-3,Raj>它们让我害怕
<9-3,Raj>They freak me out.

304

<9-4,Sheldon>你既怕虫子又怕女人
<9-4,Sheldon>You're afraid of insects and women.

317
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
<9-8,Sheldon>我是物理系的库珀博士
<9-8,Sheldon>I'm Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.

<9-13,Prof Crawley>让我先问你
<9-13,Prof Crawley>Let me ask you one first.

326
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
<9-13,Prof Crawley>一位世界知名的昆虫学家
<9-13,Prof Crawley>What's a world renowned entomologist

<9-13,Prof Crawley>and 20 years of experience to do with his life

329
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,600
<9-13,Prof Crawley>他实验室的经费之后他该干什么
<9-13,Prof Crawley>when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?

330
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,630
<9-14,Raj>向别人吐嘈
<9-14,Raj>Ask rhetorical questions

331

<9-15,Prof Crawley>What's your deal?

333
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,700
<9-15,Prof Crawley>他们是不是打算把我的职位外包到班加罗尔
<9-15,Prof Crawley>Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?

334
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,730
<9-16,Raj>我是新德里来的
<9-16,Raj>I'm from New Delhi.

335
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,730
<9-16,Raj>也许你该去问别的昆虫学家
<9-16,Raj>Maybe you should find another entomologist.

336
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
<9-17,Sheldon>不行不行  咱们来了就得弄清楚
<9-17,Sheldon>No, no. We're here. Let's settle this.

337
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,330
<9-17,Sheldon>教授  你能辨认出我们的蟋蟀吗
<9-17,Sheldon>Professor, can you identify our cricket?

338
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,760
<9-18,Prof Crawley>我当然能
<9-18,Prof Crawley>Of course I can.

<9-18,Prof Crawley>我能认出全世界所有的昆虫和节肢动物
<9-18,Prof Crawley>I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet.

340
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,900
<9-18,Prof Crawley>但我也一样得去
<9-18,Prof Crawley>Not that that's going

<9-18,Prof Crawley>投奔我住在奥克斯纳德的女儿
<9-18,Prof Crawley>to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard.

342
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,730
<9-18,Prof Crawley>而且这不是
<9-18,Prof Crawley>And we're not talking

343
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,260
<9-18,Prof Crawley>海滩旁边的奥克斯纳德
<9-18,Prof Crawley>Oxnard at the beach. No!

344
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,530
<9-18,Prof Crawley>我们说的是葱地中间的
<9-18,Prof Crawley>We're talking Oxnard

345
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
<9-18,Prof Crawley>奥克斯纳德
<9-18,Prof Crawley>in the onion fields.

347
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,300
<9-19,Howard>托比
<9-19,Howard>Toby?

348
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,360
<9-20,Prof Crawley>蟋蟀叫这名字真蠢
<9-20,Prof Crawley>What a stupid name for a cricket.

349
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,360
<9-21,Sheldon>我就说嘛
<9-21,Sheldon>Told ya.

350
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,060
<9-22,Prof Crawley>就是只普通黑蟋蟀
<9-22,Prof Crawley>It's a field cricket.

351
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,300
<9-24,Sheldon>-太好了  -不  等等
<9-24,Sheldon>- Yes! - No, no, wait.

352
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
<9-24,Sheldon>克莱利教授  你确定吗
<9-24,Sheldon>Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

353
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,030
<9-25,Prof Crawley>年轻人  我从8岁起就开始学习昆虫知识
<9-25,Prof Crawley>Young man,I've been studying insects since I was eight years old.

354
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,930
<9-25,Prof Crawley>知道上学时他们都叫我什么
<9-25,Prof Crawley>You know what they used to call me in school?

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,960
<9-25,Prof Crawley>爬虫克莱利
<9-25,Prof Crawley>Creepy Crawley.

356
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,860
<9-26,Sheldon>这么叫你或许很残忍
<9-26,Sheldon>Cruel as that may be,

357
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,960
<9-26,Sheldon>但并不能证明什么
<9-26,Sheldon>But this is not in itself a credential.

358
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,260
<9-27,Prof Crawley>给你们看点东西
<9-27,Prof Crawley>Let me show you something.

359
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,930
<9-27,Prof Crawley>看到没
<9-27,Prof Crawley>See that?

360
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,100
<9-27,Prof Crawley>这是以我克莱利命名的金龟子
<9-27,Prof Crawley>That's a Crawley's dung beetle.

361
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,730
<9-27,Prof Crawley>我在婆罗洲的热带雨林里长途跋涉了六个月
<9-27,Prof Crawley>I discovered it after spending six months slogging

362
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
<9-27,Prof Crawley>才发现了它
<9-27,Prof Crawley>Through a Bornean rain forest,

363
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,960
<9-27,Prof Crawley>而我妻子却在家跟个穷酸的鸟类学家同居了
<9-27,Prof Crawley>While my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist

364
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,730
<9-27,Prof Crawley>那人住在艘帆船上  还喜欢穿牛仔喇叭裤
<9-27,Prof Crawley>Who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans!

365
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,330
<9-27,Prof Crawley>所以  我跟你说这就是只普通黑蟋蟀时
<9-27,Prof Crawley>So, when I tell you that it's a common field cricket,

366
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,900
<9-27,Prof Crawley>就是确凿无疑的[双关  bank当银行解]
<9-27,Prof Crawley>You can take that to the damn bank!

367
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,700
<9-27,Prof Crawley>上帝知道  我都不用跑银行了
<9-27,Prof Crawley>'Cause God knows I can't!

368
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,500
<9-27,Prof Crawley>那荡妇把我洗劫一空
<9-27,Prof Crawley>That tramp took me for everything!

369
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,630
<9-28,Sheldon>很显然  我错了
<9-28,Sheldon>Well, apparently, I was wrong.

370
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
<9-28,Sheldon>恭喜
<9-28,Sheldon>Congratulations.

371
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
<9-29,Raj>祝你在奥克斯纳德过得愉快
<9-29,Raj>Enjoy Oxnard.

372
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,160
<9-29,Raj>相信你女儿一直盼着你去
<9-29,Raj>I'm sure your daughter's looking forward to having you.

373
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,070
<10-1,Penny>谢尔顿
<10-1,Penny>Oh, hey, Sheldon.

374
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,900
<10-1,Penny>拿的什么  新漫画书
<10-1,Penny>What you got there? New comic book?

375
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,030
<10-2,Sheldon>旧漫画书
<10-2,Sheldon>Old comic book.

376
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,030
<10-2,Sheldon>刚从银行保管箱里取出来的
<10-2,Sheldon>I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.

377
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,070
<10-3,Penny>你要银行保管箱干嘛
<10-3,Penny>What do you have a safe deposit box for?

378
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,070
<10-4,Sheldon>存旧漫画书
<10-4,Sheldon>Old comic books.

379
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,230
<10-4,Sheldon>用一场考虑不充分的蟋蟀赌局后  我把这输给了沃罗威茨
<10-4,Sheldon>I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.

380
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,930
<10-5,Penny>什么  他们在玩蟋蟀电玩吗
<10-5,Penny>What, do they have Wii cricket now?

381
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,430
<10-5,Penny>这可不常见
<10-5,Penny>That can't be very popular.

382
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,630
<10-6,Sheldon>佩妮  我不想谈这些
<10-6,Sheldon>Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.

383
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,300
<10-7,Penny>看这能不能让你好受些
<10-7,Penny>Well, if it makes you feel any better,

384
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,800
<10-7,Penny>我也不觉得自己有多性感了
<10-7,Penny>I'm not feeling so hot either.

385
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,430
<10-8,Sheldon>为什么这会让我好受些
<10-8,Sheldon>Why would that make me feel better?

386
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,000
<10-9,Penny>我不知道  有共鸣
<10-9,Penny>I don't know, empathy?

387
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,100
<10-9,Penny>总之  我的意思是
<10-9,Penny>Anyway, I'm just saying,

388
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,100
<10-9,Penny>你因霍华德而觉得沮丧
<10-9,Penny>That you're feeling upset about something with Howard,

389
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,930
<10-9,Penny>-我也因莱纳德而心情不好  -对
<10-9,Penny>- And I'm upset about something with Leonard. - Yes

390
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,130
<10-10,Sheldon>不尽如人意的性爱
<10-10,Sheldon>Yes, the disappointing sex.

391
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,400
<10-10,Sheldon>这怎么能相提并论
<10-10,Sheldon>That's an inexact parallel.

392
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,030
<10-10,Sheldon>你和莱纳德总可以当回朋友
<10-10,Sheldon>You and Leonard can always return to being friends,

393
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,570
<10-10,Sheldon>我却再也不可能回到过去
<10-10,Sheldon>Whereas I can never return to a state

394
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,020
<10-10,Sheldon>回到被沃罗威茨像莱利太太家的鸡那样
<10-10,Sheldon>In which Wolowitz has not bested me

395
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,400
<10-11,Penny>狠狠地把我击败之前
<10-11,Penny>Like Mrs. Riley's chicken.

396
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,530
<10-11,Penny>什么莱利太太家的鸡
<10-11,Penny>What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?

397
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
<10-12,Sheldon>就是莱利太太家养的鸡嘛
<10-12,Sheldon>A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.

398
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,500
<10-13,Penny>好吧  忘了那些鸡吧
<10-13,Penny>Okay, forget the chicken.

399
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,900
<10-14,Sheldon>我倒也想
<10-14,Sheldon>Well, I wish I could.

400
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,500
<10-14,Sheldon>不  不
<10-14,Sheldon>No, no.

401
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,330
<10-15,Penny>关于我跟莱纳德你倒可能说对了
<10-15,Penny>You may be right about me and Leonard.

402
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,670
<10-16,Sheldon>我当然是对的
<10-16,Sheldon>Of course I'm right.

403
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,500
<10-16,Sheldon>我一周出错两次的几率能是多少
<10-16,Sheldon>What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?

404
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,870
<10-17,Penny>不  我是说  我们总可以做回朋友的
<10-17,Penny>No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.

405
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,970
<10-18,Sheldon>这话我刚说过了
<10-18,Sheldon>I just said that.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,500
<10-18,Sheldon>这对话又回到了原点  休会
<10-18,Sheldon>This conversation has started to circle.Meeting adjourned.

407
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,970
<11-2,Leonard>你怎么了
<11-2,Leonard>What's going on?

408
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,070
<11-3,Sheldon>你是想知道我今天的所有行程  好吧
<11-3,Sheldon>Oh,you'd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right

409
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,600
<11-3,Sheldon>我在银行等了半个小时
<11-3,Sheldon>Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank

410
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,200
<11-3,Sheldon>取了保管箱里的东西
<11-3,Sheldon>To get into my safe deposit box,

411
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,900
<11-3,Sheldon>然后被迫跟佩妮聊了你们的性生活问题
<11-3,Sheldon>I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems,

412
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,370
<11-3,Sheldon>对了  还有
<11-3,Sheldon>And, oh, yes,

413
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,370
<11-3,Sheldon>在一个充满了醍醐灌顶的时刻
<11-3,Sheldon>In a moment filled with biblical resonance,

414
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,430
<11-3,Sheldon>所谓骄者必败
<11-3,Sheldon>Pride wentth before my fall,

415
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,230
<11-3,Sheldon>我把第123期闪电侠输给了沃罗威茨
<11-3,Sheldon>Causing my Flash 123 to go with to Wolowitz.

416
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,470
<11-4,Leonard>等等
<11-4,Leonard>Wait a minute.

417
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,030
<11-4,Leonard>你跟佩妮谈起我们俩的性生活
<11-4,Leonard>You talked to Penny about our sex life?

418
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,870
<11-5,Sheldon>莱纳德  你不断地关注这些无关紧要的  真让我吃惊
<11-5,Sheldon>Leonard,it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial.

419
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,670
<11-5,Sheldon>我说我打赌输给沃罗威茨了
<11-5,Sheldon>I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

420
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,000
<11-6,Leonard>对的
<11-6,Leonard>Right, right.

421
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,600
<11-6,Leonard>你是说你跟佩妮谈话了
<11-6,Leonard>You're saying you talked to Penny?

422
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,930
<11-7,Sheldon>是的
<11-7,Sheldon>Ye-Yes.

423
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,670
<11-8,Leonard>很有趣
<11-8,Leonard>Interesting.

424
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
<11-9,Sheldon>怎么可能
<11-9,Sheldon>Hardly.

425
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,630
<11-10,Leonard>失陪
<11-10,Leonard>Excuse me.

426
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,100
<11-11,Sheldon>我又过分了吗
<11-11,Sheldon>Have I crossed some sort of line again?

427
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,130
<11-12,Leonard>有点
<11-12,Leonard>Little bit.

428
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,200
<11-13,Sheldon>谁在乎
<11-13,Sheldon>Oh, who cares?

429
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,160
<12-2,Leonard>谢尔顿跟你说什么了
<12-2,Leonard>Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?

430
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,200
<12-3,Penny>没说很多
<12-3,Penny>Not a lot.

431
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,600
<12-3,Penny>就说我们俩总可以回头做朋友的
<12-3,Penny>Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.

432
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,760
<12-4,Leonard>你想这样吗
<12-4,Leonard>Is that what you want?

433
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,060
<12-4,Leonard>我不知道
<12-4,Leonard>I don't know.

434
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,730
<12-5,Penny>但你不得不承认
<12-5,Penny>I mean, you have to admit

435
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,460
<12-5,Penny>我们只做朋友那会  一切都简单多了
<12-5,Penny>Things seemed simpler when we were just friends.

436
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,330
<12-6,Leonard>可能吧
<12-6,Leonard>I guess.

437
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,960
<12-7,Penny>那会减轻很多压力
<12-7,Penny>It would take the pressure off.

438
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,260
<12-8,Leonard>确实会  不是吗
<12-8,Leonard>It would, wouldn't it?

439
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,460
<12-9,Penny>所以  我们就做朋友吧
<12-9,Penny>So, we'll just be friends.

440
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,630
<12-10,Leonard>很好
<12-10,Leonard>Good.

441
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,060
<12-10,Leonard>很好
<12-10,Leonard>Good.

442
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,060
<12-11,Penny>过来
<12-11,Penny>Come here.

443
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,430
<12-11,Penny>一切都好
<12-11,Penny>Okay-dokay.
