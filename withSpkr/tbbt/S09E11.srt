00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,330

<2-3,Howard>They're not supposed to be available yet.

6
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,130

<2-10,Raj>-这样下去票会卖光的  -我们该怎么办
<2-10,Raj>- Guys, they're gonna sell out! - What are we gonna do?!

13
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,860
<2-12,Sheldon>好吧  虽然这违背我一直以来的信仰
<2-12,Sheldon>All right, this goes against everything I stand for,

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,420
<2-12,Sheldon>但走投无路  也只能出此下策
<2-12,Sheldon>but desperate times call for desperate measures.

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,760
<2-12,Sheldon>主啊

<2-12,Sheldon>我知道我这辈子一直在否认您的存在
<2-12,Sheldon>I know I've spent my life denying that you exist.

19
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,300
<2-14,Sheldon>-买到了  -我还会继续否认下去
<2-14,Sheldon>- Got 'em! - And I will continue to do so!

20
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,790
<2-14,Sheldon>翻译：最重要的大雕赛  最重要的小萌猫
<2-14,Sheldon>丁小七  猫中之王

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,930
<3-1,Penny>你跟艾米和好如初我好高兴
<3-1,Penny>I'm really happy you and Amy are back together.

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,890
<3-2,Sheldon>谢谢
<3-2,Sheldon>Oh, thank you.

33
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,010
<3-3,Leonard>我也很高兴  但我假装不了是为你高兴
<3-3,Leonard>I'm also really happy, but I can't pretend it's for you.

34
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,040
<3-3,Leonard>新星战电影三天后要上啦
<3-3,Leonard>New Star Wars in three days!

35
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,510
<3-4,Sheldon>鉴于周四还不能马上到来
<3-4,Sheldon>Hey, Thursday can't get here soon enough.

36
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,230
<3-4,Sheldon>我要请假不上班  在家看原作三部曲
<3-4,Sheldon>I'm taking off work to watch the original trilogy

37
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,410
<3-4,Sheldon>还要一边吃[掐死]伍基人星战谷麦片
<3-4,Sheldon>while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.

38
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,880
<3-5,Penny>亲爱的  你知道周四是艾米的生日吧
<3-5,Penny>Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy's birthday.

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,580
<3-6,Sheldon>那你也知道我买票的时候
<3-6,Sheldon>And you do realize I bought my ticket

40
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,720
<3-6,Sheldon>我跟艾米还没有复合呢
<3-6,Sheldon>when Amy and I were broken up?

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,580
<3-6,Sheldon>希望板子上没有你需要的东西了
<3-6,Sheldon>I hope you didn't need anything in that case,

42
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,380
<3-6,Sheldon>因为已经拍板定案了
<3-6,Sheldon>'cause it's closed.

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,880
<3-7,Penny>你们才刚刚复合
<3-7,Penny>You guys just got back together.

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,610
<3-7,Penny>她生日那天抛下她不太妙吧
<3-7,Penny>You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.

45
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,020
<3-8,Leonard>我觉得佩妮说得有道理  你可以改天看嘛
<3-8,Leonard>I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.

46
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,170
<3-9,Sheldon>但别人可能会剧透啊
<3-9,Sheldon>But someone might spoil the movie.

47
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,310
<3-9,Sheldon>但艾米的生日别人就没办法剧透
<3-9,Sheldon>No one can spoil Amy's birthday for me.

48
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,640
<3-9,Sheldon>"惊喜  她又老一岁了"
<3-9,Sheldon>Surprise! She's even older.

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,310
<3-9,Sheldon>真是"万万没想到"啊
<3-9,Sheldon>Who saw that coming?

50
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,750
<3-9,Sheldon>这话真"甜蜜"
<3-9,Sheldon>Oh, that's nice.

51
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,560
<3-10,Penny>写到她蛋糕上去吧
<3-10,Penny>Put that on her cake.

52
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,180
<4-1,Arthur>这下好  又来了
<4-1,Arthur>Oh, great. This again.

53
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,540
<4-2,Sheldon>亚瑟  什么风把你给吹来了
<4-2,Sheldon>Arthur, what brings you back?

54
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,760
<4-3,Arthur>你把我问倒了  我...
<4-3,Arthur>Uh, beats me. I-I just...

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,070
<4-3,Arthur>只希望入的不是春梦
<4-3,Arthur>hope this isn't a-a sex dream.

56
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,070
<4-4,Sheldon>过去你曾在我
<4-4,Sheldon>In the past, you've come to me

57
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,470
<4-4,Sheldon>碰到困境的时候来指点迷津
<4-4,Sheldon>when I'm struggling with a dilemma.

58
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,580
<4-5,Arthur>还有一次是在你晚上害怕
<4-5,Arthur>And-and the one time where... where you were afraid,

59
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,500
<4-5,Arthur>需要我来...  当夜灯
<4-5,Arthur>and you needed me for... for a night light.

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,390
<4-5,Arthur>什么事困扰到你了
<4-5,Arthur>What's-what's troubling you?

61
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,740
<4-6,Sheldon>我的小伙伴们跟我说
<4-6,Sheldon>My friends are telling me

62
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,540
<4-6,Sheldon>我不应该在女朋友生日时抛下她
<4-6,Sheldon>I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend on her birthday

63
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,940
<4-6,Sheldon>跑去看新的《星球大战》
<4-6,Sheldon>to see the new Star Wars movie.

64
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,600
<4-7,Arthur>感觉说得没错啊
<4-7,Arthur>Well, sounds right.

65
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,870
<4-7,Arthur>我能脱下这身...
<4-7,Arthur>Can... can I get out of this...

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,780
<4-7,Arthur>夏威夷妇女穆穆袍了吗
<4-7,Arthur>muumuu now?

67
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,910
<4-8,Sheldon>这是绝地武士的袍子
<4-8,Sheldon>Those are the robes of the Jedi,

68
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,210
<4-8,Sheldon>是银河系和平与正义的守护者呢
<4-8,Sheldon>the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.

69
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,290
<4-9,Arthur>他们...  他们都不穿小内内
<4-9,Arthur>And they... they-they don't wear underwear.

70
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,960
<4-10,Sheldon>所以你也同意他们的话
<4-10,Sheldon>So, you agree with my friends

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,460
<4-10,Sheldon>我不应该去看首映吗
<4-10,Sheldon>that I should skip the premiere?

72
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,390
<4-11,Arthur>你爱那个女孩吗
<4-11,Arthur>Uh, do... do you love this girl?

73
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,830
<4-11,Arthur>爱
<4-11,Arthur>Yes.

74
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,470
<4-12,Sheldon>但她知道《星球大战》对我有多重要
<4-12,Sheldon>But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.

75
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,850
<4-13,Arthur>或许你应该证明给她看看
<4-13,Arthur>Well, maybe you should show her how...

76
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,970
<4-13,Arthur>她在你心中到底多重要
<4-13,Arthur>how important she is to you.

77
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,340
<4-14,Sheldon>其方式是看她希望我看的电影吗
<4-14,Sheldon>By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?

78
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,550
<4-15,Arthur>谢尔顿  你有数不清的时间能看这电影
<4-15,Arthur>Sheldon, you-you can see this movie whenever you want.

79
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,090
<4-15,Arthur>但你能跟这女孩在一起的时间
<4-15,Arthur>But you only have a limited number of days

80
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,110
<4-15,Arthur>却是有限的
<4-15,Arthur>that you-you can be with this woman.

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,720
<4-15,Arthur>陪她吧
<4-15,Arthur>Be with her.

82
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,200
<4-16,Sheldon>你说得对
<4-16,Sheldon>You're right.

83
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,810
<4-17,Arthur>太好了
<4-17,Arthur>Great.

84
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,420
<4-18,Sheldon>你要上哪去
<4-18,Sheldon>Where are you going?

85
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,480
<4-18,Sheldon>我不知道
<4-18,Sheldon>I don't know,

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,650
<4-19,Arthur>但希望是一个我能穿裤子的地方
<4-19,Arthur>but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.

87
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,320
<5-1,Amy (answering phone)>谢尔顿  怎么了
<5-1,Amy (answering phone)>Sheldon, what's wrong?

88
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,130
<5-2,Sheldon>我想让你知道我会陪你过生日
<5-2,Sheldon>I wanted to let you know I'll be spending your birthday with you.

89
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,260
<5-3,Amy>好的
<5-3,Amy>Okay.

90
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,270

<5-4,Sheldon>See, I-I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night,

91
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,660
<5-4,Sheldon>可质子教授入我的梦  身上还穿着
<5-4,Sheldon>but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as

92
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,450
<5-4,Sheldon>绝地武士欧比旺·肯诺比的衣服来劝我陪你
<5-4,Sheldon>Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.

93
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,290
<5-5,Amy>欧比啥
<5-5,Amy>Obi-what?

94

<5-6,Sheldon>不打扰你了  你先回去睡吧  晚安
<5-6,Sheldon>I'll-I'll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.

<5-7,Amy>Wait. Um, Sheldon,

97
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,040

<5-8,Sheldon>时间晚了  要睡了  再见
<5-8,Sheldon>It's late. Got to go. Bye.

99
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,750
<6-1,Raj>谢尔顿决定陪艾米过生日  这事得点个赞
<6-1,Raj>Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.

100
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,550
<6-1,Raj>对啊
<6-1,Raj>I know.

101
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,820
<6-2,Leonard>去看电影时少了他还是会有点怪
<6-2,Leonard>It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.

102
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,210
<6-3,Howard>我们可以多等两天  等他一起看啊
<6-3,Howard>Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.

103
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,680
<6-4,Sheldon>你们好啊

<6-8,Sheldon (to Howard)>这是我《星球大战》的电影票

<6-6,Sheldon>I don't have to tell you it is worth far more

110
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,380
<6-6,Sheldon>远远超过面额上的15.5美元
<6-6,Sheldon>than its face value of $15.50.

<7-11,Sheldon>in helping me select the perfect gift.

134
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,900
<7-12,Bernadette>当然可以
<7-12,Bernadette>Sure.

135
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,460
<7-13,Sheldon>目前为止我有三个想法
<7-13,Sheldon>Well, so far, I've come up with three ideas.

136
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,000
<7-13,Sheldon>第一个是一个跟洛杉矶爱乐管弦乐团
<7-13,Sheldon>The first is a chance for her to play the harp

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,780
<7-13,Sheldon>演奏竖琴的机会
<7-13,Sheldon>with the L.A. Philharmonic.

138
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,460
<7-14,Penny>哇  你真的能安排这事吗
<7-14,Penny>Wow. You can really arrange that?

139
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,170
<7-15,Sheldon>机会嘛  可能有也可能没有
<7-15,Sheldon>Well, I said a chance, you know.

140
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,120
<7-15,Sheldon>你跟连锁餐厅说今天是自己生日
<7-15,Sheldon>When you tell them it's your birthday at Bennigan's,

141
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,770
<7-15,Sheldon>他们也会大开方便之门
<7-15,Sheldon>they make a fuss.

142
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,240
<7-15,Sheldon>我觉得洛杉矶爱乐管弦乐团也会这样吧
<7-15,Sheldon>I don't see why the Philharmonic would be any different.

143
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,510
<7-16,Bernadette>不如来点实际的
<7-16,Bernadette>How about something a little more realistic?

144
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,830
<7-17,Sheldon>艾米喜欢自己织毛衣
<7-17,Sheldon>Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters,

145
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,860
<7-17,Sheldon>我在想自掏腰包赞助她去参加
<7-17,Sheldon>so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip

146
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,910
<7-17,Sheldon>威斯康辛州羊及羊毛节
<7-17,Sheldon>to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.

147
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,930
<7-18,Penny>抱歉  我刚才在等你说"逗你玩"
<7-18,Penny>Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.

148
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,040
<7-19,Bernadette>等等  那也可以很浪漫啊
<7-19,Bernadette>Hold on. It could be romantic.

149
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,260
<7-19,Bernadette>他们俩一起远离尘嚣
<7-19,Bernadette>The two of them away together,

150
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,580
<7-19,Bernadette>在白雪皑皑的威斯康辛州相互取暖
<7-19,Bernadette>keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.

151
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,250
<7-20,Sheldon>不不不  她自己去而已
<7-20,Sheldon>No, no, no, no. She'd be going alone.

152
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,580
<7-20,Sheldon>如果你们觉得我很怕鸟
<7-20,Sheldon>Well, if you think I'm afraid of birds,

153
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,290
<7-20,Sheldon>那真该看看我遇到羊会怎么样
<7-20,Sheldon>you should see me around sheep.

154
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,380
<7-21,Penny>好吧  第三个选项是什么
<7-21,Penny>Okay, well, what's the third option?

155
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,450
<7-22,Sheldon>我跟她交媾
<7-22,Sheldon>That I have coitus with her.

156
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,750
<8-1,Leonard>你们觉得把谢尔顿的票给斯尔图特怎么样
<8-1,Leonard>What do you think about giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?

157
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,820
<8-1,Leonard>不知道
<8-1,Leonard>I don't know.

158
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,150
<8-2,Raj>你们跟斯尔图特一起看过电影吗
<8-2,Raj>Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?

159
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,440
<8-3,Howard>感觉就像跟自己爷爷去看电影
<8-3,Howard>It's like going with your grandpa.

160
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,130
<8-3,Howard>不吃爆米花
<8-3,Howard>Instead of eating popcorn,

161
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,560
<8-3,Howard>他自带保鲜盒装的鸡肉片
<8-3,Howard>he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware

162
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,520
<8-3,Howard>还有保温瓶盛满了热汤
<8-3,Howard>and a thermos full of soup.

163
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,010
<8-4,Leonard>他没那么糟啦
<8-4,Leonard>He's not that bad.

164
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,040
<8-4,Leonard>斯尔图特  你周四晚上有事吗
<8-4,Leonard>Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?

165
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,950
<8-5,Stuart>我的医生担心我的血液循环
<8-5,Stuart>My, uh... my doctor's worried about my circulation,

166
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,240
<8-5,Stuart>所以我本来打算去商场走走
<8-5,Stuart>so I was thinking about walking around the mall.

167
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,010
<8-6,Leonard>怎么了
<8-6,Leonard>Why?

168
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,450
<8-7,Wil Wheaton>你们好啊
<8-7,Wil Wheaton>Hey, you guys.

169
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,950
<8-8,Howard>记得穿舒服点的鞋子哦
<8-8,Howard>Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes.

170
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,360
<8-8,Howard>威尔  周四想一起去看《星球大战》吗
<8-8,Howard>Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?

171
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,780
<8-9,Wil>当然好啊
<8-9,Wil>Absolutely.

172
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,250
<8-10,Stuart>好啊  带威尔去吧
<8-10,Stuart>Fine, take Wil.

173
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,570
<8-10,Stuart>看他会不会给你们带蛤蜊浓汤
<8-10,Stuart>See if he brings you clam chowder.

174
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,340
<9-1,Penny>好吧  好吧
<9-1,Penny>Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

175
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,740
<9-1,Penny>我们...我们再过一遍所有选项
<9-1,Penny>Let's-let's... let's just recap our options.

176
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,500
<9-1,Penny>有竖琴演奏  绵羊织毛
<9-1,Penny>All right, we've got harp thing, sheep thing...

177
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,390
<9-2,Bernadette>狂野做爱
<9-2,Bernadette>Wild thang.

178
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,040
<9-3,Sheldon>你们觉得她最喜欢哪一个
<9-3,Sheldon>Which do you think she'd prefer?

179
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,800
<9-3,Sheldon>因为我查过羊及羊毛节的官网
<9-3,Sheldon>Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site,

180
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,260
<9-3,Sheldon>只剩8千张票了
<9-3,Sheldon>and there's only 8,000 tickets left.

181
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,240
<9-4,Penny>谢尔顿  跟艾米发生肉体关系可是重大的一步啊
<9-4,Penny>Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.

182
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,090
<9-5,Bernadette>是啊  你准备好了吗
<9-5,Bernadette>Yeah, are you ready for this?

183
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,980
<9-6,Sheldon>任何形式的亲密对我来说都是挑战
<9-6,Sheldon>Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me,

184
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,720
<9-6,Sheldon>但我想向她证明她对我有多重要
<9-6,Sheldon>but I'd like to show her how important she is,

185
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,360
<9-6,Sheldon>而我感觉现在就是最好的时机
<9-6,Sheldon>and it feels like now might be the right time.

186
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,540
<9-7,Penny>谢尔顿  这理由太美了
<9-7,Penny>Sheldon, that's so beautiful.

187
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,880
<9-8,Sheldon>那就这么定了
<9-8,Sheldon>Then it's settled.

188
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,960
<9-8,Sheldon>艾米的生日礼物就是我的生殖器
<9-8,Sheldon>Amy's birthday present will be my genitals.

189
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,140
<10-1,Amy>多谢你们带我出去
<10-1,Amy>Thanks for taking me out.

190
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,950
<10-2,Penny>既然你的生日要跟谢尔顿一起过
<10-2,Penny>Well, you're spending your birthday with Sheldon.

191
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,320
<10-2,Penny>何不跟我们提前庆祝呢
<10-2,Penny>Why not celebrate early?

192
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,560
<10-3,Bernadette>你想去哪里
<10-3,Bernadette>So where do you want to go?

193
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,080
<10-4,Amy>我听说格林路上那间新的墨西哥餐厅不错
<10-4,Amy>I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.

194
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,780
<10-5,Penny>好啊
<10-5,Penny>Sure, sure.

195
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,810
<10-5,Penny>或者我们可以带你去做比基尼蜜蜡脱毛
<10-5,Penny>Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.

196
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,170
<10-6,Amy>为什么我生日要做比基尼蜜蜡脱毛
<10-6,Amy>Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?

197
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,610
<10-7,Penny>不知道  我就随口一说
<10-7,Penny>Uh, I don't know. It was just a thought.

198
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,740
<10-8,Amy>我觉得还是去吃墨西哥菜好了
<10-8,Amy>I think I'll just stick to Mexican.

199
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,170
<10-9,Bernadette>很好  吃完以后我们可以去看部小黄片
<10-9,Bernadette>Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie,

200
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,770
<10-9,Bernadette>如果有人对怎么回事或怎么做有疑问
<10-9,Bernadette>and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how,

201
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,380
<10-9,Bernadette>我们可以负责解答
<10-9,Bernadette>we can answer them.

202
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,390
<10-10,Amy>好吧  到底怎么回事
<10-10,Amy>Okay, what is going on?

203
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,920
<10-11,Penny>我们只是希望你对
<10-11,Penny>Oh, we just want you to be prepared

204
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,690
<10-11,Penny>明天可能发生的惊喜做好准备
<10-11,Penny>for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.

205
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,860
<10-12,Amy>什么惊喜
<10-12,Amy>What surprises?

206
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,110
<10-13,Bernadette>我们不想剧透坏了惊喜
<10-13,Bernadette>We don't want to spoil anything,

207
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,370
<10-13,Bernadette>但谢尔顿说
<10-13,Bernadette>but you should know that

208
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,700
<10-13,Bernadette>他做好跟你发生肉体关系的准备了
<10-13,Bernadette>Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.

209
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,480
<10-14,Amy>你们少他妈逗我玩
<10-14,Amy>You shut your damn mouth!

210
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,560
<10-14,Amy>你们真的听到他这么说了吗
<10-14,Amy>You actually heard him say this?

211
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,920
<10-15,Penny>是的  他说了他想做点什么
<10-15,Penny>Yes. He said he wants to do something

212
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,860
<10-15,Penny>来证明你对他有多重要
<10-15,Penny>to show you how much you mean to him.

213
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,650
<10-16,Amy>真不敢相信
<10-16,Amy>I-I can't believe it. I...

214
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,730
<10-18,Amy>我不知道该说什么了
<10-18,Amy>I don't know what to say.

215
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,010
<10-17,Bernadette>我们很为你高兴
<10-17,Bernadette>Well, we're really happy for you,

216
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,120
<10-17,Bernadette>我们都知道他多看重...
<10-17,Bernadette>and we know how much he cares...

217
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,000
<10-18,Amy>我知道说什么了  快给我下体除毛
<10-18,Amy>I do know what to say! Let's get me waxed!

218
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,940
<11-1,Arthur>为什么永远都不是安吉·迪金森的卧室
<11-1,Arthur>Why isn't it ever Angie Dickinson's bedroom?

220
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,000
<11-2,Sheldon>你回来了
<11-2,Sheldon>You're back.

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,560
<11-3,Arthur>这似乎不是我能决定的
<11-3,Arthur>It-it doesn't seem like it's up to me.

222
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,870
<11-4,Sheldon>我猜你来是因为
<11-4,Sheldon>I suppose you're here because...

223
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,940
<11-4,Sheldon>我决定跟我的女朋友发生肉体关系了
<11-4,Sheldon>I've decided to be physical with my girlfriend,

224
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,030
<11-4,Sheldon>而我以前从来没有做过
<11-4,Sheldon>and I've never done that before.

225
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,970
<11-5,Arthur>稍等一下
<11-5,Arthur>E-Excuse me for a moment.

226
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,180
<11-5,Arthur>至少努力过了
<11-5,Arthur>Well, it was worth a shot.

227
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,320
<11-6,Sheldon>所以你能帮我吗
<11-6,Sheldon>So, can you help me?

228
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,060
<11-7,Arthur>好吧
<11-7,Arthur>Uh, all right. Um...

229
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,730
<11-7,Arthur>当一个男人
<11-7,Arthur>once-once the man gets

230
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,230
<11-7,Arthur>把一个女人的灯笼内裤脱掉
<11-7,Arthur>the-the woman out of her... out of her bloomers...

231
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,010
<11-8,Sheldon>不  不是那个
<11-8,Sheldon>Oh, no. Not that.

232
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,080
<11-8,Sheldon>我知道"做"法
<11-8,Sheldon>I-I understand the mechanics.

233
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
<11-9,Arthur>很好  因为...
<11-9,Arthur>Oh, good, good. 'Cause, uh,

234
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,270
<11-9,Arthur>我完全不知道现在的孩子们
<11-9,Arthur>I have no idea what kids these days are...

235
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,740
<11-9,Arthur>都怎么称呼他们的"部位"
<11-9,Arthur>calling their-their parts.

236
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,350
<11-10,Sheldon>他们好像是说"大屌"[垃圾]
<11-10,Sheldon>I think they say "junk".

237
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,200
<11-11,Arthur>这世界到底怎么了
<11-11,Arthur>What is happening to this world?

238
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,730
<11-11,Arthur>你究竟想知道什么
<11-11,Arthur>What-what do you actually need to know?

239
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,810
<11-12,Sheldon>那一晚将对我俩来说都很重要
<11-12,Sheldon>This is an important night for us,

240
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,010
<11-12,Sheldon>我有点担心自己会太紧张
<11-12,Sheldon>and I'm worried I might be overwhelmed

241
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,190
<11-12,Sheldon>然后搞砸了
<11-12,Sheldon>and ruin everything.

242
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,800
<11-13,Arthur>谢尔顿  如果对方是对的人
<11-13,Arthur>Sheldon, if-if you're with the right person,

243
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,340
<11-13,Arthur>一切都会水到渠成
<11-13,Arthur>it-it'll be okay.

244
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,520
<11-14,Sheldon>谢谢你  亚瑟
<11-14,Sheldon>Thank you, Arthur.

245
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,350
<11-14,Sheldon>你是世界上最有智慧的人
<11-14,Sheldon>You are the wisest of the wise.

246
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,820
<11-15,Arthur>很高兴你能这么说
<11-15,Arthur>Well, that's-that's very nice of you to say,

247
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,550
<11-15,Arthur>可我觉得我只不过是
<11-15,Arthur>but I think I'm just an expression of...

248
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,530
<11-15,Arthur>你潜意识的映射
<11-15,Arthur>of your unconscious mind.

280
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,280
<14-5,Sheldon>可是它飞走了  我追了好久
<14-5,Sheldon>but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.

287
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,150
<14-9,Sheldon>有点吓人
<14-9,Sheldon>It's kind of spooky.

288
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,320
<14-10,Amy>我可以换回原样
<14-10,Amy>I can change it back.

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,400
<14-11,Sheldon>只要面具杀人魔杰森别突然跳出来就好
<14-11,Sheldon>As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.

291
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,950
<14-11,Sheldon>所以...

<14-13,Sheldon>我本来想带你去吃一顿生日大餐
<14-13,Sheldon>I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner.

294
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,340
<14-13,Sheldon>如果选个东边的餐厅  说不定还能把气球找回来
<14-13,Sheldon>If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.

295
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,330
<14-14,Amy>听起来不错  可是...
<14-14,Amy>Um, that sounds nice, but...

00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,140
<14-14,Amy>我现在不是很饿
<14-14,Amy>I'm not really hungry right now.

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,990
<14-14,Amy>我想咱们不如...
<14-14,Amy>I thought maybe...

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,750
<14-15,Sheldon>关于这件礼物  我有些事要先告诉你
<14-15,Sheldon>I should probably tell you something about this gift.

301
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,260
<14-16,Amy>你是说在你...
<14-16,Amy>You mean before you...

<14-19,Sheldon>-当然  -为什么我们要把
<14-19,Sheldon>- Of course. - Why are we saying

307
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,520
<14-19,Sheldon>"给你"说得这么诡异
<14-19,Sheldon>"give it to you" like that?

308
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,800
<14-19,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<14-19,Sheldon>Sheldon,

313
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,120
<14-21,Sheldon>抱歉  如今这社会动不动就告上法庭
<14-21,Sheldon>I'm sorry, but this is a litigious society.

314
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,510
<14-21,Sheldon>我需要你的口头同意
<14-21,Sheldon>I'm gonna need verbal consent.

315
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,890
<14-22,Amy>求之不得
<14-22,Amy>Yes.

316
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,970
<14-23,Sheldon>我还是上网下载一个简易合同吧
<14-23,Sheldon>You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.

317
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,410
<15-1,Leonard>如果你不喜欢《星球大战》  那你干嘛还来呢
<15-1,Leonard>So, if you don't like Star Wars, why are you here?

318
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,760
<15-2,Wil>我只是图一乐
<15-2,Wil>Oh, I'm just having fun.

319
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,460
<15-2,Wil>每个人都对这电影这么认真看待
<15-2,Wil>Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously.

320
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,220
<15-2,Wil>就好像电影拍砸了  他们的人生也就毁了
<15-2,Wil>Like if the movie's bad, it's gonna ruin their lives.

321
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,250
<15-3,Raj>电影拍砸了吗  你听说了什么吗
<15-3,Raj>Is it bad? Did you hear something?

<15-3,Raj>亲娘耶  拍砸了  谁赶紧来杀了我吧
<15-3,Raj>Oh, my God. It's bad. Somebody kill me.

<15-4,Wil>See? That's what I mean.

324
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,280
<15-4,Wil>当你明早从晨光中醒来
<15-4,Wil>When you wake up in the morning, whether this is

325
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,630
<15-4,Wil>不管这电影是神作一部  还是狗屎一坨
<15-4,Wil>the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap,

326
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,400
<15-4,Wil>你的生活都不会有任何改变
<15-4,Wil>your life isn't gonna change at all.

<15-5,Howard>他说得对

<15-6,Leonard>我们明天都会再来看一遍
<15-6,Leonard>we're coming back tomorrow to watch it again.

331
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,820
<16-1,Bernadette>你觉得谢尔顿真的会跟艾米滚成床单吗
<16-1,Bernadette>Do you think Sheldon's actually gonna go through with it?

332
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,680
<16-1,Bernadette>我不知道
<16-1,Bernadette>I don't know.

333
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,010
<16-2,Penny>他说他已经准备好了
<16-2,Penny>He said he's ready.

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,600
<16-3,Bernadette>今年一定有勇气把南瓜内瓤掏出来呢
<16-3,Bernadette>he'd be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.

336
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,740
<16-4,Penny>我对谢尔顿有信心  我们聊过了
<16-4,Penny>Well, I'm gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked.

337
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,280
<16-4,Penny>我告诉他女生的喜好  他咯咯傻笑了一阵后
<16-4,Penny>I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling,

338
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,350
<16-4,Penny>看起来相当有自信
<16-4,Penny>he seemed pretty sure of himself.
