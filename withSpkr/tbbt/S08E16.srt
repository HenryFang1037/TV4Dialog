1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,190
<1-1,Amy>我刚在书上看到一个实验
<1-1,Amy>I just read about an experiment

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,120
<1-1,Amy>为测试是否能让两个人
<1-1,Amy>designed to see if you could make two people fall

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,850
<1-1,Amy>在几小时内爱上彼此而设
<1-1,Amy>in love in a matter of hours.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,400
<1-2,Leonard>听起来不太对啊
<1-2,Leonard>That doesn't sound right.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,780
<1-2,Leonard>我的研究结果显示  这需要3到5年的
<1-2,Leonard>My research has shown that it takes three to five years

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,020
<1-2,Leonard>厚脸皮苦求
<1-2,Leonard>of shameless begging.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,370
<1-3,Penny>亲爱的  这事说出来  咱俩都不光彩
<1-3,Penny>Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,720
<1-4,Raj>我  我...
<1-4,Raj>Yeah, I-I...

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,760
<1-4,Raj>我有看到你说的那篇文章
<1-4,Raj>I saw that article you're talking about.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,770
<1-4,Raj>参与者互问对方一系列
<1-4,Raj>Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions

11
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,700
<1-4,Raj>能增加亲密度的问题
<1-4,Raj>designed to promote intimacy.

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,020
<1-5,Amy>在最后结束前
<1-5,Amy>And then they finish it off by staring

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,720
<1-5,Amy>还要凝视彼此双眼四分钟
<1-5,Amy>into each other's eyes for four minutes.

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,330
<1-6,Sheldon>这真是狗屁不通
<1-6,Sheldon>Oh, that's nonsense.

15
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,300
<1-6,Sheldon>我敢说我爱你
<1-6,Sheldon>I proclaimed my love for you.

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,970
<1-6,Sheldon>可上一次我看着你的双眼
<1-6,Sheldon>And the last time I looked into your eyes

17
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,990
<1-6,Sheldon>是因为你觉得自己得了结膜炎
<1-6,Sheldon>was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,120
<1-7,Amy>虽然我的确是得了结膜炎
<1-7,Amy>Other than the fact that I had it,

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,840
<1-7,Amy>但那也真是个浪漫之夜啊
<1-7,Amy>that was a magical night.

20
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,350
<1-8,Penny>拉杰  你会跟艾米丽做这样的实验吗
<1-8,Penny>Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?

21
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,890
<1-9,Raj>我才不需要靠科学来赢得她芳心
<1-9,Raj>What? I don't need science to win her heart.

22
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,090
<1-9,Raj>有我家的钱就够了
<1-9,Raj>I have my family's wealth for that.

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,890
<1-10,Leonard>相信我  几个小时是无法造就爱的吧
<1-10,Leonard>I'm telling you, you can't create love in a few hours.

24
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,170
<1-11,Penny>-对吧  -话别说太满
<1-11,Penny>- Right? - Oh, careful.

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,660
<1-11,Penny>你这是在质疑整个《非诚勿扰》节目核心
<1-11,Penny>You're poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.

26
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,260
<1-12,Sheldon>我们不需要在这上面辩论啊
<1-12,Sheldon>Yeah, but we don't have to debate this.

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,290
<1-12,Sheldon>我们是科学家
<1-12,Sheldon>We're scientists.

28
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,340
<1-12,Sheldon>我们能自己做实验
<1-12,Sheldon>We can conduct our own research.

29
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,630
<1-12,Sheldon>我提议我们囚禁两个流浪汉
<1-12,Sheldon>Yeah, I propose that we imprison two street people.

30
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,800
<1-13,Amy>-不行  -然后...
<1-13,Amy>- No. - And...

31
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,960
<1-14,Sheldon>你都还没让我说完呢
<1-14,Sheldon>You didn't even let me finish.

32
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,110
<1-15,Amy>别闹了
<1-15,Amy>Forget it!

33
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,100
<1-16,Sheldon>所以你爱咋实验猩猩就咋实验
<1-16,Sheldon>So, you can experiment on all the apes you want.

34
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,240
<1-16,Sheldon>但如果是我想操控两个被囚禁人类的情绪
<1-16,Sheldon>But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings,

35
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,460
<1-16,Sheldon>我就瞬间成了大魔王是吗
<1-16,Sheldon>suddenly I'm the monster.

36
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,160
<1-17,Raj>为什么你不自己做这测试呢
<1-17,Raj>Why don't you just do the test?

37
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,040
<1-18,Sheldon>为了科学  我很乐意
<1-18,Sheldon>In the interest of science, I'd be willing to.

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,910
<1-19,Penny>什么  你会愿意接受一场你得回答
<1-19,Penny>What? You're okay with an experiment where you have

39
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,730
<1-19,Penny>最深层内心想法的尴尬问题的实验吗
<1-19,Penny>to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?

40
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,030
<1-20,Sheldon>是啊
<1-20,Sheldon>Yes.

41
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,480
<1-21,Penny>拜托拜托  让我跟他做这实验
<1-21,Penny>Please, can I do it with him? Please?!

42
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,210
<1-22,Leonard>我听了谢尔顿对人事物的感受足足十年了
<1-22,Leonard>I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings on things for ten years.

43
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,510
<1-22,Leonard>换人  你上场吧
<1-22,Leonard>Tag, you're it.

44
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,560
<1-23,Raj>万一实验成功了怎么办
<1-23,Raj>Yeah, but what if the experiment works?

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,300
<1-24,Penny>我不会爱上谢尔顿
<1-24,Penny>I'm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.

46
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
<1-25,Amy>我当年也这么说
<1-25,Amy>That's what I said.

47
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,930
<1-25,Amy>结果他以迅雷不及掩耳之势
<1-25,Amy>Before I knew it, he pontificated his way

48
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,110
<1-25,Amy>霸道地侵占了我的心
<1-25,Amy>right into my heart.

49
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,820
<1-26,Sheldon>有趣小知识  "霸道"
<1-26,Sheldon>Uh, fun fact-- "pontificate"

50
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,740
<1-26,Sheldon>是来自拉丁文里的"教皇"
<1-26,Sheldon>comes from the Latin word "pontifex,"

51
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,870
<1-26,Sheldon>有着"造桥人"或"教皇"的意思
<1-26,Sheldon>which means "bridge builder" or "pope."

52
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,180
<1-27,Leonard>爱上了吗
<1-27,Leonard>In love yet?

59
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,760
<2-1,Sheldon>佩妮  我就好奇
<2-1,Sheldon>Just out of curiosity, Penny,

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,070
<2-1,Sheldon>如果这个实验真让我们坠入了爱河
<2-1,Sheldon>if this experiment does make us fall in love,

61
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,270
<2-1,Sheldon>你会愿意载我去威斯康星州的日内瓦湖城
<2-1,Sheldon>would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin

62
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,600
<2-1,Sheldon>参加加里大会吗
<2-1,Sheldon>for Gary Con?

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,370
<2-1,Sheldon>这是唯一一个庆祝
<2-1,Sheldon>It's the only convention celebrating

64
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,690
<2-1,Sheldon>加里·吉盖克斯的一生与成就的大会
<2-1,Sheldon>the life and work of Gary Gygax,

65
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,530
<2-1,Sheldon>他是《龙与地下城》[桌游]的创始者之一
<2-1,Sheldon>the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.

66
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,050
<2-1,Sheldon>其实呢  我诚心告诉你
<2-1,Sheldon>You know what? I can honestly say

67
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,420
<2-2,Penny>如果我们爱上对方  我不止会载你去那里
<2-2,Penny>if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there,

68
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,020
<2-2,Penny>我还会买所有你想要的龙T恤给你
<2-2,Penny>I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.

69
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,560
<2-3,Sheldon>来吧  宝贝儿  咱们来吧
<2-3,Sheldon>Okay, babe, let's do this.

70
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,380
<3-1,Raj>你们真的能这么冷静面对
<3-1,Raj>You guys are really being calm

71
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,610
<3-1,Raj>佩妮与谢尔顿做这个实验的事吗
<3-1,Raj>about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing.

72
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,740
<3-1,Raj>如果我是你们
<3-1,Raj>If it were me,

73
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,290
<3-1,Raj>我就会有点紧张
<3-1,Raj>I-I'd be a little nervous.

74
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:11,940
<3-2,Amy>为什么
<3-2,Amy>Why?

75
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,950
<3-3,Raj>就算那研究只是胡扯
<3-3,Raj>Well, even if the study's nonsense,

76
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,170
<3-3,Raj>我这个人还是不敢拼人品
<3-3,Raj>I-I don't believe in tempting fate.

77
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,860
<3-3,Raj>所以我也不愿意用碟仙板
<3-3,Raj>Same reason I wouldn't use a Ouija board,

78
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,320
<3-3,Raj>或者招惹亚洲人
<3-3,Raj>or pick a fight with an Asian guy.

79
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,430
<3-3,Raj>虽然他应该不会空手道  但是...
<3-3,Raj>He probably doesn't know karate, but...

80
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,960
<3-3,Raj>干嘛冒险呢
<3-3,Raj>why risk it?

81
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,370
<3-4,Amy>我想我们没啥好担心的
<3-4,Amy>I think we're safe.

82
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,780
<3-5,Raj>李小龙高中里的小混混也是这么想啊
<3-5,Raj>Well, that's what the bullies at Bruce Lee's high school thought.

83
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,920
<3-5,Raj>结果咧  哇哒
<3-5,Raj>And then, bam!

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,710
<3-5,Raj>空手道
<3-5,Raj>Karate.

85
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,660
<3-6,Leonard>我们就干坐在这里等他们做完实验吗
<3-6,Leonard>Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?

86
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,350
<3-7,Amy>我跟你也可以做啊
<3-7,Amy>The two of us could do it.

87
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,840
<3-8,Leonard>行啊  应该挺好玩的
<3-8,Leonard>Yeah, sure, that might be fun.

88
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,970
<3-9,Amy>第一个问题是什么
<3-9,Amy>What's the first question?

89
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,630
<3-10,Raj>稍等
<3-10,Raj>Hang on.

90
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,960
<3-10,Raj>好的
<3-10,Raj>Okay.

91
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,610
<3-10,Raj>"如果可以跟世上任何人共进晚餐
<3-10,Raj>"Given the choice of anyone in the world,

92
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,380
<3-11,Leonard>你会选择谁呢"
<3-11,Leonard>whom would you want as a dinner guest?"

93
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,640
<3-12,Amy>我真心会选佩妮
<3-12,Amy>I can honestly say Penny.

94
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,210
<3-12,Amy>那我会选清洁工
<3-12,Amy>Then I choose a janitor.

95
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,700
<3-12,Amy>因为我要吐了
<3-12,Amy>'Cause I'm about to throw up.

96
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,310
<3-12,Amy>我恋爱了
<3-12,Amy>I'm in love.

97
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,070
<3-13,Leonard>来做点别的吧
<3-13,Leonard>Let's do something else.

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,550
<3-14,Raj>艾米丽快下班了
<3-14,Raj>Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon.

<3-14,Raj>我们四个人可以一起出去玩啊
<3-14,Raj>Why don't the four of us go out?

100
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,950
<3-16,Amy>-行啊  -听起来不错
<3-16,Amy>- Okay. - Sounds good.

101

<3-17,Leonard>我们要打电话问问霍华德跟伯纳黛特吗
<3-17,Leonard>Should we call Howard and Bernadette?

102
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,040
<3-18,Raj>我不知道他们什么时候下机
<3-18,Raj>I don't know what time their plane gets in,

103
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,150
<3-18,Raj>不过我发条短信问问看吧
<3-18,Raj>but let me, let me shoot them a text.

104
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,350
<3-19,Amy>他有说葬礼怎么样吗
<3-19,Amy>Did he say anything about the funeral?

105
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,500
<3-20,Raj>没怎么说  不过感觉他挺好的
<3-20,Raj>Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.

106
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,620
<4-1,Howard>开什么玩笑
<4-1,Howard>Are you kidding me?!

107
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,930
<4-1,Howard>你们居然把我妈的骨灰弄丢了
<4-1,Howard>You lost my mother's ashes?!

108
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,620
<4-2,Baggage Clerk>不是  我只是说有时候行李会被转错地方
<4-2,Baggage Clerk>No, I-I'm just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.

109
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,560
<4-3,Howard>好吧  行  那这世上
<4-3,Howard>All right, fine. Where did you misroute

110
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,450
<4-3,Howard>唯一爱过我的女人被转错去哪了
<4-3,Howard>the only woman who ever loved me?

111
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,360
<4-3,Howard>第一个  我是说第一个爱我
<4-3,Howard>The first... well, first, I meant first.

112
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,430
<4-4,Clerk>我需要一些信息
<4-4,Clerk>I just need some information.

113

115
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,920
<4-6,Howard>我真的是指第一个
<4-6,Howard>I really did mean first.

116
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,690
<4-7,Bernadette>别说了
<4-7,Bernadette>Just drop it.

117
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,300
<4-8,Clerk>你能描述一下那个行李吗
<4-8,Clerk>And can you describe the bag?

<4-9,Bernadette>是黑色的
<4-9,Bernadette>Um, well, it's, uh, black.

119

<4-9,Bernadette>把手上系有红色缎带
<4-9,Bernadette>There's a red ribbon tied to the handle...

122
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,400
<5-2,Penny>好了  马上过来
<5-2,Penny>Yup. Be right there.

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,190
<5-2,Penny>我猜不用给你倒酒了吧
<5-2,Penny>I assume you don't want wine.

124
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,090
<5-3,Sheldon>正确
<5-3,Sheldon>Correct.

125
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,590
<5-3,Sheldon>在操作重型机械时
<5-3,Sheldon>You're not supposed to drink alcohol

126
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,930
<5-3,Sheldon>千万不能喝酒
<5-3,Sheldon>when operating heavy machinery.

127
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,930
<5-4,Penny>什么重型机械
<5-4,Penny>What heavy machinery?

128
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,100
<5-4,Penny>开始吧
<5-4,Penny>Let's just start.

129
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,010
<5-5,Sheldon>作为一名德州的绅士
<5-5,Sheldon>Well, as a Texas gentleman,

130
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,050
<5-5,Sheldon>我会倾向于女士优先
<5-5,Sheldon>I'm inclined to say ladies first.

131
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,530
<5-5,Sheldon>虽然我担心我这么有礼貌这么有魅力
<5-5,Sheldon>Although, I'm concerned that level of politeness and charm

132
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,860
<5-5,Sheldon>可能会导致你在测试没开始之前就爱上我
<5-5,Sheldon>might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins.

133
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,350
<5-5,Sheldon>要不我们扔硬币决定吧
<5-5,Sheldon>Perhaps we should flip a coin.

134
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,340
<5-5,Sheldon>或者如果你会玩
<5-5,Sheldon>Or if you're familiar with the rules

135
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,650
<5-5,Sheldon>-剪刀石头布也行  -问题一
<5-5,Sheldon>- of Rock, Paper, Scissors... - Question one.

136
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,870
<5-6,Penny>"如果可以跟世上任何人共进晚餐
<5-6,Penny>"Given the choice of anyone in the world,

137
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,230
<5-6,Penny>你会选择谁呢
<5-6,Penny>whom would you want as a dinner guest?"

138
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,370
<5-7,Sheldon>活的还是死的
<5-7,Sheldon>Living or dead?

139
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,650
<5-8,Penny>上面只说"世上任何人"
<5-8,Penny>Just says "Anyone in the world."

140
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,800
<5-8,Penny>我猜应该是活的吧
<5-8,Penny>I guess that means living.

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,170
<5-9,Sheldon>那也无妨
<5-9,Sheldon>Ah, that's just as well.

142
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,110
<5-9,Sheldon>尽管我非常想见欧几里得[古希腊数学家]
<5-9,Sheldon>As much as I'd love to meet Euclid--

143
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,630
<5-9,Sheldon>几何证明的发明者
<5-9,Sheldon>inventor of the geometric proof--

144
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,240
<5-9,Sheldon>他很可能穿着拖鞋[当年穿着]
<5-9,Sheldon>he probably wore sandals

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,070
<5-9,Sheldon>我吃饭时可不想看到脚趾
<5-9,Sheldon>and I cannot look at toes during dinner.

146
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,900
<5-9,Sheldon>我想到了
<5-9,Sheldon>Oh, I know!

147
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,080
<5-9,Sheldon>我最想共进晚餐的人就是
<5-9,Sheldon>The person I'd most like to have dinner with

148
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,840
<5-9,Sheldon>我自己
<5-9,Sheldon>is myself.

149
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,640
<5-10,Penny>你确定这个选择吗
<5-10,Penny>You sure that's your choice?

150
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,840
<5-10,Penny>因为我可是跟"他"吃过饭哦
<5-10,Penny>'Cause I've had that dinner.

151
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,390
<5-10,Penny>我还没有
<5-10,Penny>Well, I haven't.

152
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,180
<5-11,Sheldon>人们常说不要跟自己的英雄见面
<5-11,Sheldon>And while they say never meet your heroes,

153
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,670
<5-11,Sheldon>但我不觉得我会让人失望
<5-11,Sheldon>I just don't see how I could disappoint.

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,390
<5-11,Sheldon>你会选择谁
<5-11,Sheldon>Who would you choose?

155
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,580
<5-12,Penny>小罗伯特·唐尼[演员]
<5-12,Penny>Robert Downey, Jr.

156
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,500
<5-12,Penny>你...
<5-12,Penny>You...

157
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,900
<5-13,Sheldon>我没想到钢铁侠
<5-13,Sheldon>I didn't think of Iron Man.

158
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,950
<5-13,Sheldon>或许我和自己共进晚餐后
<5-13,Sheldon>You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner,

159
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,350
<5-13,Sheldon>可以找你们一起吃个甜点
<5-13,Sheldon>we can meet you two for dessert.

160
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,850
<6-1,Raj>你们俩想做点什么
<6-1,Raj>So, what do you guys want to do?

161
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,080
<6-2,Amy>我们俩是跟屁虫  你们定吧
<6-2,Amy>Well, we're the ones tagging along, you pick.

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
<6-3,Emily>你们玩过密室逃脱游戏吗
<6-3,Emily>Have you ever been to an escape room?

163
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,970
<6-4,Leonard>那是什么
<6-4,Leonard>Mm-mm, what's that?

164
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,130
<6-5,Emily>有点像互动式剧场
<6-5,Emily>Um... it's kind of like interactive theater,

165
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,460
<6-5,Emily>不过为了逃出密室
<6-5,Emily>except you have to solve puzzles

166
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,190
<6-5,Emily>你必须在规定时间内解出谜题
<6-5,Emily>in a certain amount of time to get out.

167
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,480
<6-5,Emily>市中心有一间
<6-5,Emily>There's one downtown where

168
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,710
<6-5,Emily>把人和一个僵尸关在一起
<6-5,Emily>they trap you in a room with a zombie.

169
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,500
<6-6,Raj>有点像现在佩妮的处境嘛
<6-6,Raj>So, kind of like what's happening with Penny right now.

170
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,320
<6-6,Raj>"你心中最完美的一天
<6-6,Raj>"What would constitute

171
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,570
<7-1,Sheldon>是做哪些事呢"
<7-1,Sheldon>a perfect day for you?"

172
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,190
<7-2,Penny>这个嘛
<7-2,Penny>Uh, well...

173
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,700
<7-2,Penny>我很可能睡个懒觉  做做瑜伽
<7-2,Penny>I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga,

174
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,050
<7-2,Penny>然后去海滩上躺着
<7-2,Penny>then lie on the beach while

175
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,480
<7-2,Penny>有帅气的小伙子给我端喝的
<7-2,Penny>cute cabana boys brought me drinks and...

176
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,670
<7-2,Penny>可能会去做按摩
<7-2,Penny>probably get a massage

177
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,170
<7-2,Penny>晚上跳跳舞来结束这完美的一天
<7-2,Penny>and then cap off the night with some dancing.

178
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,450
<7-3,Sheldon>就这样吗
<7-3,Sheldon>That's it?

179
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,690
<7-4,Penny>是啊  怎么了
<7-4,Penny>Yeah, why?

180
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,200
<7-5,Sheldon>你完全没提到莱纳德
<7-5,Sheldon>You didn't mention Leonard.

181
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,090
<7-6,Penny>他也在啊
<7-6,Penny>He's there.

182
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,250
<7-7,Sheldon>我可不这么认为
<7-7,Sheldon>I don't think so.

183
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,290
<7-7,Sheldon>莱纳德受不了瑜伽
<7-7,Sheldon>Leonard can't stand yoga,

184
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,900
<7-7,Sheldon>海滩  按摩或跳舞
<7-7,Sheldon>the beach, massages or dancing.

185
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,190
<7-8,Penny>他带了书在一边看  行了吗
<7-8,Penny>Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay?

186
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,470
<7-8,Penny>你的答案是什么
<7-8,Penny>What's yours?

187
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,490
<7-9,Sheldon>我早上醒来
<7-9,Sheldon>Uh, I wake up.

188
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,140
<7-11,Sheldon>享用了浇上黄油和枫糖的法式吐司
<7-11,Sheldon>Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup.

189
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,210
<7-9,Sheldon>然后一个虫洞打开
<7-9,Sheldon>Uh, then a wormhole opens,

190
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,300
<7-9,Sheldon>带我穿越到数百万年后的未来
<7-9,Sheldon>and whisks me millions of years into the future

191
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,030
<7-9,Sheldon>用我超群的智慧去拯救
<7-9,Sheldon>where my towering intellect is used to save

192
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,280
<7-9,Sheldon>掠夺成性的外星种族残害下
<7-9,Sheldon>the last remnants of mankind

193
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,240
<7-9,Sheldon>最后一名人类
<7-9,Sheldon>from a predatory alien race.

194
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,100
<7-10,Penny>奇怪  你也没提艾米啊
<7-10,Penny>Interesting, you didn't mention Amy.

195
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,140
<7-11,Sheldon>你觉得浇上黄油和枫糖的法式吐司是谁做的
<7-11,Sheldon>Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?

196
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,340
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>你们即将进入
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>You're about to enter the lab

197
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,880
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>已故大卫·萨尔兹伯格博士的实验室
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>of the late Dr. David Saltzberg.

199
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,910
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>他在进行延缓衰老过程的研究时
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>While conducting studies on slowing the aging process,

200
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,790
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>出现了灾难性事故  他不幸身亡
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>there was a catastrophic accident and he died.

201
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,000
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>真死了吗
<8-1,Woman in lab coat>Or did he?

202
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,890
<8-2,Leonard>女士优先
<8-2,Leonard>Ladies?

203
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,690
<8-3,Emily>你是出于礼貌还是胆小
<8-3,Emily>Are you being polite or scared?

204
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,910
<8-4,Leonard>是的
<8-4,Leonard>Yup.

205
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,560
<8-5,Emily>这房间厉害啦
<8-5,Emily>Ah, what a room!

206
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,180
<8-7,Leonard>真酷
<8-7,Leonard>This is cool.

207
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,420
<8-8,Amy>我们该怎么开始
<8-8,Amy>So, how do we start?

208
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,020
<8-9,Emily>我们要找出藏在这房间的线索
<8-9,Emily>We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.

209
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,750
<8-10,Raj>这里不是应该有个僵尸吗
<8-10,Raj>Uh, wasn't there supposed to be a zombie?

210
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,030
<8-12,Raj>好吧  希望其中一条线索
<8-12,Raj>Okay, let's hope one of the clues

211
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,600
<8-12,Raj>是写在一条干净的裤衩上
<8-12,Raj>is written on a pair of clean underwear.

212
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,250
<9-1,Clerk>沃罗威茨夫妇
<9-1,Clerk>Mr. And Mrs. Wolowitz?

213
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,610
<9-1,Clerk>据我所知  你们的行李已经到达洛杉矶
<9-1,Clerk>As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.

214
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,790
<9-2,Bernadette>那它在哪里
<9-2,Bernadette>So, where is it?

215
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,500
<9-3,Clerk>我不知道  可能有人
<9-3,Clerk>I don't know, perhaps somebody

216
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,890
<9-3,Clerk>不小心从行李转盘上拿走了
<9-3,Clerk>took it off the carousel by mistake?

217
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,290
<9-4,Howard>所以某个陌生人把我妈带走了
<9-4,Howard>So, some stranger has my mom?

218
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,240
<9-4,Howard>你是这个意思吗
<9-4,Howard>Is that what you're telling me?

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,460
<9-4,Howard>我可怜的母亲现在可能在洛杉矶的任何地方
<9-4,Howard>My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?

220
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,680
<9-5,Clerk>我希望我是这个意思
<9-5,Clerk>I-I wish I was telling you that.

221
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,690
<9-5,Clerk>但那名乘客也可能已经坐上
<9-5,Clerk>Um...but the passenger could've gotten

222
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,090
<9-5,Clerk>国际航班飞走了
<9-5,Clerk>on an international flight.

223
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,800
<9-6,Howard>这下可好
<9-6,Howard>Oh, okay, great!

224
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,280
<9-6,Howard>所以你的工作是寻找丢失的行李
<9-6,Howard>So, your entire job is to find lost luggage,

225
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,770
<9-6,Howard>而你帮我把我母亲的所在范围
<9-6,Howard>and you've narrowed down the location

226
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,740
<9-6,Howard>缩小到整个地球
<9-6,Howard>of my mother to the planet Earth!

227
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,430
<9-6,Howard>非常抱歉
<9-6,Howard>I'm sorry!

228
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,940
<9-7,Clerk>送你们500英里飞行里程好吗
<9-7,Clerk>W-Would 500 frequent-flyer miles help?

229
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,550
<9-7,Clerk>可以让你们飞到萨克拉门托哦
<9-7,Clerk>That could get you to Sacramento.

230
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,330
<10-1,Sheldon>"如果你明早一觉醒来
<10-1,Sheldon>"If you could wake up tomorrow

231
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,770
<10-1,Sheldon>发现自己获得了某种能力
<10-1,Sheldon>having gained any one quality or ability,

232
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,460
<10-1,Sheldon>你希望是什么能力"
<10-1,Sheldon>what would it be?"

233
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,390
<10-2,Penny>我不想山寨圣经故事
<10-2,Penny>Well, not to steal from the Bible,

234
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,570
<10-2,Penny>不过能把水变成酒[耶稣]  还是挺酷的
<10-2,Penny>but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.

235
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,590
<10-3,Sheldon>你完全没有严肃对待这个实验
<10-3,Sheldon>I don't think you're taking this seriously.

236
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,300
<10-4,Penny>我在逗你玩呢
<10-4,Penny>Come on, I'm just having some fun with you.

237
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,180
<10-5,Sheldon>我想你是借插科打诨
<10-5,Sheldon>I believe what you're doing

238
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,050
<10-5,Sheldon>逃避你内心的弱点
<10-5,Sheldon>is using humor to avoid vulnerability.

239
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,920
<10-5,Sheldon>好吧
<10-5,Sheldon>Fine.

240
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,400
<10-6,Penny>老实说
<10-6,Penny>Honestly...

241
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,540
<10-6,Penny>如果我能获得一种能力
<10-6,Penny>if I could have one quality...

242
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,640
<10-6,Penny>我希望我能像你们一样聪明
<10-6,Penny>I wish I could be as smart as you guys.

243
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,950
<10-7,Sheldon>哈  你就做梦吧
<10-7,Sheldon>Ha! Keep dreaming.

244
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,240
<10-8,Penny>谢尔顿
<10-8,Penny>Sheldon!

245
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,010
<10-8,Penny>对不起
<10-8,Penny>I'm sorry.

246
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,210
<10-8,Penny>我这也是在逗你呢
<10-8,Penny>That was me having fun with you.

247
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,330
<10-9,Shedon>我说
<10-9,Shedon>Look.

248
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,450
<10-9,Shedon>你虽然没有
<10-9,Shedon>You may not be as...

249
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,510
<10-9,Shedon>像我们一样有学术天赋
<10-9,Shedon>academically inclined as are we.

250
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,060
<10-9,Shedon>是的  这才是正确的表达方式
<10-9,Shedon>Yes, that's how you say it.

251
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,450
<10-9,Shedon>可是
<10-9,Shedon>But...

252
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,480
<10-9,Shedon>你拥有一种令我羡慕的能力
<10-9,Shedon>You possess an intelligence I envy.

253
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,000
<10-9,Shedon>那也是我对这个问题的答案
<10-9,Shedon>Which leads me to my answer.

254
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,980
<10-9,Shedon>我希望能获得
<10-9,Shedon>I would choose the ability

255
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,400
<10-10,Penny>读别人心思的能力
<10-10,Penny>to read people's minds.

256
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,680
<10-10,Penny>其实我也没法读别人的心思
<10-10,Penny>Well, I can't read people's minds.

257
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,860
<10-10,Penny>其实  这话我说错了
<10-10,Penny>Actually, that's not true.

258
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,050
<10-10,Penny>我可以读到男人的心思
<10-10,Penny>I can read men's minds.

259
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,760
<10-10,Penny>但那是因为他们想的都是一件事
<10-10,Penny>But only 'cause it's usually the one thing.

260
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,900
<10-11,Sheldon>我们什么时候才能拥有机械人眼睛吗
<10-11,Sheldon>When are we going to get robot eyes?

261
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,780
<10-12,Penny>你们男人想得都一样
<10-12,Penny>You're all alike.

262
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,280
<10-13,Sheldon>我的意思是
<10-13,Sheldon>Well, what I meant was...

263
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,670
<10-13,Sheldon>我经常误解
<10-13,Sheldon>I often misinterpret

264
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,300
<10-13,Sheldon>别人的想法
<10-13,Sheldon>how others are feeling.

265
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,630
<10-13,Sheldon>比如  我有时会分不清别人是在开玩笑
<10-13,Sheldon>Like, I can't always tell if someone is only joking

266
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,110
<10-13,Sheldon>还是在嘲笑我
<10-13,Sheldon>or laughing at me.

267
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,800
<10-13,Sheldon>比如他们是在生我的气
<10-13,Sheldon>You know, like, uh, if they're mad at something I've done

268
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,420
<10-13,Sheldon>还是单纯情绪不佳而已
<10-13,Sheldon>or just in a bad mood.

269
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,880
<10-13,Sheldon>真是让我压力山大
<10-13,Sheldon>It-it's incredibly stressful.

270
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,200
<10-14,Penny>真的吗  你看起来一直很有自信啊
<10-14,Penny>Really? You always seem so confident.

271
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,380
<10-14,Penny>其实我没有
<10-14,Penny>Well, I'm not.

272
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,320
<10-15,Sheldon>如果我能读懂别人的心思
<10-15,Sheldon>And if I could read people's minds,

273
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
<10-15,Sheldon>生活应该多么轻松愉快啊
<10-15,Sheldon>life would be so much simpler.

274
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,540
<10-16,Penny>我现在希望我拥有能让你
<10-16,Penny>Well, now I wish I had the ability

275
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,030
<10-16,Penny>轻松读懂别人心思的能力了
<10-16,Penny>to make that stuff easier for you.

276
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,650
<10-17,Sheldon>谢谢你
<10-17,Sheldon>Thank you.

277
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,930
<10-18,Penny>我刚刚心头
<10-18,Penny>Wow, I just felt

278
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,910
<10-18,Penny>涌上一股对你浓烈的感情
<10-18,Penny>this wave of affection for you.

279
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,660
<10-19,Sheldon>你确定不是喝多"圣经琼浆"迷糊了吗
<10-19,Sheldon>You sure it's not too much Bible juice?

280
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,890
<10-20,Penny>那股感情迅速退去
<10-20,Penny>And the wave is gone.

281
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,840
<11-1,Zombie>我要吃大脑
<11-1,Zombie>Brains!

282
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,550
<11-2,Amy>小声点  我们这儿在工作呢
<11-2,Amy>Keep it down! We're working here.

283
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,370
<11-3,Raj>我们破解了这个密码
<11-3,Raj>Okay, we've got the cipher decoded!

284
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,610
<11-4,Emily>地球仪搞定了吗
<11-4,Emily>How's it going with the globe?

285
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,610
<11-5,Amy>我们用坐标确定了城市
<11-5,Amy>We used the coordinates to locate the cities.

286
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,130
<11-6,Leonard>我正在把城市名填入表格
<11-6,Leonard>I'm putting the city names in the grid now.

287
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,920
<11-6,Leonard>马上就能得出安全屋的口令了
<11-6,Leonard>I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.

288
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,760
<11-7,Zombie>谜题解答太迅猛
<11-7,Zombie>Solve puzzle too fast!

289
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,450
<11-7,Zombie>慢一点
<11-7,Zombie>Slow down!

290
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,360
<11-8,Leonard>好了  拿到口令了
<11-8,Leonard>Yup! Got the code.

291
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
<11-9,Zombie>我就说一声...
<11-9,Zombie>Just saying...

292
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,130
<11-9,Zombie>你们玩得快也不退门票哦
<11-9,Zombie>no refund for finish early!

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,870
<12-1,Bernadette>你真的不想回家吗
<12-1,Bernadette>Sure you don't want to go home?

294
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,160
<12-1,Bernadette>等包裹找到了  他们会送到我们家的
<12-1,Bernadette>When the bag's returned, they'll deliver it to us.

295
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,300
<12-2,Howard>不  找不到她我就不走
<12-2,Howard>No, I'm not leaving without her.

296
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,990
<12-3,Bernadette>好吧  我们慢慢等
<12-3,Bernadette>All right, we'll wait.

297
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,130
<12-4,Howard>我本应该开车载她的
<12-4,Howard>I could've driven her.

298
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,660
<12-5,Bernadette>什么
<12-5,Bernadette>What?

299
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,600
<12-6,Howard>她去佛罗里达的那天
<12-6,Howard>The day she left for Florida.

300
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,130
<12-6,Howard>她让我载她去机场
<12-6,Howard>She asked me to drive her to the airport.

301
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,730
<12-6,Howard>我太忙了
<12-6,Howard>I-I was too busy.

302
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,300
<12-6,Howard>于是我让她
<12-6,Howard>And...I made her

303
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,710
<12-6,Howard>坐出租车去
<12-6,Howard>take a cab.

304
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,800
<12-6,Howard>我说自己太忙了
<12-6,Howard>I was too busy.

305
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,030
<12-7,Bernadette>你也意想不到嘛
<12-7,Bernadette>There's no way you could've known.

306
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,050
<12-7,Bernadette>我过去一下
<12-7,Bernadette>Be right back.

307
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,860
<12-7,Bernadette>打扰一下

<12-9,Bernadette>你最好找到我老公的妈妈
<12-9,Bernadette>You better find my husband's mother

310
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,180
<12-9,Bernadette>因为我们离开机场时  无论如何
<12-9,Bernadette>'cause one way or another, we're walking out of this airport

311
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,350
<12-9,Bernadette>都要带走一个死女人
<12-9,Bernadette>with a dead woman!

312
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,290
<13-1,Leonard>我们要找哪本书

318
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,170
<13-5,Raj>"我没有兄弟姐妹
<13-5,Raj>Uh, "Brothers and sisters I have none,

319
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,970
<13-5,Raj>但这个人的父亲是我父亲的儿子
<13-5,Raj>but this man's father is my father's son.

320
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,930
<13-5,Raj>请问这个人是谁"
<13-5,Raj>Who am I looking at?"

321
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,040
<13-5,Raj>好了  我们知道你想吃大脑
<13-5,Raj>Yeah, yeah, we get it-- you want brains.

322
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,660
<13-5,Raj>别闹
<13-5,Raj>Calm down.

323
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,320
<13-6,Amy>如果我没有兄弟
<13-6,Amy>Well, if I don't have a brother,

324
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,980
<13-6,Amy>那我父亲的儿子就是我自己了
<13-6,Amy>my father's son is me.

325
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,350
<13-6,Amy>如果我是这个人的父亲  那他就是我儿子
<13-6,Amy>And if I'm this man's father, then he's my son.

326
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,420
<13-6,Amy>答案是儿子
<13-6,Amy>The answer's "son."

327
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,850
<13-7,Emily>那里有一张太阳的照片[同音]
<13-7,Emily>Ooh! There's a picture of the sun over there.

328
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,110
<13-8,Leonard>钥匙一定在后面
<13-8,Leonard>I bet the key's behind it.

329
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,550
<13-9,Zombie>也可能不在后面哦
<13-9,Zombie>Could be somewhere else!

330
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,240
<13-10,Emily>找到钥匙了
<13-10,Emily>Oh, got the key!

331
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,200
<13-11,Amy>所以这就是开门的钥匙了吗
<13-11,Amy>So, that's the key to the door?

332
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,480
<13-11,Amy>就这样完了吗
<13-11,Amy>That's it?

333
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,510
<13-12,Leonard>我们花了200大洋  就玩了6分钟而已
<13-12,Leonard>We spent $200 on six minutes of fun?

334
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,880
<13-13,Raj>感觉就像是你买的那台遥控直升机
<13-13,Raj>It's like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter,

335
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,940
<13-13,Raj>结果就...飞走了
<13-13,Raj>and it just... flew away.

336
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,220
<13-14,Emily>对不起了各位
<13-14,Emily>Sorry, guys.

337
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,390
<13-14,Emily>我本以为谜题会更难一点呢
<13-14,Emily>Really thought the puzzles would be better.

338
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,070
<13-15,Amy>说句公道话  我们都是有高等学历的人
<13-15,Amy>Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.

339
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,630
<13-16,Zombie>网上点评的时候别忘了说这句哦
<13-16,Zombie>Remember that before you post on Yelp!

340
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,580
<14-1,Penny>"如果你将在今晚死去  没有任何
<14-1,Penny>"If you were to die this evening with no opportunity

341
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,960
<14-1,Penny>再与他人交流的机会
<14-1,Penny>to communicate with anyone,

342
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,500
<14-1,Penny>你最后悔没有把什么事情跟别人说"
<14-1,Penny>what would you most regret not having told someone?"

343
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,040
<14-2,Sheldon>那就是今天
<14-2,Sheldon>So, it would be today?

344
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,470
<14-2,Sheldon>在生日这天死亡
<14-2,Sheldon>Well, I suppose there's something satisfying

345
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,020
<14-2,Sheldon>也还算是某种满足吧
<14-2,Sheldon>about dying on my birthday.

346
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,940
<14-3,Penny>今天是你生日吗
<14-3,Penny>Today's your birthday?

347
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,900
<14-4,Sheldon>是的
<14-4,Sheldon>Yes.

348
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,180
<14-5,Penny>你一直都当秘密没说
<14-5,Penny>Well, that's always been a secret!

349
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,020
<14-5,Penny>连艾米都不知道
<14-5,Penny>Not even Amy knows!

350
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,700
<14-6,Sheldon>因为我不喜欢收礼物
<14-6,Sheldon>Well, I don't enjoy presents.

351
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,150
<14-6,Sheldon>以及想到一大堆人
<14-6,Sheldon>And the thought of people

352
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,600
<14-6,Sheldon>蹦出来大喊"惊喜"
<14-6,Sheldon>jumping out and yelling "Surprise!"

353
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,680
<14-6,Sheldon>比"乔治·卢卡斯导演剪辑版"
<14-6,Sheldon>fills me with more dread than the words

354
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,980
<14-6,Sheldon>更让我身怀恐惧
<14-6,Sheldon>"George Lucas Director's Cut."

355
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,940
<14-7,Penny>那你为什么又对我说了
<14-7,Penny>So, why did you finally tell me?

356
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,960
<14-8,Sheldon>这个实验的重点就是
<14-8,Sheldon>The point of the experiment is

357
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,380
<14-8,Sheldon>对彼此绝对坦诚
<14-8,Sheldon>to be completely honest with each other.

358
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,780
<14-9,Penny>谢谢你愿意告诉我
<14-9,Penny>Well, thank you for sharing it with me.

359
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,500
<14-9,Penny>我不会说出去的
<14-9,Penny>I won't tell anyone.

360
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,030
<14-10,Sheldon>谢谢
<14-10,Sheldon>Thank you.

361
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,500
<14-11,Penny>太好玩了
<14-11,Penny>That is so funny.

362
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,350
<14-11,Penny>我从来没想过你居然是双鱼座
<14-11,Penny>I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.

363
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,000
<14-12,Sheldon>你在增加我爱上你的难度
<14-12,Sheldon>You're making it difficult to love you right now.

364
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,970
<15-1,Clerk>好消息  你们的行李还回来了

<15-4,Howard>that I'll never forgive myself for being so selfish.

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,150

376
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,580
<15-5,Bernadette>亲娘的  这玩意要被摆到卧室了
<15-5,Bernadette>Oh, no. That thing's gonna end up in my bedroom.

377
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,290
<16-1,Sheldon>没有了  问题都答完了
<16-1,Sheldon>That's it! We're done with the questions.

378
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,560
<16-2,Penny>只剩下彼此凝视四分钟
<16-2,Penny>All that's left to do is stare into each other's eyes

379
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,090
<16-2,Penny>不许说话
<16-2,Penny>for four minutes without talking.

380
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,870
<16-2,Penny>好
<16-2,Penny>Okay.

381
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,040
<16-3,Sheldon>等一下
<16-3,Sheldon>Wait, hang on!

382
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,680
<16-3,Sheldon>膀胱检查
<16-3,Sheldon>Bladder check.

383
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,460
<16-3,Sheldon>可以开始了
<16-3,Sheldon>We're good to go.

384
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,030
<16-4,Penny>准备
<16-4,Penny>You ready?

385
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,710
<16-5,Sheldon>好
<16-5,Sheldon>Yes.

386
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,240
<16-6,Penny>现在开始
<16-6,Penny>And begin.

387
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,520
<16-9,Sheldon>这样有点怪啊
<16-9,Sheldon>This is kind of creepy.

388
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,490
<16-7,Sheldon>这段期间我们不应该说话
<16-7,Sheldon>We're not supposed to talk during this part.

389
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,730
<16-8,Penny>对不起
<16-8,Penny>Sorry.

390
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,990
<16-9,Sheldon>这样有点怪啊
<16-9,Sheldon>This is kind of creepy.

391
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,360
<16-10,Penny>想停吗
<16-10,Penny>Do you want to stop?

392
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,380
<16-10,Penny>我知道你不喜欢目光交流
<16-10,Penny>I know you have trouble with eye contact.

393
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,470
<16-11,Sheldon>你右眼虹膜上有个棕色小斑点
<16-11,Sheldon>Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris

394
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,150
<16-11,Sheldon>像一辆一级方程式赛车
<16-11,Sheldon>that looks like a Formula One race car.

395
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,320
<16-11,Sheldon>所以  我就盯着它看好了
<16-11,Sheldon>So... I'm just concentrating on that.

396
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,440
<16-11,Sheldon>而且和处着舒服的人在一起
<16-11,Sheldon>Plus, it's easier around people

397
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,280
<16-11,Sheldon>已经简单很多了
<16-11,Sheldon>that I'm comfortable with.

398
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,680
<16-12,Penny>亲爱的  和你相处也很舒服
<16-12,Penny>Aw, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.

399
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,970
<16-13,Sheldon>当然  我是如此温暖的可人儿
<16-13,Sheldon>Of course you are, I'm warm and soothing.

400
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,470
<16-13,Sheldon>简直是一碗人形番茄汤
<16-13,Sheldon>I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.

401
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,050
<16-14,Penny>我是说把你当弟弟一样看
<16-14,Penny>I meant more like a little brother.

402
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,940
<16-15,Sheldon>其实我真会把你当姐姐
<16-15,Sheldon>Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister.

403
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,350
<16-15,Sheldon>有时候当妈妈
<16-15,Sheldon>And sometimes, a mother.

404
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,900
<16-16,Penny>感觉又变怪了
<16-16,Penny>It's getting creepy again.

405
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,200
<16-17,Sheldon>怎么了
<16-17,Sheldon>What?

406
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,400
<16-18,Penny>想到了第一天见到你和莱纳德
<16-18,Penny>Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.

407
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,530
<16-19,Sheldon>那是周一下午
<16-19,Sheldon>It was a Monday afternoon.

408
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,010
<16-19,Sheldon>你来和我们一起吃印度餐
<16-19,Sheldon>You joined us for Indian food.

409
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,490
<16-20,Penny>真不敢相信已经八年了
<16-20,Penny>Can you believe it's been eight years?

410
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,580
<16-21,Sheldon>你还在蹭我们的饭
<16-21,Sheldon>Yeah, and you're still eating our food.

411
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,180
<16-22,Penny>我...都记不起
<16-22,Penny>I... can't remember a time

412
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,980
<16-22,Penny>没有你们的生活是怎样的了
<16-22,Penny>you guys weren't in my life.

413
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,630
<16-23,Sheldon>我记得一清二楚
<16-23,Sheldon>I remember it perfectly.

414
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,060
<16-23,Sheldon>因为我过目不忘
<16-23,Sheldon>But I have an eidetic memory.

415
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,370
<16-23,Sheldon>如果你感兴趣
<16-23,Sheldon>If you're interested, I also remember

416
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,730
<16-23,Sheldon>我还记得你总共欠我们多少饭钱
<16-23,Sheldon>how much you owe us for the food.

417
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,910
<16-23,Sheldon>时间到了
<16-23,Sheldon>That's it.

418
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,380
<16-24,Penny>还不算太糟
<16-24,Penny>That wasn't so bad.

419
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,930
<16-24,Penny>真不算
<16-24,Penny>No, it wasn't.

420
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,640
<16-25,Sheldon>现在我们来整理一下试验结果
<16-25,Sheldon>Uh, now let's tabulate the results of the experiment.

421
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,150
<16-25,Sheldon>可以放心地说出  你没有爱上我
<16-25,Sheldon>I think it's safe to say that you're not in love with me

422
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,290
<16-25,Sheldon>我也没有爱上你
<16-25,Sheldon>and I'm not in love with you.

423
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,700
<16-25,Sheldon>而心理学再次自证了
<16-25,Sheldon>And psychology has once again

424
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,670
<16-25,Sheldon>自己是科学中的蠢货
<16-25,Sheldon>proved itself the doofus of the sciences.

425
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,090
<16-26,Penny>也许吧
<16-26,Penny>Well, maybe.

426
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,420
<16-26,Penny>但我还是很开心我们做了这个
<16-26,Penny>But I'm still glad we did it.

427
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,190
<16-26,Penny>感觉和你更亲近了
<16-26,Penny>I do feel closer to you.

428
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,530
<16-27,Sheldon>彼此彼此
<16-27,Sheldon>And I, you.

429
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,720
<16-27,Sheldon>是的  这才是正确的表达方式
<16-27,Sheldon>And yes, that's how you say that.

430
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,180
<16-27,Sheldon>考虑到我们新建立的亲密度
<16-27,Sheldon>Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy,

431
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,740
<16-27,Sheldon>有很多难以抉择的问题得做决定
<16-27,Sheldon>I'd say we have some hard choices to make.

432
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,880
<16-28,Penny>比如什么
<16-28,Penny>Like what?

433
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,100
<16-29,Sheldon>加里大会  我们开车去还是搭飞机
<16-29,Sheldon>Gary Con-- do we fly or drive?

434
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,380
<16-29,Sheldon>扮还是不扮人物
<16-29,Sheldon>Do we wear costumes?

435
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,170
<16-29,Sheldon>如果扮
<16-29,Sheldon>And if so...

436
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,860
<16-29,Sheldon>谁来扮加里
<16-29,Sheldon>who gets to be Gary?

437
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,960
<17-1,Sheldon>谢谢你送我回家
<17-1,Sheldon>Thank you for walking me home.

438
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
<17-2,Penny>只是想看你安全到家
<17-2,Penny>I just want to make sure you get there safe.

439
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,380
<17-3,Sheldon>好了  我到家了
<17-3,Sheldon>Well, this is me.

440
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,570
<17-3,Sheldon>今晚过得真有趣
<17-3,Sheldon>It's been a very interesting evening.

441
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,520
<17-4,Penny>确实如此
<17-4,Penny>It really has.

442
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,350
<17-5,All>惊喜
<17-5,All>Surprise!
