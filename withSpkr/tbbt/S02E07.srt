<2-49,Sheldon>你为什么要这么对我
<2-49,Sheldon>Why would you do that?

122
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,530
<2-50,Penny>不知道  我饿了
<2-50,Penny>I don't know. I was hungry?

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,460
<2-51,Sheldon>没有人可以动我盘子里的食物
<2-51,Sheldon>The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.

<2-52,Penny>好吧  我不知道  对不起了
<2-52,Penny>All right. Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry.

<2-56,Penny>这是个体育方面的暗喻
<2-56,Penny>It's a sports metaphor.

131

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,530
<2-63,Sheldon>我信任你才给你我的邮箱
<2-63,Sheldon>I trusted you with my email address,

142

<2-63,Sheldon>你发网络老古董给我  这就背叛了我对你的信任
<2-63,Sheldon>and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality:

143
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,600
<2-63,Sheldon>一振
<2-63,Sheldon>strike one.

<2-64,Leonard>别担心  只在你的档案里保存一年
<2-64,Leonard>Don't worry. They only stay on your record for a year.

146
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,200
<2-65,Howard>你也能早点把它们从你的档案里去掉  可就得去上他的课
<2-65,Howard>You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,530
<2-67,Sheldon>从而污染了其它洋葱圈

<2-77,Penny>I don't care. I'm taking a stand.

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,730
<2-77,Penny>这是个暗喻[taking a stand  明确立场]
<2-77,Penny>Metaphorically.

<2-78,Sheldon>那好吧  三振出局

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,460
<3-4,Leonard>弱弱地问一句  你愿意来听他的课么
<3-4,Leonard>Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class?

171
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,060
<3-4,Leonard>你可以在网上听
<3-4,Leonard>You can do it online!

172
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,960

<4-1,Howard>我们锁定了超模的所在地
<4-1,Howard>we've narrowed down the location of the Top Model house

<4-3,Howard>我们找到的时候你想和我们一起去么
<4-3,Howard>When we find it, you want to go with us?

177

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,760
<4-6,Leonard>你可去不成
<4-6,Leonard>You're not going to party with them.

181
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,560
<4-6,Leonard>你连接近那个地方都做不到
<4-6,Leonard>You're not even going to get anywhere near that place.

182
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,760
<4-7,Howard>关于月球  当年他们也是对阿姆斯特朗[登月第一人]也是这么说的

<4-8,Sheldon>没人对阿姆斯特朗说过这样的话
<4-8,Sheldon>No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong.

<4-8,Sheldon>为了送一个人上月球

<4-10,Raj>之后会有很多人认为这事从来没发生过
<4-10,Raj>And a large number of people will believe it never happened.

189
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,100
<4-11,Penny (arriving)>让我想想
<4-11,Penny (arriving)>Okay, let me guess.

<4-15,Penny>我没告诉你么
<4-15,Penny>Oh, I didn't tell you?

<4-16,Sheldon>为什么
<4-16,Sheldon>Why?

203
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,060

205
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,500
<4-17,Penny>三振是因为我不喜欢你的态度
<4-17,Penny>And three: I don't like your attitude.

206
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,060
<4-17,Penny>你不能这么做
<4-17,Penny>You can't do that.

207
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,360
<4-18,Sheldon>这不仅违反了加州法律
<4-18,Sheldon>Not only is it a violation of California state law,

208
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,400
<4-18,Sheldon>而且明目张胆地违背了芝士蛋糕工厂的规定
<4-18,Sheldon>it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.

209
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,030
<4-19,Penny>不会  现在有新的规定了
<4-19,Penny>Yeah, no, there's a new policy:

<4-19,Penny>日本人与谢尔顿不准进入
<4-19,Penny>No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

<4-20,Howard>我打赌这种牌子一定能在帕萨迪纳大卖
<4-20,Howard>I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.

00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,830
<4-21,Leonard>佩妮  我能和你说句话么
<4-21,Leonard>Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?

213
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,400
<4-22,Penny>事情是这样的
<4-22,Penny>Well, here's the thing.

214
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,260
<4-23,Leonard>我和谢尔顿谈过了 他也觉得自己过分
<4-23,Leonard>Um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible

215
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,100
<4-23,Leonard>他也认为他有点不可理喻  有点过火了
<4-23,Leonard>and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.

216
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,700
<4-24,Penny>真的吗  那太好了
<4-24,Penny>Really? Well, that's great.

217
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,760
<4-25,Leonard>是的  跟他道个歉  好吗
<4-25,Leonard>Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?

218
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,600
<4-26,Penny>什么  我干嘛要向那个疯子道歉
<4-26,Penny>What? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase.

219
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,900
<4-27,Leonard>别这样  其实很简单
<4-27,Leonard>Oh, come on. It's easy.

220
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,130
<4-27,Leonard>他还会亲自指导你怎么道歉
<4-27,Leonard>He'll even tell you what to say.

221
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,300
<4-28,Penny>莱纳德  你还没开窍吗
<4-28,Penny>Leard, don't you get it?

222
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,200
<4-28,Penny>如果你们一味让他这样神经兮兮
<4-28,Penny>If you guys keep going along with his insanity,

223
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,510
<4-28,Penny>会助长他的气焰
<4-28,Penny>you're just encouraging him.

224
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,770
<4-29,Leonard>才没有 我们是  卑躬屈膝
<4-29,Leonard>We're not encouraging. It's more like... knuckling under.

225
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,940
<4-30,Penny>我喜欢和你们一起
<4-30,Penny>Look, I like hanging out with you guys,

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,300
<4-30,Penny>但我绝不会为莫须有的罪名道歉
<4-30,Penny>but I'm not going to apologize for something I didn't do.

227
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,670
<4-31,Leonard>事实上  严格来说  你真的有做
<4-31,Leonard>Well, actually, technically, you did do it.

228
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
<4-32,Penny>那是一振  莱纳德
<4-32,Penny>That's strike one, Leonard.

229
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,770
<5-1,Penny>这是你的油炸玉米粉饼

<9-14,Sheldon>Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick

329
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,970
<9-14,Sheldon>然后开始玩"挑裤衩"吧
<9-14,Sheldon>and play panty pinata.

330
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,640
<9-15,Penny>等等  谢尔顿  我们做得过头了
<9-15,Penny>Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay?

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
<9-16,Sheldon>我才没做蠢事
<9-16,Sheldon>I've done no stupid things.

335
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,370
<9-17,Penny>我已经作出让步了  你也应该有所表示
<9-17,Penny>Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.

336
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,940
<9-18,Sheldon>我有表示的
<9-18,Sheldon>I am meeting you halfway.

343
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,570
<9-21,Leonard>你干啥了
