7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,080
<1-1,Sheldon>"不是你们看上去的那样"
<1-1,Sheldon>It's not what it looks like.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,840
<1-1,Sheldon>"不是你们看上去的那样"
<1-1,Sheldon>It's not what it looks like.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,530
<1-2,Leonard>你在碎碎念什么啊
<1-2,Leonard>What are you grinding about?

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,700
<1-3,Sheldon>佩妮今早留下的头脑风暴悬念
<1-3,Sheldon>Penny's brain teaser this morning.

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,380
<1-3,Sheldon>她跟库萨帕里
<1-3,Sheldon>She and Koothrappali

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,240
<1-3,Sheldon>从你的卧室走出
<1-3,Sheldon>emerge from your bedroom.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,980
<1-3,Sheldon>她衣衫不整  拉杰只裹了个床单
<1-3,Sheldon>She is disheveled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,560
<1-3,Sheldon>唯一的线索只有"不是你们看上去的那样"
<1-3,Sheldon>The sole clue: "It's not what it looks like."

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,100
<1-4,Leonard>别纠结了  谢尔顿
<1-4,Leonard>Just let it go, Sheldon.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,420
<1-5,Sheldon>纠结不是我想停  想停就能停的
<1-5,Sheldon>If I could, I would, but I can't, so I shan't.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,710
<1-5,Sheldon>目前的信息表明佩妮
<1-5,Sheldon>Now, knowing Penny,

18
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,030
<1-5,Sheldon>最明显的答案当然是两人交媾了
<1-5,Sheldon>the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus.

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,320
<1-5,Sheldon>但是...
<1-5,Sheldon>But...

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,450
<1-5,Sheldon>鉴于那是"看上去的那样"
<1-5,Sheldon>Since that's what it looked like,

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,160
<1-5,Sheldon>我们可以排除这个可能性
<1-5,Sheldon>we can rule that out.

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,960
<1-5,Sheldon>让我们戴上智能帽子考虑一下吧  如何
<1-5,Sheldon>Let's put on our thinking cap, shall we?

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,740
<1-5,Sheldon>拉杰来自印度  一个热带国家
<1-5,Sheldon>Raj is from India, a tropical country.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,210
<1-5,Sheldon>第三世界的卫生条件
<1-5,Sheldon>Third World hygiene.

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,780
<1-5,Sheldon>寄生病感染司空见惯  例如蛲虫病
<1-5,Sheldon>Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms.

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,180
<1-5,Sheldon>诊断蛲虫病的步骤  就是等待
<1-5,Sheldon>The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait

28
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,820
<1-5,Sheldon>直到宿主陷入沉睡状态
<1-5,Sheldon>until the subject is asleep,

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,110
<1-5,Sheldon>然后蛲虫从宿主的直肠爬出来透气
<1-5,Sheldon>and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.

30
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,140
<1-5,Sheldon>没错  正像你刚才那样
<1-5,Sheldon>Yes, just like that.

31
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,970
<1-5,Sheldon>佩妮可能在观测寄生虫从拉杰的菊花爬出来呢
<1-5,Sheldon>Penny could have been inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites.

32
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,320
<1-5,Sheldon>天呐
<1-5,Sheldon>Oh, boy.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,210
<1-5,Sheldon>真是位称职的蓝颜知己啊
<1-5,Sheldon>That's a true blue friend.

34
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,340
<1-6,Leonard>他们上床了  大神探
<1-6,Leonard>They slept together, Sherlock.

35
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,990
<1-7,Sheldon>不  你没认真听
<1-7,Sheldon>No, you weren't listening.

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,750
<1-7,Sheldon>她说了  "不是你们看上去的那样"
<1-7,Sheldon>She said it's not what it looks like.

37
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,340
<1-8,Leonard>她说谎了
<1-8,Leonard>She lied.

38
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,330
<1-8,Leonard>呃
<1-8,Leonard>Oh.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,260
<1-9,Sheldon>那我坐在这还戴着这东西岂不是弱爆了
<1-9,Sheldon>Don't I look silly sitting here wearing this?

49
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,060
<2-3,Leonard>莱纳德  现在对你而言
<2-3,Leonard>Leonard, is it awkward for you

50
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,100
<2-4,Sheldon>看到你的挚友跟你曾经爱过的女人
<2-4,Sheldon>knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse

51
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,740
<2-4,Sheldon>就在你每天睡觉的地方交媾
<2-4,Sheldon>with a woman you used to love

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,120
<2-4,Sheldon>是否觉得很尴尬
<2-4,Sheldon>in the very place you lay your head?

53
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,560
<2-5,Leonard>不  我能接受
<2-5,Leonard>No, I'm fine with it.

54
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,710
<2-6,Sheldon>那听起来像讽刺啊
<2-6,Sheldon>That sounds like sarcasm,

55
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,820
<2-6,Sheldon>但是我决定无视它
<2-6,Sheldon>but I'm going to disregard it,

56
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,830
<2-6,Sheldon>因为我还有其他安排: 玩彩弹枪
<2-6,Sheldon>because I have an agenda-- paintball.

57
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,330
<2-6,Sheldon>本周来点特别的  搞个不同部门间的比赛
<2-6,Sheldon>Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend.

58
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,520
<2-6,Sheldon>为了变为更有效率的作战小队
<2-6,Sheldon>In order to function better as a fighting unit,

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,140
<2-6,Sheldon>我认为我们有必要建立一个领导机制
<2-6,Sheldon>I thought we should establish a chain of command.

60
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,500
<2-6,Sheldon>当然自不待言
<2-6,Sheldon>Now, it goes without saying

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,380
<2-6,Sheldon>我的地位理应高于你们三位
<2-6,Sheldon>that I would outrank the three of you,

62
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,730
<2-6,Sheldon>但问题在于  高多少呢
<2-6,Sheldon>but the question remains, by how much?

63
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,650
<2-6,Sheldon>我认为我不该充当那种在指挥部桌前发号施令
<2-6,Sheldon>Now, I don't see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk

64
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,420
<2-6,Sheldon>只会跟国防部打高尔夫的四星上将的角色
<2-6,Sheldon>and playing golf with the Secretary of Defense.

65
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,480
<2-6,Sheldon>但我也不能当库珀中士
<2-6,Sheldon>But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper,

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,390
<2-6,Sheldon>这可能会误导你们
<2-6,Sheldon>because that might lead you

67
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,120
<2-6,Sheldon>把我仅仅看成个小人物
<2-6,Sheldon>to think of me as just a regular Joe.

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,620
<2-6,Sheldon>这事儿可能需要动点脑筋  交给你们了
<2-6,Sheldon>This might take some thought. As you were.

69
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,030
<2-7,Leonard>你到底有什么毛病啊
<2-7,Leonard>What the hell is wrong with you?

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,330
<2-8,Howard>是啊  你怎么能这么做呢
<2-8,Howard>Yeah, how could you do that?

71
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,240
<2-10,Howard>-跟你有何关联  -我挺他啊
<2-10,Howard>- What is it to you? - I got his back.

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,200
<2-11,Raj>是啊  你嫉妒我因为事实证明
<2-11,Raj>Yeah, right. You're just jealous because it turns out

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,900
<2-11,Raj>我才是佩妮仅次于莱纳德的第二选择
<2-11,Raj>I'm Penny's number two choice after Leonard.

74
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,010
<2-12,Howard>拜托  如果我没跟伯纳黛特订婚
<2-12,Howard>Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette,

75
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,990
<2-12,Howard>二号选择完全可能是我
<2-12,Howard>that totally could have been me.

76
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,570
<2-13,Leonard>拜托  谢尔顿都有可能在你之前
<2-13,Leonard>Please. Sheldon would have been before you,

77
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,060
<2-13,Leonard>他说不定连生殖器都没有呢
<2-13,Leonard>and he might not even have genitals!

78
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,030
<2-14,Raj>你为何这么在意啊
<2-14,Raj>Why do you care so much?

79
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,250
<2-14,Raj>你还跟我妹妹约会呢
<2-14,Raj>You're dating my sister,

80
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,290
<2-14,Raj>况且佩妮和我还相恋了
<2-14,Raj>and Penny and I are in love.

81
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,510
<2-15,Leonard and Howard together>什么
<2-15,Leonard and Howard together>What?!

82
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,880
<2-16,Sheldon>先生们  容我插一句
<2-16,Sheldon>Gentlemen, if I may interject,

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,480
<2-16,Sheldon>我决定我的军阶为上尉了
<2-16,Sheldon>I've decided my rank will be captain.

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,760
<2-16,Sheldon>如果科克船长  嘎嘣脆船长和袋鼠船长都能胜任此职
<2-16,Sheldon>If it's good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo,

86
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,150
<2-16,Sheldon>那对我而言也不错
<2-16,Sheldon>it's good enough for me.

87
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,120
<2-17,Howard>你没有跟佩妮相恋
<2-17,Howard>You're not in love with Penny.

88
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,270
<2-18,Raj>有  我有
<2-18,Raj>Yes, I am.

89
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,800
<2-18,Raj>伟大的天神迦摩天用他的爱之花箭射中了我们
<2-18,Raj>The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.

90
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,610
<2-19,Howard>谁
<2-19,Howard>Who?

91
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,180
<2-20,Raj>他是印度的丘比特
<2-20,Raj>He's the Hindu version of Cupid,

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,020
<2-20,Raj>但他帅多了  因为他骑着一只硕大的鹦鹉
<2-20,Raj>but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.

93
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,410
<2-21,Leonard>拜托拉杰  哪个女孩子对你笑  你就会爱上谁
<2-21,Leonard>Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you.

94
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,800
<2-21,Leonard>一个月前  你还给他未婚妻写情诗呢
<2-21,Leonard>A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiance.

95
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,920
<2-22,Howard>什么  他啥意思
<2-22,Howard>I'm sorry. What?!

96
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,730
<2-23,Raj>胡说  他胡说八道
<2-23,Raj>Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.

97
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,020
<2-24,Leonard>哦  伯纳黛特  请给我吹箫吧
<2-24,Leonard>"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."

98
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,000
<2-25,Raj>那也可以是别人嘛
<2-25,Raj>That could have been about anyone.

99
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,220
<2-25,Raj>况且  你没必要担心
<2-25,Raj>Besides, you have nothing to worry about,

100
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,010
<2-25,Raj>我现在是库佩恋的主角之一
<2-25,Raj>because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.

101
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,480
<2-26,Sheldon>说明一下  我有生殖器
<2-26,Sheldon>For the record, I do have genitals.

102
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,950
<2-26,Sheldon>不但功能强劲  而且外形健美
<2-26,Sheldon>They're functional and aesthetically pleasing.

103
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,630
<3-1,Penny>来了
<3-1,Penny>Oh. Coming.

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,730
<3-1,Penny>说到底
<3-1,Penny>Yup, that's good.

105
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,030
<3-1,Penny>还是一醉解千愁
<3-1,Penny>Wine glasses should have handles.

106
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,930
<3-2,Amy>准确记录你的酒精摄入量
<3-2,Amy>Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake.

107
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,940
<3-2,Amy>鉴于你的酒后乱性程度
<3-2,Amy>Smart idea considering how trampy you get

108
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,450
<3-2,Amy>这么做很聪明
<3-2,Amy>when you've had a few.

109
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,720
<3-3,Penny>你听说我干的事了
<3-3,Penny>You heard what I did?

110
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
<3-4,Amy>我听说你干了谁了

<3-5,Penny>我伤害了莱纳德
<3-5,Penny>I hurt Leonard.

114
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,620
<3-5,Penny>我伤害了拉杰

<3-5,Penny>我真是有毛病啊我
<3-5,Penny>I mean, what is wrong with me?

116
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,800
<3-5,Penny>我感觉自己完全是两个不同的人
<3-5,Penny>I feel like two totally different people--

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,620
<3-5,Penny>化娼博士
<3-5,Penny>Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.

119
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,340
<3-6,Amy>别太自责了
<3-6,Amy>Don't be so hard on yourself.

120
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,130
<3-6,Amy>你知道凯萨琳大帝的故事吗
<3-6,Amy>Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?

121
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,350
<3-7,Penny>不知道
<3-7,Penny>No.

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,910
<3-8,Amy>18世纪后期的统治者

124
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,630
<3-8,Amy>一天晚上  她感觉性欲特别强
<3-8,Amy>when she was feeling particularly randy,

125
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,610
<3-8,Amy>她用一个复杂的滑轮系统
<3-8,Amy>she used an intricate system of pulleys

126
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,450
<3-8,Amy>跟一匹马发生了亲密关系
<3-8,Amy>to have intimate relations with a horse.

127
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,610
<3-8,Amy>不好意思
<3-8,Amy>I'm... I'm sorry.

128
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,680
<3-9,Penny>这跟我有什么关系
<3-9,Penny>What does this have to do with me?

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,970
<3-10,Amy>她跟不同物种发生过关系
<3-10,Amy>She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky,

130
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,510
<3-10,Amy>但人们依然尊称她"大帝"啊
<3-10,Amy>and people still call her "Great."

131
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,000
<3-10,Amy>我相信你的名誉不会因为
<3-10,Amy>I'm sure your reputation can survive

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,200
<3-10,Amy>一个小印度男而毁掉的
<3-10,Amy>you shagging a little Indian boy.

133
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,090
<4-1,Bernadette>你个不要脸的东西
<4-1,Bernadette>You jerk face!

134
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,310
<4-1,Bernadette>你跟霍华德说什么了
<4-1,Bernadette>What did you tell Howard?!

135
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,340
<4-1,Bernadette>你跟他说我们之间有奸情是不是
<4-1,Bernadette>Did you say there was something going on between us?

136
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,490
<4-1,Bernadette>他现在就是这么想的
<4-1,Bernadette>Because he thinks there is!

137
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,730
<4-1,Bernadette>他整个人都抓狂了
<4-1,Bernadette>He's completely freaking out!

<4-5,Bernadette>我对谁都这么好啊

<4-7,Bernadette>And you tell Howard there's never been anything between us!

146
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,510
<4-10,Raj>你觉得我和佩妮有机会吗
<4-10,Raj>Do you think I have a shot with Penny?

147
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,640
<4-11,Bernadette>当然啦  你那么可爱
<4-11,Bernadette>Of course you do. You're a cutie pie!

148
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,710
<4-11,Bernadette>哪个女孩子遇到你真是三生有幸啦
<4-11,Bernadette>Any girl would be lucky to have you!

149
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,470
<5-1,Penny>你知道吗  我以前就犯过这种错
<5-1,Penny>You know, I've done this before.

150
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,340
<5-1,Penny>在幼儿园的时候
<5-1,Penny>In kindergarten,

151
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,570
<5-1,Penny>我本来要在下课期间嫁给杰森·索伦森
<5-1,Penny>I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess,

152
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,080
<5-1,Penny>但等同学们都出来的时候
<5-1,Penny>but by the time my class got out there,

153
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,100
<5-1,Penny>他已经和切尔西·辛莫法订婚了
<5-1,Penny>he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb.

154
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
<5-1,Penny>知道我怎么做吗
<5-1,Penny>So what did I do?

155
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,260
<5-1,Penny>我倒吊在猴架上
<5-1,Penny>Hung upside down from the monkey bars,

156
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,010
<5-1,Penny>让全部男生看我的内裤
<5-1,Penny>let all the boys see my underpants.

157
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,510
<5-2,Amy>你不能责怪自己
<5-2,Amy>You can't blame yourself.

158
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,830
<5-2,Amy>当你的前额皮质无法使你开心时
<5-2,Amy>When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy,

159
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,040
<5-2,Amy>滥交能给你带来大量所需的多巴胺
<5-2,Amy>promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine.

160
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,830
<5-2,Amy>我们神经生物学家称之为"下流反射"
<5-2,Amy>We neurobiologists refer to this as the "Skank reflex."

161
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,100
<5-3,Penny>这样吧
<5-3,Penny>You know what?

162
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,210
<5-3,Penny>我们出去玩
<5-3,Penny>Let's get out of here.

163
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,170
<5-4,Amy>我们去哪玩
<5-4,Amy>Where are we going?

164
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,170
<5-5,Penny>去没有人看过我裸体的地方
<5-5,Penny>Somewhere where no one's seen me naked.

165
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,710
<5-5,Penny>可能得开一会车才行
<5-5,Penny>We may have to drive awhile.

166
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,840
<5-6,Sheldon>聪敏就不是她的强项  对吧
<5-6,Sheldon>Subtlety isn't her strong suit, is it?

167
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,980
<5-7,Penny>我能去你家睡几晚吗
<5-7,Penny>Can I stay at your place for a few nights?

168
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,260
<5-8,Amy>真的吗
<5-8,Amy>Really?

169
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,090
<5-8,Amy>闺蜜来过夜  好嘢
<5-8,Amy>A best friend sleepover? Yay.

170
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,360
<5-9,Penny>当然  好嘢
<5-9,Penny>Yeah, sure. Yay!

171
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,150
<5-10,Amy>我们弄点爆米花  玩他个通宵
<5-10,Amy>We'll make popcorn, stay up all night

172
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,090
<5-10,Amy>我会教你说我的密语  表嗷话
<5-10,Amy>and I'll teach you my secret language, Op.

173
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,390
<5-11,Penny>-听上去不错  -错
<5-11,Penny>- Sounds great.  - Nope.

174
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,740
<5-12,Amy>应该是听上去"表嗷错噢"
<5-12,Amy>Sounds "Gop Rop E A Top."

175
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,010
<5-13,Penny>-好吧  我去收个包  -不  错了
<5-13,Penny>- Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.  - No, you're not.

176
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,040
<5-14,Amy>你是去"收个表嗷噢"
<5-14,Amy>You're gonna "Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."

177
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,010
<6-1,Leonard>我们真要穿这蠢爆了的迷彩服
<6-1,Leonard>Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap

178
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,700
<6-1,Leonard>去打彩弹吗
<6-1,Leonard>to play paintball?

179
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,310
<6-2,Sheldon>谁在说话
<6-2,Sheldon>Who said that?

180
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,920
<6-2,Sheldon>莱纳德  我能听到你
<6-2,Sheldon>Leonard, I can hear your voice,

181
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,720
<6-2,Sheldon>但看不到你
<6-2,Sheldon>but I can't see you.

182
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,970
<6-3,Leonard>我没那心情  谢尔顿
<6-3,Leonard>I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.

183
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,210
<6-4,Sheldon>哎呀  你在这啊
<6-4,Sheldon>Oh, there you are!

184

<6-4,Sheldon>莱纳德
<6-4,Sheldon>Leonard,

185
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,070
<6-4,Sheldon>我知道你为最近的事不开心
<6-4,Sheldon>I know you're upset about recent events, and

186
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,800
<6-4,Sheldon>所以我找了人来帮你
<6-4,Sheldon>I have someone here to help.

187
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,980
<6-5,Leonard>我不想和艾米说话
<6-5,Leonard>I don't want to talk to Amy.

188
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,240
<6-6,Sheldon>不  那不是艾米
<6-6,Sheldon>No, it's not Amy.

<6-9,Sheldon>Oh, Leonard,

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,250
<6-9,Sheldon>非要说得这么明显吗
<6-9,Sheldon>is it really necessary to caption the obvious?

193
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,840
<6-10,Dr Hofstadter>他还是小孩时就这样了
<6-10,Dr Hofstadter>He's been like that since he was a toddler.

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,950
<6-10,Dr Hofstadter>看呀  妈咪  一只蝴蝶
<6-10,Dr Hofstadter>"Look, Mommy-- a butterfly."

<6-11,Leonard>What's going on? What do you want?

197
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,080
<6-12,Dr Hofstadter>谢尔顿告诉我说
<6-12,Dr Hofstadter>Sheldon informed me

198
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,510
<6-12,Dr Hofstadter>你正在遭遇感情上的剧变
<6-12,Dr Hofstadter>that you're experiencing an emotional upheaval,

<6-13,Leonard>That's so nice.

201
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,240
<6-14,Dr Hofstadter>这不又是明摆着的么
<6-14,Dr Hofstadter>And we're back to the obvious.

202
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,960
<6-14,Dr Hofstadter>好吧  怎么了
<6-14,Dr Hofstadter>Now, what's up?

205
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,060
<6-15,Leonard>我们尝试过  很疯狂  效果很糟糕
<6-15,Leonard>We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work,

206
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,280
<6-15,Leonard>但我也不能接受
<6-15,Leonard>but I can't deal with the fact

207
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,780
<6-15,Leonard>她和我朋友拉杰上床了
<6-15,Leonard>that she slept with my friend Raj.

<7-1,Amy>秀发如金色瀑布一般倾泻而下
<7-1,Amy>It's like a waterfall of liquid gold.

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,610
<7-2,Penny>要住在洛杉矶
<7-2,Penny>of me staying in L.A. Is.

<7-2,Penny>一个做痔疮广告的打了电话给我

234
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,100
<7-4,Penny>你也觉得吧
<7-4,Penny>I know, right?

235
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,500
<7-4,Penny>我是不是干脆搬回内布拉斯加得了
<7-4,Penny>Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.

236
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,590
<7-5,Amy>不  你不能这么做
<7-5,Amy>No, I can't let you do that.

<7-7,Amy>And no pressure,

241
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,650
<7-7,Amy>但你要是走了  这一切都完了

<7-16,Raj>I was wondering if you're free Friday.

254
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,000
<7-16,Raj>周五在格里克有个八十年代之夜
<7-16,Raj>They're having a Totally '80s Night at the Greek.

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,560
<7-16,Raj>有霍尔与奥兹二重唱  卡特琳娜
<7-16,Raj>Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves

257
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,180
<7-16,Raj>还有卡加勾勾组合里的三个人
<7-16,Raj>and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.

258
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,930
<7-17,Penny>这真的很不错  但问题是...
<7-17,Penny>Gee, that's really sweet, but the thing is...

259
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,980
<7-18,Raj>有问题了
<7-18,Raj>Aw, there's a thing.

260
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,970
<7-19,Penny>听着  亲爱的  我当时醉得很厉害
<7-19,Penny>Look, honey, I was really drunk

261
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,600
<7-19,Penny>昨晚犯了个严重的错误
<7-19,Penny>and made a huge mistake last night.

262
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,370
<7-19,Penny>我们绝不该发生这种关系
<7-19,Penny>We should've never slept together.

263
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,470
<7-19,Penny>这会毁了我们的友谊的
<7-19,Penny>It's what ruins friendships.

264
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,380
<7-20,Raj>做爱是毁不了友谊的
<7-20,Raj>You can't ruin a friendship with sex.

265
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,910
<7-20,Raj>就好像巧克力屑不会毁了冰淇淋一样
<7-20,Raj>That's like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.

266
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,750
<7-21,Penny>来坐下来
<7-21,Penny>Come here.

267
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,180
<7-21,Penny>听我说
<7-21,Penny>Just listen to me.

268
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,420
<7-21,Penny>我想时光倒流  回到我们从前那样
<7-21,Penny>I want to go back to the way we were before.

269
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,700
<7-21,Penny>当朋友
<7-21,Penny>You know, friends.

270
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,440
<7-21,Penny>不放巧克力屑
<7-21,Penny>No sprinkles.

271
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,420
<7-22,Raj>好吧
<7-22,Raj>All right.

272
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,090
<7-23,Penny>谢谢你
<7-23,Penny>Thank you.

273
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:07,580
<7-24,Raj>作为朋友  我要告诉你
<7-24,Raj>As your friend, you might like to know that, um...

274
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,450
<7-24,Raj>传统意义上来说  我们没有做爱
<7-24,Raj>we didn't have sex in the conventional sense.

275
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,290
<7-25,Penny>天哪
<7-25,Penny>Oh, God.

276
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,350
<7-25,Penny>你对我做了什么怪异的印度花样吗
<7-25,Penny>Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?

277
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,950
<7-26,Raj>不  不是的
<7-26,Raj>No, no.

278
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,010
<7-26,Raj>我们脱光衣服上床之后
<7-26,Raj>After we got undressed and jumped in bed,

279
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,810
<7-26,Raj>你问了我有没有带安全套
<7-26,Raj>you-you asked if I had protection.

280
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,860
<7-27,Penny>哦  你一定带了  是吧
<7-27,Penny>Oh, you did, didn't you?

281
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,870
<7-28,Raj>当然  我一向随身带着的
<7-28,Raj>Of course. I'm always packing.

282
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,160
<7-28,Raj>总之
<7-28,Raj>Anyway,

283
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,190
<7-28,Raj>当时我有点戴不上套子
<7-28,Raj>um, I had trouble putting it on

284
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,630
<7-28,Raj>你就想来帮我
<7-28,Raj>and you tried to help and...

285
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,760
<7-28,Raj>然后就没有然后了
<7-28,Raj>that was all she wrote.

286
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,280
<7-29,Penny>所以  我们其实没有...
<7-29,Penny>So, we didn't actually...

287
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,050
<7-29,Penny>我射了
<7-29,Penny>I did.

288
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,080
<7-30,Raj>感觉很美妙
<7-30,Raj>It was beautiful.

289
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,730
<7-32,Raj>佩妮  求求你答应我
<7-32,Raj>Penny, please, please promise me

290
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,790
<7-32,Raj>不会告诉任何人
<7-32,Raj>you won't tell anybody about this.

291
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,610
<7-33,Penny>当然  一定不说
<7-33,Penny>Of course I won't. No, I won't.

292
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,360
<7-34,Raj>太好了
<7-34,Raj>Oh, good.

293
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,860
<7-34,Raj>我可不可以告诉别人
<7-34,Raj>Um, can I tell people that our love

294
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,450
<7-34,Raj>我们的爱燃烧太快  转瞬即逝
<7-34,Raj>burned too bright and too quickly?

295
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,030
<7-34,Raj>就像"风中之烛"那样
<7-34,Raj>Kind of a "Candle in the Wind" deal?

296
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,070
<7-35,Penny>当然可以
<7-35,Penny>Sure.

297
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,210
<7-36,Raj>酷  我可以说我们分手
<7-36,Raj>Cool. Can I say it fell apart

298
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,080
<7-36,Raj>是因为你一直嚷嚷着想要我孩子
<7-36,Raj>because you were all "I want to have your babies""

299
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,270
<7-36,Raj>而我觉得自己还要继续流浪不能安定下来吗
<7-36,Raj>and I was like "I'm too rock and roll to be tied down"?

300
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,890
<7-37,Penny>不行
<7-37,Penny>No.

301
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,490
<7-38,Raj>我可以说因为你是白种人  所以我甩了你吗
<7-38,Raj>Can I say I ruined you for white men?

302
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,610
<7-39,Penny>还是不行
<7-39,Penny>Also no.

303
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,330
<7-40,Raj>-好吧  就说风中烛那个吧  -对
<7-40,Raj>- Okay, just the candle thing. - Yeah.

304
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,510
<7-42,Raj>酷
<7-42,Raj>Cool.

305
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,860
<7-42,Raj>好吧  朋友
<7-42,Raj>All right... friend.

306
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,180
<7-44,Raj>回见
<7-44,Raj>I'll see you around.

307
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,760
<7-44,Raj>好的
<7-44,Raj>Okay.

308
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,650
<7-45,Penny>拉杰  等等
<7-45,Penny>Raj, wait.

309
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,870
<7-45,Penny>谢谢你当我朋友
<7-45,Penny>Thank you for being my friend.

310
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,130
<7-46,Raj>佩妮
<7-46,Raj>Penny?

311
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,610
<7-48,Raj>我又开始觉得美妙了
<7-48,Raj>It's getting beautiful again.

312
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,150
<8-1,Sheldon>好了  这是本战场的"谷歌地球"画面
<8-1,Sheldon>All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.

313
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,110
<8-2,Howard>我什么都没看见
<8-2,Howard>I don't see anything.

314
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,240
<8-3,Sheldon>等一会  在载入
<8-3,Sheldon>Give it a second to load.

315
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,550
<8-3,Sheldon>可以了吧  AT&T[美国电话电报公司]
<8-3,Sheldon>Whenever you're ready, AT&T!

316
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,260
<8-3,Sheldon>好了  来吧
<8-3,Sheldon>Okay, here we go.

317
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
<8-3,Sheldon>我们在这
<8-3,Sheldon>This is us here.

318
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,490
<8-3,Sheldon>南面是卢米斯教授和地质系诸人
<8-3,Sheldon>To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department.

319
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,440
<8-3,Sheldon>据其twitter记录  他们没防晒霜了
<8-3,Sheldon>According to their twitter feed, they're out of sunblock,

320
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,390
<8-3,Sheldon>就是说他们要不躲在林木线下
<8-3,Sheldon>which means they'll have to hug the tree line

321
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,560
<8-3,Sheldon>不然就有得黑色素瘤危险
<8-3,Sheldon>or risk melanoma.

322
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,770
<8-3,Sheldon>这就是我们的优势
<8-3,Sheldon>That's our edge.

323
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,700
<8-3,Sheldon>我们只需要快速穿过这个山脊
<8-3,Sheldon>All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge,

324
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,610
<8-3,Sheldon>就能把这帮崇拜石头  苍白脸色的混蛋
<8-3,Sheldon>the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards

325
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,540
<8-3,Sheldon>出其不意地击倒
<8-3,Sheldon>won't know what hit them!

326
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,260
<8-4,Leonard>好了  出发吧
<8-4,Leonard>All right, let's move out.

327
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,350
<8-4,Leonard>等等  谢尔顿
<8-4,Leonard>Hang on, Sheldon.

328
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,930
<8-4,Leonard>你怎么能不告诉我  你妹妹要回印度
<8-4,Leonard>How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?

329
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,760
<8-5,Howard>也许他当时正忙着
<8-5,Howard>Maybe he was too busy

330
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,810
<8-5,Howard>写关于我未婚妻的拙劣阴茎隐喻
<8-5,Howard>writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiance.

331
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,600
<8-6,Raj>滚你的
<8-6,Raj>Screw you.

332
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,260
<8-6,Raj>那明明是绝妙的阴茎隐喻
<8-6,Raj>That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.

333
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,030
<8-7,Leonard>各位  我实在没心情打彩弹球
<8-7,Leonard>You know what, guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball.

334
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,700
<8-7,Leonard>不如我们直接当逃兵吧
<8-7,Leonard>What do you say we just bag it?

335
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,270
<8-8,Howard>-我同意  -好吧  随便
<8-8,Howard>- Fine with me. - Sure, whatever.

336
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,790
<8-10,Sheldon>不能当逃兵
<8-10,Sheldon>You can't quit.

337
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,320
<8-10,Sheldon>这样是要交军事法庭审判的罪行
<8-10,Sheldon>That's a court-martial offense.

338
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,890
<8-10,Sheldon>可被判处...
<8-10,Sheldon>That's punishable by...

339
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,530
<8-10,Sheldon>反正不行
<8-10,Sheldon>You can't quit.

340
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,560
<8-11,Leonard>抱歉谢尔顿
<8-11,Leonard>Sorry, Sheldon,

341
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,140
<8-11,Leonard>现在玩彩弹球游戏实在不是时候
<8-11,Leonard>it's just not a good time for playing games.

342
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,000
<8-12,Sheldon>你以为这是游戏吗
<8-12,Sheldon>This is a game to you?

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,250
<8-12,Sheldon>安提耶坦之战也是游戏吗
<8-12,Sheldon>Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game?

345
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,000
<8-12,Sheldon>罗马被洗劫也是游戏吗
<8-12,Sheldon>Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,370
<8-13,Leonard>是  不是  不是
<8-13,Leonard>Yes, no and no.

348
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,630
<8-13,Leonard>慢着
<8-13,Leonard>Wait.

349
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,770
<8-14,Sheldon>我只是想你们知道  我原谅你们了
<8-14,Sheldon>I just want you all to know that I forgive you.

350
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,110
<8-14,Sheldon>这次叛变不是你们的错
<8-14,Sheldon>This mutiny isn't your fault,

351
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,670
<8-14,Sheldon>是我的问题
<8-14,Sheldon>it's mine.

352
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,210
<8-14,Sheldon>我配不上这些两道杠[军衔]
<8-14,Sheldon>I haven't earned these bars.

353
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,370
<8-14,Sheldon>显然我的领导才能的不足
<8-14,Sheldon>Although what I lack in leadership,

354
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,920
<8-14,Sheldon>全弥补在缝纫技术上了
<8-14,Sheldon>apparently I more than make up for in sewing.

355
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,640
<8-14,Sheldon>算了吧  谢尔顿
<8-14,Sheldon>Let it go, Sheldon.

357
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,340
<8-15,Howard>回家的路上我会给你买杯丈八果汁的
<8-15,Howard>I'll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.

358
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,730
<8-13,Leonard>不要
<8-13,Leonard>No.

359
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,430
<8-16,Sheldon>丈八果汁是给英雄喝的
<8-16,Sheldon>Jamba Juice is for heroes.

360
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,350
<8-16,Sheldon>所以我们要当英雄
<8-16,Sheldon>And that's what we're going to be.

361
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,010
<8-17,Leonard>你要干嘛
<8-17,Leonard>What are you doing?

362
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,310
<8-18,Sheldon>步柯克船长和嘎嘣脆船长  以及袋鼠船长的后尘
<8-18,Sheldon>Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.

363
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,790
<8-18,Sheldon>地质学不是真正的科学
<8-18,Sheldon>Geology isn't a real science!

364
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,770
<8-19,Howard>那帮混球太过分了
<8-19,Howard>Damn those sons of bitches!

365
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,260
<8-20,Leonard>干掉他们
<8-20,Leonard>Let's get 'em!

366
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,150
<8-20,Leonard>尝尝老子的厉害
<8-20,Leonard>Eat paint!

367
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,040
<8-21,Sheldon>如果将来有谢尔顿党的话
<8-21,Sheldon>If there's ever a Church of Sheldon,

368
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,260
<8-21,Sheldon>那应该就是从此时开始的
<8-21,Sheldon>this will be when it started.

369
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,550
<8-21,Sheldon>哎呦喂
<8-21,Sheldon>Ow!

370
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,400
<9-1,Leonard>让我们为英雄举杯
<9-1,Leonard>I'd like to propose a toast

371
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,100
<9-1,Leonard>正是他悲壮的牺牲  我们才能赢得胜利
<9-1,Leonard>to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory,

372
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,860
<9-1,Leonard>感谢谢尔顿·库珀上尉
<9-1,Leonard>Captain Sheldon Cooper.

373
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,800
<9-2,Howard and Raj>-说得好  -说得妙
<9-2,Howard and Raj>- Hear, hear. - Hear, hear.

374
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,060
<9-3,Sheldon>抱歉  应该是谢尔顿·库珀少校
<9-3,Sheldon>Excuse me. It's Major Sheldon Cooper.

375
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,010
<9-3,Sheldon>为了犒赏在沙场上的英勇
