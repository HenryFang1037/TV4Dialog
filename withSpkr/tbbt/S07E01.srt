<1-3,Leonard>什么事
<1-3,Leonard>What is it?

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,870
<1-4,Sheldon>《回到未来》第二部光盘被放到
<1-4,Sheldon>Back to the Future II was

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,780
<1-4,Sheldon>《回到未来》第三部的盒子里了
<1-4,Sheldon>in the Back to the Future III case...

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,250
<1-4,Sheldon>而《回到未来》第三部  你猜怎么着
<1-4,Sheldon>and Back to the Future III was-- get this--

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,340
<1-4,Sheldon>被放在了第二部的盒子里了
<1-4,Sheldon>in the Back to the Future II case.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,880
<1-5,Leonard>所以呢
<1-5,Leonard>So?

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,580
<1-6,Sheldon>所以是你干的吗
<1-6,Sheldon>So, did you do that,

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,060
<1-6,Sheldon>还是我住的房子里有个入侵者
<1-6,Sheldon>or am I in the house with an intruder?

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,270
<1-7,Leonard>谢尔顿  我要先进船舱了
<1-7,Leonard>Sheldon, I got to go inside.

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,960
<1-7,Leonard>外头风浪太大了
<1-7,Leonard>It's getting rough out here.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,210
<1-8,Sheldon>你在闪避问题
<1-8,Sheldon>You're dodging the question;

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,930
<1-8,Sheldon>我就知道是你干的
<1-8,Sheldon>I knew it was you.

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,090
<1-8,Sheldon>那是什么声音
<1-8,Sheldon>What was that?

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,280
<1-9,Leonard>什么什么声音
<1-9,Leonard>What was what?

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,720
<1-10,Sheldon>信号不是太好
<1-10,Sheldon>This isn't a very good connection,

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,170
<1-10,Sheldon>但感觉像海怪被释放出来了
<1-10,Sheldon>but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,910
<1-11,Leonard>好了  我要挂电话了
<1-11,Leonard>Okay, I'm hanging up now.

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,280
<1-11,Leonard>你知道世界上没有海...
<1-11,Leonard>You know there's no such thing as a...

24

<1-12,Sheldon>别啊

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,660
<2-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<2-1,Sheldon>Penny...!

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,080
<2-2,Penny>怎么了
<2-2,Penny>What's the matter?

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,120
<2-3,Sheldon>我刚刚有点担心
<2-3,Sheldon>Um... well, I was worried

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,120
<2-3,Sheldon>你会很想念莱纳德
<2-3,Sheldon>that you might be missing Leonard.

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,380
<2-3,Sheldon>然后会害你做恶梦
<2-3,Sheldon>And that might be causing you to have bad dreams,

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,730
<2-3,Sheldon>就是那种睡前看了
<2-3,Sheldon>like the kind you'd get if you watched

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,030
<2-3,Sheldon>《诸神之战》之类的电影会做的恶梦
<2-3,Sheldon>Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.

34
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,140
<2-4,Penny>亲爱的  是不是你做恶梦了啦
<2-4,Penny>Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,010
<2-5,Sheldon>老实说  是的
<2-5,Sheldon>To be honest, I did.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,090
<2-6,Penny>《回到未来》第二部光盘
<2-6,Penny>Back to the Future II was

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,310
<2-6,Penny>被放进第三部的盒子里
<2-6,Penny>in the Back to the Future III case.

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,430
<2-7,Sheldon>莱纳德干的
<2-7,Sheldon>Leonard did it.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,400
<2-8,Penny>晚安
<2-8,Penny>Good night.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,890
<2-9,Sheldon>等等
<2-9,Sheldon>No, wait.

41
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,700
<2-9,Sheldon>我是不是应该睡在这边
<2-9,Sheldon>Perhaps I should sleep here

42
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,580
<2-9,Sheldon>这样你不会太想念莱纳德
<2-9,Sheldon>so you don't miss Leonard as much,

43
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,330
<2-9,Sheldon>因为你现在就跟小孩一样楚楚可怜
<2-9,Sheldon>uh, 'cause you're being kind of a baby about it.

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,700
<2-10,Penny>好好好  你待着会让我舒服很多
<2-10,Penny>You know what? That would make me feel better.

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,590
<2-9,Sheldon>-谢谢你啊  -不用客气
<2-9,Sheldon>- Thank you. - You're welcome.

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,980
<3-1,Raj>形状就跟我前女友露西一模一样
<3-1,Raj>that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,

60
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,770
<3-1,Raj>但我心情完全没受影响

<3-4,Sheldon>我的老天爷啊  你是个天文学家
<3-4,Sheldon>Dear Lord! You're an astronomer.

<3-4,Sheldon>虽然你也有着人世间的烦恼
<3-4,Sheldon>Although you may have earthly woes,

65
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,550
<3-4,Sheldon>但你的脑子得想着天上繁星啊
<3-4,Sheldon>get your mind back on the stars.

66
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,310
<3-4,Sheldon>就连低等生物屎壳郎
<3-4,Sheldon>Gee, even the lowly dung beetle

67
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,420
<3-4,Sheldon>推粪的路线  都是以银河繁星作为指引
<3-4,Sheldon>chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.

69
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,210
<3-6,Sheldon>我说的一切都是真的

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,320
<3-6,Sheldon>当然啦  屎壳郎也喜欢

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,730
<3-6,Sheldon>食粪  住粪里
<3-6,Sheldon>eating feces, living in feces

72
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,990
<3-6,Sheldon>然后把粪便做成球
<3-6,Sheldon>and making little balls out of feces.

73
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,100
<3-6,Sheldon>自己选择

00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,860
<3-8,Raj>你看这个鸡肉派的外皮

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,470
<3-8,Raj>你能否认没看到她那笑容吗
<3-8,Raj>in the crust of this chicken pot pie.

<5-9,Sheldon>Well, I try.

132
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,160
<5-10,Penny>好啦  赶紧把这破游戏玩完吧
<5-10,Penny>All right, let's just get this stupid game over with.

134
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,630
<5-13,Sheldon>对了  你懂拉链吗
<5-13,Sheldon>By the way, how are you with zippers?

135
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,230
<5-14,Penny>怎么了
<5-14,Penny>Why?

136
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,820
<5-15,Sheldon>我真的得去上厕所了
<5-15,Sheldon>Well, I really need to go to the bathroom,

137
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,520
<5-15,Sheldon>可是这个拉链要整死我了
<5-15,Sheldon>and this one's gone all cattywampus.

138
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,230
<6-1,Raj>你的水母神经网络研究
<6-1,Raj>Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets

139
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,900
<6-1,Raj>听起来蛮有意思的
<6-1,Raj>sounds so interesting.

140
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,920
<6-1,Raj>的确
<6-1,Raj>It is.

141
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,600
<6-2,Girl>你可以在学校伺服器上下到我的研究报告
<6-2,Girl>You can download my paper off the university server.

142
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,770
<6-3,Raj>会的  你也可以在学校伺服器上
<6-3,Raj>I will. You can download my paper

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,640
<6-3,Raj>下到我的范艾伦辐射带研究报告
<6-3,Raj>on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.

<6-4,Girl>会的
<6-4,Girl>I will.

145
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,290
<6-5,Raj>好的
<6-5,Raj>All right.

146
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,330
<6-6,Howard>怎么样了
<6-6,Howard>How'd it go?

147
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,440
<6-7,Raj>如果你喜欢无趣与论述事实
<6-7,Raj>Well, if you like dry, factual statements

148
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
<6-7,Raj>外加各种蛋疼的无语时分的交谈
<6-7,Raj>interspersed with painful moments of silence,

149
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,750
<6-7,Raj>那就绝对是爽歪歪了
<6-7,Raj>it was bananas.

150
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,650
<6-8,Howard>看那边
<6-8,Howard>Check it out.

151
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,260
<6-8,Howard>人力资源部的戴维斯女士也在
<6-8,Howard>Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here.

152
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,580
<6-8,Howard>估计是来盯着有没有性骚扰案件的
<6-8,Howard>She's probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.

153
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,580
<6-9,Raj>漂亮
<6-9,Raj>Oh, great.

154
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,600
<6-9,Raj>这下我被人性骚扰的机会也飞了
<6-9,Raj>There go my chances of being sexually harassed.

155
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,360
<6-10,Howard>听说她老公泡了性感年轻女大生  甩了她
<6-10,Howard>I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.

156
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,980
<6-11,Raj>的确是比那个老丑货好超多啊
<6-11,Raj>That's so much better than the old, ugly ones.

157
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,310
<6-12,Mrs Davis>沃罗威茨先生
<6-12,Mrs Davis>Mr. Wolowitz,

158
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,460
<6-12,Mrs Davis>库萨帕里博士
<6-12,Mrs Davis>Dr. Koothrappali.

159
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,390
<6-13,Howard>戴维斯女士  你也好
<6-13,Howard>Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.

160
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,580
<6-14,Raj>我最近刚阅读了一篇有关企鹅中
<6-14,Raj>You know, I recently read a fascinating article

161
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,250
<6-14,Raj>也有雄性出轨情况的文章
<6-14,Raj>on infidelity among penguins.

162
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,870
<6-15,Mrs Davis>好的
<6-15,Mrs Davis>Okay.

163
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,450
<6-16,Raj>所以你老公离开你的这事
<6-16,Raj>So if the fact that your husband left you

164
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,260
<6-16,Raj>可能让你觉得自己年老色衰  但请想想
<6-16,Raj>makes you feel unattractive, just remember,

165
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,080
<6-16,Raj>连企鹅这么超可爱还会被雄性骗呢
<6-16,Raj>penguins get cheated on, and they're adorable.

166
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,210
<6-17,Howard>我宁愿你不能跟女人说话
<6-17,Howard>It was better when you couldn't talk to women.

167
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,200
<7-1,Bernadette>我打算去听听那场
<7-1,Bernadette>I was thinking of going to the lecture

168
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,500
<7-1,Bernadette>后扣带回皮质损伤
<7-1,Bernadette>on posterior cingulate cortex lesions

169
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,400
<7-1,Bernadette>对自传体记忆的形成课程
<7-1,Bernadette>in the formation of autobiographical memory.

170
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,390
<7-2,Amy>大脑损伤是很有意思啊
<7-2,Amy>Oh, brain lesions are fascinating.

171
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,190
<7-2,Amy>但如果是你的脑子  那就倒霉了
<7-2,Amy>Unless they're yours, then they're a drag.

172
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,300
<7-3,Bernadette>敬科学进步一杯
<7-3,Bernadette>To the advancement of science.

173
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,300
<7-4,Amy>也敬成就了这些的病人和死人
<7-4,Amy>And to the sick and dying who make it possible.

174
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,150
<7-5,Bernadette>这真不错  佩妮在的时候
<7-5,Bernadette>This is fun; we never really get to talk shop

175
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,240
<7-5,Bernadette>我们从没机会谈正事
<7-5,Bernadette>with Penny around.

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,340
<7-5,Bernadette>到最后都是在谈男人的事
<7-5,Bernadette>We usually just end up talking about boys.

177
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,340
<7-6,Amy>是也没关系啦  但偶尔能聊点
<7-6,Amy>Which is fine, but it's nice to mix it up

178
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,850
<7-6,Amy>高智商的东西也不错
<7-6,Amy>with a little intellectual conversation.

179
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,020
<7-7,Waiter>吧台边的两位男士请的
<7-7,Waiter>From the two gentlemen at the bar.

180
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,620
<7-8,Amy>天啊  有男生请我们喝酒
<7-8,Amy>Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks!

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,240
<7-8,Amy>男生请我们喝酒

00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,540
<7-9,Bernadette>-冷静  -冷静什么
<7-9,Bernadette>- Be cool. - You be cool!

184
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,490
<7-10,Amy>他们不是为了泡佩妮  才来泡我们的呢
<7-10,Amy>Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.

185
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,020
<7-10,Amy>你说的有道理
<7-10,Amy>You're right.

186
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,470
<7-11,Bernadette>谢谢啊
<7-11,Bernadette>Thank you.

187
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,650
<8-1,Sheldon>坏棋啊
<8-1,Sheldon>Bad move.

188
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,810
<8-2,Penny>真的吗  为什么
<8-2,Penny>Really? Why?

189
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,240
<8-3,Sheldon>我的王后可以从下面吃掉你的车
<8-3,Sheldon>My queen can now take your rook from below.

190
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,760
<8-4,Penny>也就表示我输了  对吧
<8-4,Penny>So that means I lose, right?

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
<8-4,Penny>结束啦
<8-4,Penny>It's over!

192
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,030
<8-5,Sheldon>如果我下这步才会
<8-5,Sheldon>If I make this move...

193
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,890
<8-5,Sheldon>但我不会  因为我们玩得正开心呢
<8-5,Sheldon>but I won't because we're having too much fun.

194
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,130
<8-6,Penny>好吧  先休息一下
<8-6,Penny>Okay, let's take a break.

195
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,890
<8-7,Sheldon>我们家没酒了
<8-7,Sheldon>We're all out of alcohol.

196
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,560
<8-8,Penny>我不是要去拿酒好吗
<8-8,Penny>I wasn't going to get alcohol.

197
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,380
<8-8,Penny>天啊  我好想知道莱纳德现在在干嘛
<8-8,Penny>Gosh, I wonder what Leonard's doing right now.

198
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,180
<8-8,Penny>我好想他
<8-8,Penny>I miss him so much.

199
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,910
<8-8,Penny>你要是想

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,420
<8-9,Sheldon>我是说  你可以打给他
<8-9,Sheldon>I-I mean that you could call him.

<8-9,Sheldon>我已经说过
<8-9,Sheldon>As I've explained,

203
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,040
<8-9,Sheldon>我的朋友不在  对我完全没影响
<8-9,Sheldon>the absence of my friends does not cause me pain.

204
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,090
<8-9,Sheldon>就如同摇滚坏男孩  保罗·西蒙唱过的
<8-9,Sheldon>As rock and roll bad boy, Paul Simon, once said,

206
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,120
<8-9,Sheldon>"我是一颗石头

<8-27,Sheldon>是你而已

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,050
<9-2,Bernadette>很好  我再次感谢他们
<9-2,Bernadette>It's fine. I thanked them again

236
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,050
<9-2,Bernadette>并告诉他们我们名花有主了
<9-2,Bernadette>and let them know we're not available.

237
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,700
<9-3,Amy>那就是说我不用为了这杯酒
<9-3,Amy>So I can drink this without having

238
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,800
<9-3,Amy>牺牲色相吗
<9-3,Amy>to give up the goodies?

<9-4,Bernadette>对  你就喝吧
<9-4,Bernadette>Yes, it's all cool.

240
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,070

<9-4,Bernadette>Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them,

241
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,110
<9-4,Bernadette>也没人会怪你的
<9-4,Bernadette>no one would blame you.

242
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,800
<9-5,Amy>为什么没人会怪我
<9-5,Amy>And why would no one blame me?

243
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,040
<9-6,Bernadette>我只是在随便乱说而已
<9-6,Bernadette>I don't know what I'm saying.

244
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,020
<9-7,Amy>貌似你是在说
<9-7,Amy>Well, it sounds like you're saying

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,000
<9-9,Amy>我想知道你那句话到底是什么意思
<9-9,Amy>I want to know what you meant by that.

250
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,630
<9-10,Bernadette>我只是说你还没结婚
<9-10,Bernadette>I just meant that you're not married

251
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,720
<9-10,Bernadette>而且你的男朋友有点...
<9-10,Bernadette>and your boyfriend's kind of...

252
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
<9-10,Bernadette>"谢尔顿"
<9-10,Bernadette>Sheldon.

253
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,960
<9-11,Amy>你的老公还很"霍华德"那型呢
<9-11,Amy>And your husband is extremely Howard.

254
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
<9-11,Amy>你是啥意思呢
<9-11,Amy>What's your point?

255
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,170
<9-12,Bernadette>抱歉  我没没啥意思
<9-12,Bernadette>Sorry. I have no point.

256
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,030
<9-12,Bernadette>刚才是我犯傻乱说话了
<9-12,Bernadette>That was a stupid thing to say.

257
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,290
<9-12,Bernadette>我们能不能既往不咎  回归原样呢
<9-12,Bernadette>Can we please just go back to having a nice time?

258
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,440
<9-13,Amy>本来是可以  但遗憾的是
<9-13,Amy>We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free

259
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,760
<9-13,Amy>我的脑子没病
<9-13,Amy>and I remember that rotten thing

260
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
<9-13,Amy>清楚的记得你说我小宝贝的坏话呢
<9-13,Amy>you just said about my sweet baboo.

261
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,850
<9-14,Bernadette>别这样嘛  我道歉
<9-14,Bernadette>Come on. I apologize.

262
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,030
<9-14,Bernadette>能不能别追究了
<9-14,Bernadette>Can we please just let it go?

263
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,280
<9-15,Amy>-好吧  -谢谢
<9-15,Amy>- Sure. - Thanks.

264
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,090
<9-17,Amy>你老公是个怪胎  他的衣着超级可笑
<9-17,Amy>Your husband's weird and his clothes are ridiculous.

265
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
<10-1,Penny>真是气死我了
<10-1,Penny>I can't believe it!

266
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,370
<10-1,Penny>这段时间我茶不思饭不想
<10-1,Penny>All this time I've been doing nothing

267
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,140
<10-1,Penny>就光想着那个混蛋了
<10-1,Penny>but sit around and miss that guy.

268
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,560
<10-1,Penny>你知道最糟糕的是什么吗
<10-1,Penny>And you know what the worst part is?

269
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,060
<10-2,Sheldon>你得在没有伏特加酒的情况下
<10-2,Sheldon>That you're having to process

270
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,900
<10-2,Sheldon>处理你痛苦的情绪
<10-2,Sheldon>your emotional pain without vodka?

271
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,760
<10-2,Sheldon>才不是呢
<10-2,Sheldon>No.

272
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,770
<10-3,Penny>好啦  被你说中了
<10-3,Penny>Yes.

273
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,760
<10-3,Penny>但你知道第二糟糕的是什么吗
<10-3,Penny>But you know what the second-worst part is?

274
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,350
<10-3,Penny>他一点都不想我
<10-3,Penny>He does not miss me at all.

275
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,330
<10-4,Sheldon>让我来安慰你吧
<10-4,Sheldon>Allow me to comfort you.

276
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,870
<10-4,Sheldon>至少你现在健康地活着
<10-4,Sheldon>At least you've got your health.

277
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,920
<10-5,Penny>不是吧  就这样  这也叫安慰人呀
<10-5,Penny>Really? Tha-That's it? That's comforting?

278
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,270
<10-6,Sheldon>一百年以后
<10-6,Sheldon>Um, uh, in a hundred years,

279
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,550
<10-6,Sheldon>你俩都会死  这事不就无所谓了吗
<10-6,Sheldon>you'll both be dead and it won't matter?

280
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,610
<10-6,Sheldon>去死吧  拜托
<10-6,Sheldon>No! Come on!

281
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,170
<10-7,Penny>你应该说  "他当然想你啦"
<10-7,Penny>You're supposed to say, "Of course he misses you.

282
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,750
<10-7,Penny>"他是在用狂欢来掩盖内心的忧伤"
<10-7,Penny>The only reason he's partying is to cover up his pain."

283
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,670
<10-8,Sheldon>不  我一点都不这么觉得
<10-8,Sheldon>Oh, no, I don't think that's true at all.

284
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,660
<10-9,Penny>这也太荒谬了
<10-9,Penny>This is ridiculous.

285
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,810
<10-9,Penny>为什么我会因为他过得开心而郁闷呀
<10-9,Penny>Why am I upset just because he's off having a good time?

286
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,100
<10-10,Sheldon>可能你像疯子一样想象着
<10-10,Sheldon>Well... perhaps you're obsessively picturing him

287
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,860
<10-10,Sheldon>他跟另外一个女人酒后乱性
<10-10,Sheldon>engaged in drunken coitus with another woman.

288
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,790
<10-10,Sheldon>是这样吗  被我说中了吗
<10-10,Sheldon>Is that it? Did I get it right?

289
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,910
<10-11,Penny>好吧  谢谢你
<10-11,Penny>Okay, tha-that's great.

290
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,000
<10-11,Penny>你可以不用再安慰我了
<10-11,Penny>You can stop trying to make me feel better now.

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,440
<10-12,Sheldon>但是不行
<10-12,Sheldon>Actually, I can't.

292
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,840
<10-12,Sheldon>莱纳德走之前
<10-12,Sheldon>Before Leonard left,

293
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,610
<10-12,Sheldon>他让我答应他  一定要好好照顾你
<10-12,Sheldon>he made me promise that I'd take care of you.

294
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,530
<10-13,Penny>-真的吗  -真的
<10-13,Penny>- He did? - Yes.

295
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,880
<10-15,Penny>真是太贴心了
<10-15,Penny>Oh, that's really sweet.

296
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,240
<10-16,Sheldon>而且如果我做得好的话
<10-16,Sheldon>Plus, if I do a good job,

297
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,420
<10-16,Sheldon>他说回来时会送我一顶水手帽
<10-16,Sheldon>he said he'd bring me back a sailor's cap.

298
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,730
<10-17,Penny>现在我更想念他了
<10-17,Penny>Now I miss him even more.

299
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,510
<10-18,Sheldon>如果能安慰到你的话
<10-18,Sheldon>Well, if it's any consolation,

300
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,980
<10-18,Sheldon>我保证莱纳德离开你温暖的怀抱
<10-18,Sheldon>I'm sure Leonard's tormented every moment

301
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,060
<10-18,Sheldon>和诱人的嘴唇的每一秒  都饱受煎熬
<10-18,Sheldon>he's away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.

302
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,980
<10-19,Penny>谢谢你
<10-19,Penny>Thanks.

303
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,100
<10-20,Sheldon>你还真信呀
<10-20,Sheldon>Oh, seriously?

304
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,280
<11-1,Raj>打扰了  戴维斯女士
<11-1,Raj>Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?

305
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,820
<11-2,Mrs Davis>干嘛
<11-2,Mrs Davis>What?

306
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,910
<11-3,Raj>抱歉我在你面前哪壶不开提哪壶
<11-3,Raj>I'd like to apologize for being insensitive.

307
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,670
<11-3,Raj>还把胸企鹅说得全都是混蛋一样
<11-3,Raj>And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks,

308
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,940
<11-3,Raj>因为他们百分之99都是好男人
<11-3,Raj>'cause 99% of them are stand-up guys.

309
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,240
<11-4,Mrs Davis>算了吧
<11-4,Mrs Davis>Forget about it.

310
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,710
<11-5,Raj>其实我和你
<11-5,Raj>You know, you-you and I,

311
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,300
<11-5,Raj>咱俩有很多共同之处
<11-5,Raj>you and I have a lot in common.

312
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,120
<11-6,Mrs Davis>是吗
<11-6,Mrs Davis>Is that right?

313
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,140
<11-7,Raj>是呀  我也是
<11-7,Raj>Oh, yes, I-I, too,

314
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,920
<11-7,Raj>在经历心碎的痛苦
<11-7,Raj>am in the throes of heartbreak.

315
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,210
<11-7,Raj>好吧  我把来龙去脉告诉你
<11-7,Raj>Okay, fine, I'll tell you about it.

316
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,090
<12-1,Sheldon>这杯热饮是安慰你的
<12-1,Sheldon>Here is a hot beverage to comfort you.

317
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,820
<12-1,Sheldon>用的是外带的杯子
<12-1,Sheldon>It's in a to-go cup.

318
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,770
<12-1,Sheldon>里面装的是"赶紧走"的饮料
<12-1,Sheldon>Make of that what you will.

319
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,590
<12-2,Penny>拜托  现在还早呢
<12-2,Penny>Come on. It's still early.

320
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,130
<12-2,Penny>我们来干点什么吧
<12-2,Penny>Let's do something.

321
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,660
<12-3,Sheldon>我一直在试图创造怎么玩4D象棋呢
<12-3,Sheldon>Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4-D chess.

322
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,140
<12-4,Penny>不如我们来聊聊吧
<12-4,Penny>How about we just talk?

323
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,310
<12-4,Penny>好吧
<12-4,Penny>All right.

324
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,050
<12-5,Sheldon>-在4D象棋...  -不谈这个
<12-5,Sheldon>- In 4-D chess... - No.

325
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,820
<12-6,Penny>来嘛  我们来聊聊彼此的生活
<12-6,Penny>Come on, let's talk about our lives.

326
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,360
<12-6,Penny>告诉我你一些我不知道的事情
<12-6,Penny>Tell me something about you I don't know.

327
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,160
<12-7,Sheldon>我有九条裤子
<12-7,Sheldon>I own nine pairs of pants.

328
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,390
<12-8,Penny>好吧  这算一个良好的开端
<12-8,Penny>Okay, that-that's a good start,

329
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,010
<12-8,Penny>但我想知道点更私密的事情
<12-8,Penny>but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.

330
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,010
<12-9,Sheldon>我懂了
<12-9,Sheldon>I see.

331
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,330
<12-9,Sheldon>我有九条内裤
<12-9,Sheldon>I own nine pairs of underpants.

332
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,150
<12-10,Penny>不如我先说吧
<12-10,Penny>How about I go first?

333
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,330
<12-11,Sheldon>可我不想知道你有多少条内裤
<12-11,Sheldon>But I don't want to know how many underpants you own.

334
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,690
<12-11,Sheldon>但从你卧室的地上看起来
<12-11,Sheldon>Although, based on the floor of your bedroom,

335
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,090
<12-11,Sheldon>我猜有上千条吧
<12-11,Sheldon>I'd say it's a thousand.

336
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,710
<12-12,Penny>好吧  有件事是我不为人知的秘密
<12-12,Penny>Okay, look, here's something people do not know about me.

337
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,800
<12-12,Penny>我刚搬来洛杉矶的时候
<12-12,Penny>When I first moved out to L.A.,

338
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,420
<12-12,Penny>我在一个讲述杀手人猿的
<12-12,Penny>I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie

339
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,620
<12-12,Penny>低成本恐怖电影里裸上身
<12-12,Penny>about a killer gorilla.

340
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,510
<12-12,Penny>在那之后  我觉得很羞愧
<12-12,Penny>After I did it, I felt so ashamed.

341
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,280
<12-12,Penny>但谢天谢地  那电影从没上映
<12-12,Penny>Thankfully, that thing never came out.

342
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,540
<12-13,Sheldon>我看过
<12-13,Sheldon>I've seen that.

343
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,360
<12-13,Sheldon>真的  《杀人恶猿》
<12-13,Sheldon>Yeah. Serial Apeist.

344
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,010
<12-13,Sheldon>在我们遇见你那天  霍华德就在网上发现了
<12-13,Sheldon>Howard found it online the day we met you.

345
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,000
<12-14,Penny>天啊
<12-14,Penny>Oh, God...

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,300
<12-15,Sheldon>确切来说  是在你走出我们这扇门之后
<12-15,Sheldon>And it was literally the moment you walked out the door.

347
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,950
<12-15,Sheldon>但我了解你想知道的是多私密的事情
<12-15,Sheldon>But I see the type of personal revelations you're going for.

348
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,720
<12-15,Sheldon>好吧  有个秘密我本来想带进棺材的
<12-15,Sheldon>Okay, here's one I thought I'd take to the grave.

349
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,530
<12-17,Sheldon>不久前
<12-17,Sheldon>A while back,

350
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,190
<12-17,Sheldon>YouTube网站更改了用户界面
<12-17,Sheldon>YouTube changed its user interface

351
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,490
<12-17,Sheldon>本来是用星级来评价视频
<12-17,Sheldon>from a star-based rating system

352
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,050
<12-17,Sheldon>改成了点赞
<12-17,Sheldon>to a thumbs-up rating system.

353
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,380
<12-17,Sheldon>我告诉人们我无所谓
<12-17,Sheldon>I tell people I'm okay with it,

354
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,000
<12-17,Sheldon>但其实我很介意
<12-17,Sheldon>but I'm really not.

355
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,000
<12-18,Penny>这就是你的大秘密吗
<12-18,Penny>That's your big revelation?

356
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,020
<12-18,Penny>是的
<12-18,Penny>Yes.

357
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,750
<12-19,Sheldon>让我顿时如释重负呀
<12-19,Sheldon>I feel ten pounds lighter.

358
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,890
<12-20,Penny>好吧  算了
<12-20,Penny>Okay, you know what?

359
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,580
<12-20,Penny>我放弃了
<12-20,Penny>I give up.

360
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,250
<12-20,Penny>我回去睡觉了
<12-20,Penny>I'm going to bed.

361
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,020
<12-21,Sheldon>还有一件事你不知道
<12-21,Sheldon>Here's something else you don't know about me:

362
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,120
<12-21,Sheldon>你刚伤害了我的感情
<12-21,Sheldon>you just hurt my feelings.

363
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,510
<12-22,Penny>我刚做什么了
<12-22,Penny>What did I do?

364
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,000
<12-23,Sheldon>我对你敞开心扉分享秘密
<12-23,Sheldon>I opened up and shared something

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,490
<12-23,Sheldon>让我最郁闷不已的秘密
<12-23,Sheldon>deeply upsetting to me,

366
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,620
<12-23,Sheldon>而你却表现得好像不是什么大事
<12-23,Sheldon>and you treated it as if it were nothing.

367
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,550
<12-24,Penny>我是不觉得这是大事
<12-24,Penny>I-I didn't think it was a big deal.

368
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,890
<12-25,Sheldon>但对我来说是  这就是重点
<12-25,Sheldon>It is to me; that's the point.

369
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,680
<12-26,Penny>谢尔顿  你说得对
<12-26,Penny>Sheldon, you are right.

370
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,710
<12-26,Penny>真的很不对不起
<12-26,Penny>I'm really sorry.

371
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,780
<12-26,Penny>我不该那么做
<12-26,Penny>I should've known better.

372
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,170
<12-27,Sheldon>我接受你的道歉
<12-27,Sheldon>Your apology is accepted.

373
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,830
<12-27,Sheldon>谢谢
<12-27,Sheldon>Thank you.

374
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,940
<12-28,Penny>那来抱一个吧
<12-28,Penny>How about a hug?

375
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,020
<12-29,Sheldon>-还是真诚地握个手算了  -抱一个嘛
<12-29,Sheldon>- How about a hearty handshake? - Come on.

376
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,550
<12-31,Sheldon>现在我知道你当时
<12-31,Sheldon>Now I know how you felt getting mauled

377
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,530
<12-31,Sheldon>被性致勃勃大猩猩袭击的感觉了
<12-31,Sheldon>by that sex-crazed gorilla.

378
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,710
<13-1,Bernadette>晚安
<13-1,Bernadette>Good night.

379
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,000
<13-2,Amy>今晚有陌生人请咱们喝酒真是受宠若惊呀
<13-2,Amy>It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.

380
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
<13-3,Bernadette>对呀  感觉真好
<13-3,Bernadette>Yeah, that felt nice.

381
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,630
<13-4,Amy>或许明天我们应该穿上性感点的裤子
<13-4,Amy>Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants

382
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,190
<13-4,Amy>看看会不会有人请咱们吃煎蛋饼
<13-4,Amy>and see if we can score us some free omelets.

383
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,020
<13-5,Bernadette>假设如果我们当时跟他们一起走
<13-5,Bernadette>So, hypothetically, if-if we were to have gone with them,

384
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,910
<13-5,Bernadette>你会选择跟哪个走
<13-5,Bernadette>which one would you have picked?

385
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,340
<13-6,Amy>我觉得我会选
<13-6,Amy>I think I would have gone with

386
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,320
<13-6,Amy>那个发型可笑的矮子
<13-6,Amy>the short one with the goofy haircut.

387
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,830
<13-7,Bernadette>正好  因为我喜欢又高又瘦那个
<13-7,Bernadette>Oh, good, 'cause I liked the tall thin one.

388
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,520
<13-7,Bernadette>他看起来很聪明  有些孤傲
<13-7,Bernadette>He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner,

389
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,440
<13-7,Bernadette>或许缺乏性经验
<13-7,Bernadette>maybe a little sexually inexperienced,

390
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,230
<13-7,Bernadette>可以让我好好给他上一两节课
<13-7,Bernadette>like I'd have to teach him a thing or two.

391
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,070
<13-8,Amy>我那个不是这样
<13-8,Amy>Not my guy.

392
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,480
<13-8,Amy>我发现他盯着我的胸部看
<13-8,Amy>I caught him staring at my rack.

393
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
<13-8,Amy>有人想知道我羊毛衫下
<13-8,Amy>It'd be nice to be with a man

394
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,550
<13-8,Amy>藏着什么的感觉真好
<13-8,Amy>who wants to know what's underneath my cardigan.

395
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,520
<13-8,Amy>对了  是另一件羊毛衫哦
<13-8,Amy>FYI, it's another cardigan.

396
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,550
<13-9,Bernadette>你那个色鬼矮子听起来像霍华德
<13-9,Bernadette>Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.

397
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,640
<13-10,Amy>你那个聪明的处男听起来像谢尔顿
<13-10,Amy>Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.

398
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,820
<13-10,Amy>-晚安  -晚安
<13-10,Amy>- Good night. - Night.

<14-1,Mrs Davis>it's been nice talking to you,

401
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,630
<14-1,Mrs Davis>但我得回家让我保姆下班了
<14-1,Mrs Davis>but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.

402
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,660
<14-2,Raj>当然  我也懂当单亲父母的感受
<14-2,Raj>Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent.

403
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,550
<14-2,Raj>我有一只狗
<14-2,Raj>I have a dog.

<14-3,Mrs Davis>是呀  这两者是"一样"的啊
<14-3,Mrs Davis>Yeah, it's exactly the same thing.

407
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,520
<14-4,Raj>我必须坦白
<14-4,Raj>I, uh, I must confess,

408
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,200
<14-4,Raj>我今晚来这里是抱着失败的心
<14-4,Raj>I came here tonight in a futile attempt

409
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,670
<14-4,Raj>企图勾搭上某个寂寞的博士后
<14-4,Raj>to pick up some lonely postdoc,

410
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,540
<14-4,Raj>但我却意外跟你进行了人类层面的交流
<14-4,Raj>but instead I got to connect with you at a human level.

411
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,220
<14-4,Raj>比我想象的夜晚好多了
<14-4,Raj>That's a much better evening.

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,850
<14-4,Raj>你是个很棒的人

<14-5,Mrs Davis>你是在试图勾搭我吗
<14-5,Mrs Davis>Are you hitting on me?

414
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,380
<14-6,Raj>不  不  那样太扯了
<14-6,Raj>No, no, no, that would be crazy!

<14-6,Raj>如果我是在勾搭你  你会知道
<14-6,Raj>I mean, if I were hitting on you, you'd know it

416
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,230
<14-6,Raj>因为你会觉得不舒服  还会为我感到悲哀
<14-6,Raj>'cause you'd feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.

417
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,730
<14-6,Raj>你人真好
<14-6,Raj>You're sweet.

<14-10,Raj>不止呢
<14-10,Raj>And then some.

422
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,140
<14-10,Raj>我觉得我们有擦出火花
<14-10,Raj>I think we had a moment.

423
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,370
<14-11,Howard>拜托  你们才没有擦出火花
<14-11,Howard>Oh, please, you did not have a moment.

424
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,880
<14-12,Raj>谁死后把火花鉴定王之位传给你了吗
<14-12,Raj>Who died and made you king of moments?

425

<14-13,Howard>好吧  就算你们有擦出火花

429
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,770
<14-16,Raj>我会慢慢勾引她
<14-16,Raj>I will slowly seduce her

430
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,610
<14-16,Raj>直到她无法抗拒  上我的床
<14-16,Raj>until she falls helpless into my bed,

431
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,610
<14-16,Raj>渴求只有我能给她的欢愉
<14-16,Raj>hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.

<15-1,Penny (acting)>that psychotic genetically engineered ape.

435
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,330
<15-2,Leonard (on ship)>我对天发誓  那就是我的女朋友
<15-2,Leonard (on ship)>That is my girlfriend! I swear to God!
