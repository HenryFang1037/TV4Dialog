00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,020
<12-2,Sheldon>大家好
<12-2,Sheldon>Hello.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,010
<1-1,Sheldon>我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
<1-1,Sheldon>I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,550
<1-1,Sheldon>欢迎收看由谢尔顿·库珀出品的《有趣的旗帜》
<1-1,Sheldon>And welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,430
<1-1,Sheldon>最终集  壮丽的旗帜
<1-1,Sheldon>the Final Episode Flagtacular.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,330
<1-1,Sheldon>我知道会有拉炮  还是吓死人家了
<1-1,Sheldon>I knew it was coming. Still scary.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,810
<1-1,Sheldon>我知道你们一定在想"居然最终集了
<1-1,Sheldon>Now, I'm sure you're thinking, "The final episode?

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,660
<1-1,Sheldon>是谁要害你们变成旗帜盲了"
<1-1,Sheldon>who will stand between us and flag ignorance"

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,170
<1-2,Amy>像我就有这个想法
<1-2,Amy>I know I was thinking that.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,100
<1-2,Amy>这是旗帜节目还是读心节目啊
<1-2,Amy>Is this a show on flags or mind reading?

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,860
<1-3,Sheldon>但事实上是因为我无法继续兼顾全职工作
<1-3,Sheldon>But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career,

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,650
<1-3,Sheldon>热门网络节目  以及女朋友了
<1-3,Sheldon>a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,170
<1-4,Amy>他是真的有女朋友  你们这些留言的混球们
<1-4,Amy>And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,930
<1-5,Sheldon>常言道  天下无不散之筵席
<1-5,Sheldon>So as they say, all good things must come to an end.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,130
<1-6,Amy>虽然仅有232集视觉飨宴
<1-6,Amy>After only 232 episodes.

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,410
<1-7,Sheldon>如果某人有次
<1-7,Sheldon>233 if we include the one

16
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,550
<1-7,Sheldon>没忘了按下录制键  那应该是233集
<1-7,Sheldon>somebody forgot to press record on.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,570
<1-8,Amy>说好了不提那事儿
<1-8,Amy>You said you weren't gonna bring that up.

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,870
<1-8,Amy>说好了你会按录制键
<1-8,Amy>And you said you pressed record.

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,030
<1-9,Sheldon>总之  用放松的姿势
<1-9,Sheldon>Anyway, please sit back, relax,

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,500
<1-9,Sheldon>跟着我们一起跑完这最后一圈
<1-9,Sheldon>and join us as we take our final lap...

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,230
<1-9,Sheldon>就像这只赛车旗指示的一样
<1-9,Sheldon>...as indicated by the waving of this racing flag.

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,900
<1-9,Sheldon>白旗在不同系列车赛中有不同意义
<1-9,Sheldon>有些代表场上有慢速车辆  有些则是最后一圈

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,900
<1-9,Sheldon>当然  白旗也代表"举白旗投降"
<1-9,Sheldon>And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender,

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,930
<1-9,Sheldon>刚铎宰相  日本源氏也都使用白旗
<1-9,Sheldon>the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan,

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,600
<1-9,Sheldon>刚铎宰相  《魔戒》中刚铎地区的统治者
<1-9,Sheldon>日本源氏与平家大战时  一家白旗  一家红旗

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,600
<1-9,Sheldon>但想必你们肯定还记得这些
<1-9,Sheldon>but I'm sure you remember that from episode 62,

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,880
<1-9,Sheldon>因为62集"白旗  谁举白旗及缘由"都讲过
<1-9,Sheldon>"White Flags: Who's Wavin' 'Em and Why"

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,110
<1-10,Amy>那集超赞
<1-10,Amy>That was a good one.

29
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,050
<1-11,Sheldon>的确是赞到爆炸
<1-11,Sheldon>It was so good.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,630
<2-1,Raj>我本来以为清理过世教授的
<2-1,Raj>You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor's office

37
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,290
<2-1,Raj>办公室会很无聊
<2-1,Raj>was gonna just be boring,

38
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,490
<2-1,Raj>不过在我发现他的假牙后
<2-1,Raj>but then I found his dentures

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,750
<2-1,Raj>我才意识到是无聊加恶心
<2-1,Raj>and realized it's also gross.

40
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,970
<2-2,Howard>艾伯特教授的家人不想要这些东西吗
<2-2,Howard>Doesn't Professor Abbott's family want any of this stuff?

41
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,280
<2-3,Leonard>我记得他好像没家人
<2-3,Leonard>I don't think he had a family.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,910
<2-4,Raj>-真惨  -是啊
<2-4,Raj>- That's rough. - I know.

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,830
<2-5,Leonard>一生都奉献给了工作
<2-5,Leonard>You can spend your whole life working,

44
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,500
<2-5,Leonard>最后留下的只有盒子里的一些研究资料
<2-5,Leonard>and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box.

45
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,490
<2-6,Howard>不禁让你思索人生
<2-6,Howard>Makes you think.

46
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,230
<2-6,Howard>算了吧
<2-6,Howard>Oh, well.

47
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,950
<2-7,Leonard>我们都得仔细检查过这些东西
<2-7,Leonard>Hey. Hey, we're supposed to look through all this stuff

48
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,710
<2-7,Leonard>以确保不会扔掉什么重要资料
<2-7,Leonard>before we throw it away in case it's important.

49
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,430
<2-8,Howard>看啦  不是太旧就是被拒[反证]的
<2-8,Howard>I-I did. It's all outdated or disproved.

50
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,100
<2-9,Raj>不一定哦  这支旧笔"证明"了重力存在
<2-9,Raj>I don't know. This old pen kind of proves gravity.

51
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,420
<2-9,Raj>翻转过来  小人偶的泳衣就掉下来
<2-9,Raj>When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.

52
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,370
<2-10,Howard>我爸以前也有一支这样的笔
<2-10,Howard>Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that.

53
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,150
<2-10,Howard>我整个六年级都跟它"约会"
<2-10,Howard>I dated it all through sixth grade.

54
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,690
<2-11,Leonard>还是感觉很奇怪
<2-11,Leonard>It still feels weird

55
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,590
<2-11,Leonard>就这样把这些研究成果都扔掉
<2-11,Leonard>just throwing away his work like this.

56
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,740
<2-12,Howard>不用难过
<2-12,Howard>Don't feel bad.

57
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,570
<2-12,Howard>未来某天  也会有人来扔你的研究报告
<2-12,Howard>Someday, someone will be throwing out your work, too.

58
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,120
<2-13,Leonard>那个人就是谢尔顿  而那个某天是昨天
<2-13,Leonard>That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday.

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,760
<2-13,Leonard>你们瞧
<2-13,Leonard>Hey, look at this.

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,110
<2-13,Leonard>"亲爱的罗杰  在你获得首次重大发现时开
<2-13,Leonard>"Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery.

61
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,750
<2-13,Leonard>爱你  妈"
<2-13,Leonard>Love, Mom."

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,180
<2-13,Leonard>瞧瞧这日期
<2-13,Leonard>Wow, look at the date.

63
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,160
<2-13,Leonard>他留了整整50年  却从没有机会开
<2-13,Leonard>He saved this 50 years and never got to open it.

64
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,960
<2-14,Howard>真是让人惋惜
<2-14,Howard>That's intense.

65
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,050
<2-15,Raj>可怜的罗杰·艾伯特
<2-15,Raj>Poor Roger Abbott.

66
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,430
<2-16,Howard>罗杰特听起来像罗杰兔
<2-16,Howard>Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.

68
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,420
<2-17,Raj>罗杰特  罗杰特  罗杰兔
<2-17,Raj>Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Rabbit.

69
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,080
<2-17,Raj>天啊  莱纳德  我知道这对死者不敬
<2-17,Raj>Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he's dead,

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,170
<2-17,Raj>不过你念念看  超好笑啊
<2-17,Raj>but try it. It's fun!

71
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,580
<2-17,Raj>罗杰特  罗杰特  罗杰兔
<2-17,Raj>Roger Abbott, Roger Rabbit...

72
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,970
<3-1,Dan>佩妮
<3-1,Dan>Penny!

73
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,360
<3-1,Dan>我的年度最佳新人
<3-1,Dan>Oh, my rookie of the year.

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,020
<3-2,Penny>丹  我一开始不想雇我
<3-2,Penny>Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me

75
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,980
<3-2,Penny>但现在超爱抱我的老板
<3-2,Penny>and now's a little hug machine.

76
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,550
<3-3,Dan>看看你  新加入不久就业绩第三名
<3-3,Dan>Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.

77
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,390
<3-5,Dan>-过来我那桌坐坐吧  -我马上过去
<3-5,Dan>- Why don't you come over to my table. - Yes. I'll be right there.

78
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,400
<3-6,Penny>伯纳黛特还在停车
<3-6,Penny>Bernadette's just parking the car.

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,090
<3-7,Dan>太好了
<3-7,Dan>Oh, good.

80
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,600
<3-7,Dan>伯纳黛特  人萌音甜
<3-7,Dan>Bernadette. Cute, sweet...

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,180
<3-7,Dan>恶毒凶残的小伯纳黛特
<3-7,Dan>vicious little Bernadette.

82
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,270
<3-8,Penny>别这样嘛  她没那么坏
<3-8,Penny>Come on. She's not that bad.

83
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,040
<3-8,Penny>是吗
<3-8,Penny>Oh, yeah?

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,560
<3-9,Dan>公司野餐的时候  她吼了我跟我孙子
<3-9,Dan>At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,850
<3-9,Dan>因为我们输了二人三腿赛跑
<3-9,Dan>for losing the three-legged race.

86
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,400
<3-9,Dan>我孙子现在还叫她为"毒舌大奶娃"
<3-9,Dan>I mean, he still calls her "That mean kid with the big boobies."

87
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,270
<3-10,Penny>她有时候是有点凶  但我保证
<3-10,Penny>I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear,

88
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,350
<3-10,Penny>等稍微熟了之后   她就是很亲切的一个人了
<3-10,Penny>she is so sweet once you get past all the...

89
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,630
<3-11,Bernadette>你们在聊什么
<3-11,Bernadette>Hey, what are you talking about?

90
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,730
<3-12,Penny>我们在聊有多喜欢跟你共事
<3-12,Penny>We were just talking about how much we love working with you.

91
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,820
<3-12,Penny>对吧
<3-12,Penny>Isn't that right?

92
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,280
<3-12,Penny>丹
<3-12,Penny>Dan?

93
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,090
<4-1,Sheldon>在《有趣的旗帜》的这些岁月里
<4-1,Sheldon>Over the years here at Fun With Flags,

94
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,740
<4-1,Sheldon>我们有机会一同学习  欢笑  惊奇
<4-1,Sheldon>we've had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder...

95
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,330
<4-2,Amy>甚至落过几滴泪
<4-2,Amy>And, yes, even shed a tear or two.

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,120
<4-3,Sheldon>比如国庆节做了两小时特别节目
<4-3,Sheldon>Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,640
<4-3,Sheldon>结果却没被录下来
<4-3,Sheldon>and it doesn't get recorded.

98
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,870
<4-4,Amy>到底要我道歉几次才够
<4-4,Amy>How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

99
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,980
<4-5,Sheldon>先来个四千次吧
<4-5,Sheldon>How about 4,000.

100
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,440
<4-5,Sheldon>向我拼成美国国旗的每一片骨牌道歉
<4-5,Sheldon>One for every domino I set up to make that American flag.

101
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,370
<4-5,Sheldon>请欣赏我们的精彩剪辑
<4-5,Sheldon>Please enjoy these highlights.

102
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,770
<4-6,Sheldon>"澳"哟妈呀  今天是讲哪国的旗呢
<4-6,Sheldon>Crikey! What flag do we have today?

103
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,920
<4-7,Amy>澳大利亚  兄弟[澳洲口音]
<4-7,Amy>Australia, mate!

104
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,870
<4-8,Sheldon>现在到了高速国旗大鉴定的单元
<4-8,Sheldon>And now it's time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.

105
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,040
<4-8,Sheldon>国旗  国旗
<4-8,Sheldon>Flag. Flag.

106
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,520
<4-8,Sheldon>不是国旗  国旗
<4-8,Sheldon>Not a flag. Flag.

107
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,560
<4-9,Kripke>我太厉害了
<4-9,Kripke>I am crushing this.

108
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,420
<4-10,Amy>贝特西·罗斯  你在缝什么呢
<4-10,Amy>Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?

109
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,420
<4-10,Amy>被美国公众广泛认作美国国旗的首位缝制者
<4-10,Amy>但缺乏足够的档案记载以佐证这一观点

110
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,980
<4-11,Sheldon>我也不知道
<4-11,Sheldon>I have no idea.

111
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,510
<4-11,Sheldon>因为我缝出第一面美国旗帜的故事
<4-11,Sheldon>Because the story of me sewing the first American flag

112
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,210
<4-11,Sheldon>是没证据的狗屁
<4-11,Sheldon>is unsupported poppycock.

113
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,940
<4-12,Amy>那到底是谁缝的呢
<4-12,Amy>Then who did sew it, hmm?

114
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,690
<4-13,Sheldon>别问我
<4-13,Sheldon>Don't ask me.

115
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,350
<4-13,Sheldon>我只是个普通的女裁缝  是我的后代
<4-13,Sheldon>I'm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are...

116
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,700
<4-13,Sheldon>想出来坑蒙拐骗
<4-13,Sheldon>out to make a quick buck!

117
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,210
<4-14,Sheldon>赏脸共泳吗
<4-14,Sheldon>Fancy a dip, my dear?

118
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,790
<4-15,Amy>乐意之至
<4-15,Amy>I do.

119
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,390
<4-16,Sheldon>等等  紫色旗子代表了
<4-16,Sheldon>Wait, that purple flag indicates

120
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,380
<4-16,Sheldon>水域有海洋有害生物  比如毒水母
<4-16,Sheldon>that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.

121
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,570
<4-17,Amy>哇  这旗子拯"救生"命啊
<4-17,Amy>Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.

122
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,710
<4-17,Amy>不是
<4-17,Amy>No.

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,790
<4-18,Sheldon>这才是"救生"圈
<4-18,Sheldon>This is.

124
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,500
<4-18,Sheldon>别盯着人家腿了
<4-18,Sheldon>Stop looking at my legs.

125
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,830
<4-7,Amy>不是国旗  国旗
<4-7,Amy>Not a flag. Flag.

126
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,620
<4-8,Sheldon>国旗  不是国旗
<4-8,Sheldon>Flag. Not a flag.

127
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,950
<4-8,Sheldon>是的
<4-8,Sheldon>Flag.

128
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,530
<4-8,Sheldon>靠
<4-8,Sheldon>Crap.

129
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,500
<5-1,Raj>碰到这种让我难受的事
<5-1,Raj>When stuff like this gets me down,

130
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,920
<5-1,Raj>你知道我都怎么做吗
<5-1,Raj>you know what I like to do?

131
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,140
<5-2,Howard>像八岁小女孩一样唱"哈库那马他他"吗
<5-2,Howard>Sing "Hakuna Matata" Like an eight-year-old girl?

132
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,140
<5-2,Howard>《狮子王》电影中的欢乐歌曲
<5-2,Howard>意为"不用担心"或"没有问题"

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,940
<5-3,Raj>错了  自作聪明
<5-3,Raj>Wrong, smarty-pants.

134
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,110
<5-3,Raj>是《乐高大电影》里的"啥事儿都好赞"
<5-3,Raj>It's "Everything Is Awesome" From The Lego Movie.

136
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,200
<5-4,Leonard>看这些笔记本
<5-4,Leonard>Look at these notebooks.

137
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,350
<5-4,Leonard>一页一页全都是数据
<5-4,Leonard>They're full of pages and pages of data.

138
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,230
<5-4,Leonard>明显是他多年的心血
<5-4,Leonard>He clearly spent years on this.

139
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,960
<5-5,Howard>只是一行行无规律的数字  扔了吧
<5-5,Howard>Oh, it's just columns of random numbers. Toss it.

140
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,900
<5-6,Leonard>万一这是他可能的重要突破呢
<5-6,Leonard>Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him?

141
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
<5-6,Leonard>万一这是让能他
<5-6,Leonard>What if... what if this is the thing

142
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,960
<5-6,Leonard>如愿以偿打开那瓶香槟的东西呢
<5-6,Leonard>that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne?

143
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,580
<5-7,Raj>或许他不开  是因为不知道香槟要配什么
<5-7,Raj>Maybe he didn't know what to pair champagne with.

144
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,370
<5-7,Raj>草莓  鱼子酱  生蚝  都是好选择
<5-7,Raj>Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices.

145
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
<5-7,Raj>瞧你那态度
<5-7,Raj>Yeah, that look right there

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
<5-7,Raj>所以大家才会在参加你派对前先吃饱
<5-7,Raj>is why people eat before they come to your parties.

147
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,970
<5-8,Leonard>这些数据绝对是有意义的
<5-8,Leonard>This has to mean something.

148
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,740
<5-9,Howard>我没能看出有什么规律啊
<5-9,Howard>Well, there's no discernible pattern that I can see,

149
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,390
<5-9,Howard>不过输进电脑里验证应该是没什么难度
<5-9,Howard>but it shouldn't be too hard to run the numbers and check.

150
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,740
<5-10,Leonard>或许我们可以用超级计算机试试
<5-10,Leonard>Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.

151
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,560
<5-11,Howard>可以啊  我们试试用不同的物理常数
<5-11,Howard>Sure. We could try multiple regressions

152
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,080
<5-11,Howard>与实验常数进行多元回归分析
<5-11,Howard>with varying physical and experimental constants.

153
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,360
<5-12,Leonard>还可以用模式匹配算法
<5-12,Leonard>Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm

154
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,630
<5-12,Leonard>将它们与知名未解物理问题做对比
<5-12,Leonard>against well-known unsolved physics problems.

155
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,590
<5-13,Howard>甚至有可能是替换式密码
<5-13,Howard>Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher.

156
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,320
<5-13,Howard>我们可以从基本密码分析着手
<5-13,Howard>We could start with basic cryptanalysis.

157
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,090
<5-14,Raj>或者我们可以问以前跟他同一办公室的人
<5-14,Raj>Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,040
<5-15,Howard>还是那样做吧
<5-15,Howard>Oh, let's do that.

159
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,540
<5-16,Leonard>因为你不知道怎么做密码分析  对吧
<5-16,Leonard>Because you don't know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?

160
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,060
<5-17,Howard>我甚至不确定我说的词对不对
<5-17,Howard>I'm not even sure if it's the right word.

161
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,860
<6-1,Penny>丹  你有个孙子
<6-1,Penny>So, Dan, you have a grandson.

162
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,420
<6-1,Penny>-他几岁了  -七岁
<6-1,Penny>- How old is he? - Seven.

163
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,220
<6-3,Bernadette>我记得他  在那次野餐有见过
<6-3,Bernadette>Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic.

164
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,600
<6-3,Bernadette>一直哭个不停  像个娘娘腔似地
<6-3,Bernadette>He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,030
<6-4,Penny>我听说他是被一个小恶霸欺负了
<6-4,Penny>I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.

166
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,880
<6-5,Bernadette>有助人格发展啊
<6-5,Bernadette>Just builds character.

167
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,790
<6-5,Bernadette>就像我爸说的  "没人喜欢爱哭鬼
<6-5,Bernadette>Like my dad said, "Nobody likes a crybaby

168
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,070
<6-5,Bernadette>除了他们自己的妈还有民主党"
<6-5,Bernadette>except their mommies and Democrats."

169
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,280
<6-6,Dan>失陪  我去加酒
<6-6,Dan>I need another drink.

170
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,960
<6-7,Bernadette>他是有啥不满
<6-7,Bernadette>What's his problem?

171
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,040
<6-8,Penny>不知道  可能他不喜欢听到
<6-8,Penny>I don't know. Maybe he didn't like the fact

172
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,920
<6-8,Penny>自己的孙子被你叫娘娘腔吧
<6-8,Penny>that you called his grandson a wuss.

173
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,940
<6-9,Bernadette>可现在不是不让叫别人"娘炮"吗
<6-9,Bernadette>Well, I didn't think you were supposed to say "sissy" anymore.

174
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,740
<6-10,Penny>我知道你这个人很好
<6-10,Penny>Okay, look, I know what a good person you are,

175
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,970
<6-10,Penny>可有时别人会觉得你表现得有点毒舌
<6-10,Penny>but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.

176
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,100
<6-10,Penny>什么
<6-10,Penny>What?

177
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,010
<6-11,Bernadette>我是我这辈子认识最甜的人了
<6-11,Bernadette>I'm, like, the sweetest person I know.

178
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,470
<6-11,Bernadette>甜得像树里做小饼干的童话人物
<6-11,Bernadette>Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.

179
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,270
<6-12,Penny>可是有些时候
<6-12,Penny>Yes, but once in a while,

180
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,200
<6-12,Penny>有人会觉得你有点刻薄
<6-12,Penny>people think you're a little mean.

181
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,350
<6-12,Penny>是吗
<6-12,Penny>Oh, yeah?

182
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,290
<6-13,Bernadette>你是那些人中的一员吗
<6-13,Bernadette>You one of those people?

183
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,400
<6-14,Penny>不  不是不是
<6-14,Penny>No. No, no, no.

184
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,380
<6-14,Penny>我也觉得你是做饼干那种
<6-14,Penny>I-I think the cookie thing.

185
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,440
<7-1,Amy>开始
<7-1,Amy>Action.

<7-8,Sheldon>既然你来了
<7-8,Sheldon>Well, since you're here,

198
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,290
<7-8,Sheldon>我想问你对某件事的看法
<7-8,Sheldon>I'd like to get your opinion on something.

199
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,340
<7-8,Sheldon>为了向黑人历史月致意
<7-8,Sheldon>In honor of Black History Month,

201
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,580
<7-8,Sheldon>我扮成了乔治·华盛顿·卡弗
<7-8,Sheldon>I portrayed George Washington Carver

202
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,340
<7-8,Sheldon>是美国教育家  农业化学家  植物学家
<7-8,Sheldon>对美国有十分大贡献的一名黑人

203
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,080
<7-8,Sheldon>我对他的致敬被我室友说"超有种族歧视"
<7-8,Sheldon>in a loving tribute that my roommate called "wildly racist"

204
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,250
<7-8,Sheldon>你觉得呢
<7-8,Sheldon>What do you think?

205
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,850
<7-8,Sheldon>你好  我的名字叫乔治
<7-8,Sheldon>Hi. My name is George.

206
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,080
<7-9,LeVar>我去  不是吧
<7-9,LeVar>Oh, hell, no!

207
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,980
<7-10,Sheldon>听到了吗  莱纳德
<7-10,Sheldon>You heard him, Leonard.

208
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,900
<7-10,Sheldon>"不是"吧  我没有种族歧视
<7-10,Sheldon>No, it's not racist.

209
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,800
<8-1,Howard>咱们确定是这里吗
<8-1,Howard>Are we sure this is the place?

210
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,820
<8-2,Raj>看门的说就是这栋楼
<8-2,Raj>The doorman said this is the right building.

211
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,300
<8-3,Leonard>看到人来就赶紧提裤子的
<8-3,Leonard>I think if you're pulling up your pants,

212
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,240
<8-3,Leonard>不会是看门的  是野战的
<8-3,Leonard>you're not a doorman.

213
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,610
<8-4,Man (off)>谁啊
<8-4,Man (off)>Who is it?

214
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,820
<8-5,Leonard>我想找夏普教授
<8-5,Leonard>Uh, I'm looking for a Professor Sharpe?

215
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,030
<8-6,Prof Sharpe>等等
<8-6,Prof Sharpe>Hold on.

216
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,190
<8-6,Prof Sharpe>-有事吗  -您好  我们是大学的人
<8-6,Prof Sharpe>- Can I help you? - Hi. We're from the university.

217
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,570
<8-7,Leonard>我们想从您这打听艾伯特教授的信息
<8-7,Leonard>We're trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.

218
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,720
<8-8,Howard>我们在清理他的办公室时
<8-8,Howard>We were cleaning out his office

219
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,940
<8-8,Howard>发现了一些写满数字的本子
<8-8,Howard>and found these books full of numbers.

220
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,290
<8-9,Leonard>您知道这是什么吗
<8-9,Leonard>Any chance you know what it is?

221
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,190
<8-10,Prof Sharpe>知道  他总是在搞这玩意
<8-10,Prof Sharpe>Yes, he was always working on this.

222
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,300
<8-11,Raj>我猜可能是某种星际坐标系
<8-11,Raj>I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system,

223
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,360
<8-11,Raj>或许是哈勃定律的升级版
<8-11,Raj>maybe an updated version of Hubble's law.

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,820
<8-11,Raj>"90"这个数字总是重复出现
<8-11,Raj>I keep seeing the number 90 repeating.

226
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,780
<8-11,Raj>那可能是某个遥远星系的摄动角度
<8-11,Raj>That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.

227
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,240
<8-12,Prof Sharpe>其实是一份酸奶的卡路里数
<8-12,Prof Sharpe>It's the number of calories in a yogurt.

228
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,060
<8-12,Prof Sharpe>这是他的饮食日记
<8-12,Prof Sharpe>That's his food diary.

229
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,100
<8-13,Leonard>真的假的
<8-13,Leonard>Really?

230
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,710
<8-14,Prof Sharpe>真的  他吃什么都要记下来
<8-14,Prof Sharpe>Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate.

231
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,000
<8-14,Prof Sharpe>他坚信限制卡路里摄入量
<8-14,Prof Sharpe>He was convinced that calorie restriction

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,570
<8-14,Prof Sharpe>是长命百岁的关键
<8-14,Prof Sharpe>was the key to living forever.

233
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,240
<8-15,Raj>那管用吗
<8-15,Raj>Does it work?

234
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,750
<8-16,Howard>你闹呢
<8-16,Howard>Seriously?

235
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,810
<8-17,Raj>他可能是死于车祸啊  你又不知道
<8-17,Raj>Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don't know.

236
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,940
<8-18,Prof Sharpe>抱歉  真相不是那么有趣
<8-18,Prof Sharpe>Sorry it's not more interesting.

237
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,540
<8-18,Prof Sharpe>往好的方面想  你们不必听
<8-18,Prof Sharpe>On the bright side, you didn't have to listen

238
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,220
<8-18,Prof Sharpe>他35年来肚子饿得咕噜叫的声音
<8-18,Prof Sharpe>to his stomach growl for 35 years.

239
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,710
<8-19,Leonard>那艾伯特教授这辈子研究的东西
<8-19,Leonard>So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on

240
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,100
<8-19,Leonard>难道没有半点算得上是成就的东西吗
<8-19,Leonard>during his life that came close to an accomplishment?

241
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,370
<8-20,Prof Sharpe>老实说  他的研究一无所成
<8-20,Prof Sharpe>To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.

242
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,280
<8-21,Raj>你是他的同事
<8-21,Raj>Oh. You were his colleague.

243
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,440
<8-21,Raj>你的研究结果如何
<8-21,Raj>How did your research turn out?

244
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,190
<8-21,Raj>很棒
<8-21,Raj>Great.

245
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,740
<8-21,Raj>得诺贝尔奖的人  都住这种"豪宅"
<8-21,Raj>Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.

246
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,940
<8-22,Raj>你可以是一个很简朴的人啊
<8-22,Raj>Well, you could be very frugal.

247
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,760
<8-22,Raj>我真是受够了每个人都在说反话了
<8-22,Raj>I'm getting a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.

248
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,810
<9-1,Bernadette>我不是恶霸
<9-1,Bernadette>I'm not a bully.

249
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,660
<9-1,Bernadette>或许我是表现得有那么一点强势
<9-1,Bernadette>I mean, maybe I come off a little strong,

250
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,670
<9-1,Bernadette>但那只是因为我父亲从小教育我要强硬
<9-1,Bernadette>but that's only because my dad raised me to be tough

251
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,340
<9-1,Bernadette>不要随便受人欺负
<9-1,Bernadette>and not to take crap from anybody.

252
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,930
<9-2,Penny>那当然可以啊
<9-2,Penny>No. That's fine,

253
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,510
<9-2,Penny>但强硬跟告诉你的朋友
<9-2,Penny>but there's a difference between being tough

254
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,250
<9-2,Penny>她的新裤子像一块松垮的尿布
<9-2,Penny>and telling your friend her new pants

255
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,560
<9-2,Penny>这两者还是有区别的
<9-2,Penny>look like a saggy diaper.

256
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,350
<9-3,Bernadette>我的确那么说了  是吧
<9-3,Bernadette>I did say that, didn't I?

257
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,220
<9-4,Penny>是的  你说了
<9-4,Penny>Yeah, you did.

258
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,930
<9-4,Penny>我当时超级难为情  我只好把裤子退了
<9-4,Penny>I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.

259
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,820
<9-5,Bernadette>退到哪儿  婴儿用品店吗
<9-5,Bernadette>Where? To Babies R Us?

260
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,740
<9-6,Penny>你又来了
<9-6,Penny>You're doing it again!

261
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,370
<9-7,Bernadette>对不起  我们可以走了吗
<9-7,Bernadette>Okay, sorry. Can we just go?

262
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,760
<9-7,Bernadette>我感觉大家都讨厌我
<9-7,Bernadette>I feel like everybody hates me.

263
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,300
<9-8,Penny>别这样  他们不讨厌你  好吗
<9-8,Penny>Oh, come on, they don't hate you, all right?

264
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,140
<9-8,Penny>他们只是有点怕你而已
<9-8,Penny>They're just a little intimidated.

265
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,230
<9-8,Penny>你只需让大家看到
<9-8,Penny>All you need to do is show everyone

266
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,780
<9-8,Penny>你其实非常亲切
<9-8,Penny>how sweet you really are.

267
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,530
<9-9,Bernadette>-我还是走吧  -不  坐下
<9-9,Bernadette>- I think I'd rather go. - No, come on.

268
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,830
<9-10,Penny>你哪儿也不许去  知道吗
<9-10,Penny>You are not going anywhere, all right?

269
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,210
<9-10,Penny>我在这陪着你  我们一起来解决这问题
<9-10,Penny>I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.

270
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:13,940
<9-11,Bernadette>谢谢
<9-11,Bernadette>Thank you.

271
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,060
<9-12,Penny>虽然你今天的裙子很难看
<9-12,Penny>Even though your dress is ugly.

272
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,010
<9-13,Sheldon>我的小旗友们
<9-13,Sheldon>Well, my little Flag-keteers,

273
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,930
<9-13,Sheldon>最后一集《有趣的旗帜》就要结束了
<9-13,Sheldon>it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end.

274
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,850
<9-13,Sheldon>如果可以
<9-13,Sheldon>If I could,

275
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,630
<9-13,Sheldon>你们每个人都是我升上去后
<9-13,Sheldon>I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole

276
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,520
<9-13,Sheldon>原俗语直翻为"升到旗杆上  看看有没有人会敬礼"
<9-13,Sheldon>意思是试试水  看看反应的意思

277
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,520
<9-13,Sheldon>愿意敬礼的旗帜
<9-13,Sheldon>and salute you.

278
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,140
<9-13,Sheldon>如果你掉到地面  我会烧掉你
<9-13,Sheldon>And if you touched the ground, burn you.

279
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,140
<9-13,Sheldon>根据规定  美国国旗降旗时  不能触碰地面
<9-13,Sheldon>如果国旗被弄脏或要退役  得庄重处理  通常烧毁

280
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,440
<9-13,Sheldon>我想花一点时间
<9-13,Sheldon>I'd like to take a moment

281
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,010
<9-13,Sheldon>亲自谢谢艾米·费拉·福勒博士
<9-13,Sheldon>to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

282
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,970
<9-13,Sheldon>你们或许知道  也或许不知道
<9-13,Sheldon>who you may or may not know

283
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,140
<9-13,Sheldon>她是第一位搭档主持关于旗帜
<9-13,Sheldon>is the first woman to co-host a flag

284
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,930
<9-13,Sheldon>或横幅相关的网络寓教于乐节目的女性
<9-13,Sheldon>or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.

285
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,630
<9-14,Amy>听见了吗  玻璃天花板
<9-14,Amy>Take that, glass ceiling.

287
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,390
<9-15,Sheldon>请容许我认真地说几句
<9-15,Sheldon>And if I may get serious for a moment,

288
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,220
<9-15,Sheldon>主持这档节目
<9-15,Sheldon>hosting this show has been...

289
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,030
<9-15,Sheldon>是一段疯狂的旅程
<9-15,Sheldon>one crazy ride.

290
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,560
<9-15,Sheldon>一路走来的高兴与失落
<9-15,Sheldon>With all its ups and downs,

291
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,400
<9-15,Sheldon>是我无论如何都不想放弃的
<9-15,Sheldon>I wouldn't give it up for the world.

292
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,710
<9-15,Sheldon>除了现在  我要放弃这节目了
<9-15,Sheldon>Except for now, when I'm giving it up.

293
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,620
<9-15,Sheldon>在节目正式停播前  我想...
<9-15,Sheldon>Before I sign off, I'd, uh...

294
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,920
<9-15,Sheldon>我想跟大家分享白旗的最后一个用处
<9-15,Sheldon>I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag.

295
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,460
<9-15,Sheldon>像这种时候  可以拿来擦眼泪
<9-15,Sheldon>It's good for times like this.

296
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,880
<9-15,Sheldon>晚安
<9-15,Sheldon>Good night.

297
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,040
<9-16,Amy>停
<9-16,Amy>Cut.

298
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,310
<9-16,Amy>谢尔顿
<9-16,Amy>Sheldon...

299
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,420
<9-16,Amy>刚才那段话太感人了
<9-16,Amy>that was beautiful.

300
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,540
<9-17,Sheldon>如果你没有按下录制...
<9-17,Sheldon>If you didn't press record...

301
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,860
<9-18,Amy>老娘按了
<9-18,Amy>I pressed it!

302
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,160
<10-1,Leonard>结束了
<10-1,Leonard>Well, that's it.

303
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,950
<10-1,Leonard>罗杰·艾伯特的东西清理完毕
<10-1,Leonard>That's the end of Roger Abbott.

304
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,310
<10-2,Raj>我们仍不知道是谁陷害了他
<10-2,Raj>And we still don't know who framed him.

306
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,450
<10-3,Leonard>我一直在思考  一个人的一生
<10-3,Leonard>I still keep thinking about how an entire life

307
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,000
<10-3,Leonard>怎么能一无所成呢
<10-3,Leonard>can seemingly amount to nothing.

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,990
<10-4,Howard>事实就是这么悲哀
<10-4,Howard>I guess the sad truth is,

309
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,150
<10-4,Howard>不是所有人都能功成名就
<10-4,Howard>not everyone will accomplish something great.

310
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,970
<10-4,Howard>我们中有些人注定要在
<10-4,Howard>Some of us may just have to find meaning

311
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,340
<10-4,Howard>日常生活的点滴中寻找生命的意义
<10-4,Howard>in the little moments that make up life.

312
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,150
<10-5,Leonard>这个看待的方法很不错
<10-5,Leonard>That's a nice way of looking at it.

313
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,640
<10-6,Howard>对你而言是  我可不是
<10-6,Howard>Yeah for you, not for me.

314
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,920
<10-6,Howard>哥上过太空呢  此生足矣
<10-6,Howard>I went to space. I'm covered.

315
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,030
<10-6,Howard>不如这样
<10-6,Howard>You know what?

316
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,090
<10-7,Leonard>这瓶香槟本来就是要庆祝成就的
<10-7,Leonard>This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement.

317
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,460
<10-7,Leonard>我们做个约定
<10-7,Leonard>Let's make a pact.

318
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,780
<10-7,Leonard>当我们中有人获得人生中第一次重大突破时
<10-7,Leonard>When one of us gets their first big breakthrough,

319
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,570
<10-7,Leonard>我们就打开这瓶香槟庆祝
<10-7,Leonard>we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne

320
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,900
<10-7,Leonard>并向罗杰·艾伯特致敬
<10-7,Leonard>and toasting Professor Abbott.

321
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,630
<10-8,Howard>我喜欢这主意
<10-8,Howard>I love that.

322
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,270
<10-9,Raj>我也是
<10-9,Raj>Yeah, me, too.

323
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,710
<10-10,Leonard>当然还包括
<10-10,Leonard>Then, of course,

324
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,540
<10-10,Leonard>向谢尔顿炫耀我们的成果
<10-10,Leonard>rubbing our success in Sheldon's face.

325
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,200
<10-11,Raj>-这是最精彩的部分  -没错
<10-11,Raj>- Oh, well, that's the best part. - Oh, yeah.

326
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,940
<11-1,Bernadette>丹  我能和你聊聊吗
<11-1,Bernadette>Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?

327
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,760
<11-2,Dan>好的  说吧
<11-2,Dan>Sure, go ahead.

328
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,220
<11-3,Bernadette>我只是想告诉你
<11-3,Bernadette>Just want you to know I didn't mean

329
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,720
<11-3,Bernadette>我不是故意侮辱你的孙子
<11-3,Bernadette>to be rude about your grandson.

330
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,300
<11-4,Dan>没关系
<11-4,Dan>No, it's okay.

331
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,960
<11-4,Dan>不  有关系
<11-4,Dan>No, it's not.

332
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,050
<11-5,Bernadette>佩妮告诉我  大家都怕我
<11-5,Bernadette>Penny told me that everyone's scared of me.

333
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,730
<11-6,Dan>怎么会  怎么会
<11-6,Dan>What? What?

334
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,080
<11-6,Dan>她为什么那么说
<11-6,Dan>Why would she say that?

335
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,290
<11-6,Dan>-你知道她是酒鬼  会乱说话吧  -少来
<11-6,Dan>- You know she drinks, right? - What?

336
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,790
<11-8,Bernadette>不  她说得对  我要让你知道
<11-8,Bernadette>No, she's right, and I just want you to know

337
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,950
<11-8,Bernadette>从现在起  我会多体会大家心情
<11-8,Bernadette>that from now on, I'm gonna be much more sensitive.

338
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,410
<11-8,Bernadette>我不想让大家在我面前如履薄冰
<11-8,Bernadette>I don't want anyone walking on eggshells around me.

339
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,550
<11-9,Dan>那好吧  有件事
<11-9,Dan>Oh, well, okay, then, uh,

340
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,650
<11-9,Dan>我一直想告诉你
<11-9,Dan>one thing I've been meaning to tell you

341
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,620
<11-9,Dan>公司不再给我们提供免费的咖啡了
<11-9,Dan>is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.

342
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,490
<11-10,Bernadette>没问题  什么时候开始
<11-10,Bernadette>No problem. When does that start?

343
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,080
<11-11,Dan>五个月前
<11-11,Dan>Five months ago.

344
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,930
<11-13,Dan>-什么  -没错
<11-13,Dan>- What?! - Yeah.

345
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,560
<11-14,Bernadette>那我的咖啡一直都是谁买的
<11-14,Bernadette>Who's been paying for my coffee?

346
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,610
<11-15,Dan>我们大伙儿
<11-15,Dan>All of us.

347
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,150
<11-16,Penny>买咖啡的钱来自你一骂人
<11-16,Penny>Yeah. It comes from the swear jar

348
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,510
<11-16,Penny>我们就投钱进去的那个脏话罐
<11-16,Penny>we put money in when you curse.

349
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,140
<11-17,Bernadette>还有什么事是我不知道的
<11-17,Bernadette>What else don't I know about?

350
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,610
<11-18,Penny>-你的私人卫生间  -怎么了
<11-18,Penny>- Uh, well, you know your private bathroom? - Yeah?

351
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,880
<11-20,Penny>那应该是给整层楼的人使用的
<11-20,Penny>That was supposed to be for the whole floor.

352
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,000
<11-21,Bernadette>-你开什么玩笑  -那个无所谓
<11-21,Bernadette>- You're kidding. - No, no. It's okay.

353
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,120
<11-22,Dan>其实只对轮椅妹凯西有影响
<11-22,Dan>It only really affected wheelchair Kathy,

354
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,560
<11-22,Dan>现在她已经回医院了
<11-22,Dan>and she's back in the hospital now,

355
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
<11-22,Dan>所以没什么问题了
<11-22,Dan>so it all worked out.

356
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,280
<11-23,Bernadette>我感觉好难过哦
<11-23,Bernadette>I feel so bad.

357
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,410
<11-24,Penny>那你就不应该给人家取名"轮椅妹凯西"啊
<11-24,Penny>Well, then, maybe you shouldn't have named her "Wheelchair Kathy."

358
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,720
<11-25,Bernadette>我的天啊
<11-25,Bernadette>Oh, my God!

359
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,960
<11-25,Bernadette>我以为大家都喜欢我  其实我只是个怪兽
<11-25,Bernadette>I thought everybody liked me, but I'm just a monster.

360
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,910
<11-26,Dan>但很可爱呀  就像《怪兽公司》里的独眼怪
<11-26,Dan>But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.

361
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,580
<11-27,Bernadette>不  我最坏了
<11-27,Bernadette>No, I'm the worst.

362
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,410
<11-27,Bernadette>我是个坏人
<11-27,Bernadette>I'm a terrible person.

363
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,880
<11-28,Dan>乖  别哭  没关系啦
<11-28,Dan>Come on, don't cry. It's okay.

364
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,110
<11-29,Bernadette>有关系
<11-29,Bernadette>It's not okay.

365
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,780
<11-29,Bernadette>我哪还有脸留在这工作呀
<11-29,Bernadette>How can I even work here anymore? Oh.

366
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,420
<11-30,Penny>-这家公司需要你  -真没事
<11-30,Penny>- Because this company needs you. - It's fine.

367
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,150
<11-31,Dan>我们不介意给你买咖啡
<11-31,Dan>We don't mind paying for the coffee.

368
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,550
<11-32,Bernadette>我不能让你们这么做
<11-32,Bernadette>I can't let you do that.

369
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,190
<11-33,Dan>或许我们可以给你
<11-33,Dan>Maybe we could get you

370
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,670
<11-33,Dan>买一台咖啡机放在你办公室里
<11-33,Dan>an espresso machine for your office.

371
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,390
<11-34,Bernadette>-这样也行吧  -好的
<11-34,Bernadette>- I guess that would be all right. - All right.

372
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,620
<11-35,Penny>瞧  你不刻薄也能得到你想要的东西
<11-35,Penny>See? You don't have to be mean to get what you want.

373
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,310
<11-34,Bernadette>此话有理
<11-34,Bernadette>You're right.

374
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,740
<11-36,Bernadette>那我的私人卫生间现在怎么处理呢
<11-36,Bernadette>Now where did we land on my bathroom?

375
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,390
<12-1,Leonard>好啊
<12-1,Leonard>Hi.

376
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,520
<12-2,Sheldon>回来啦
<12-2,Sheldon>Hello.

377
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,210
<12-3,Leonard>这么晚还不睡吗
<12-3,Leonard>How come you're up so late?

378
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,610
<12-4,Sheldon>我上传《有趣的旗帜》最终集好几个小时了
<12-4,Sheldon>I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago,

379
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,140
<12-4,Sheldon>没有任何人在乎到愿意留个言
<12-4,Sheldon>and not a single person cared enough to comment.

380
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,550
<12-4,Sheldon>一切努力都是徒然
<12-4,Sheldon>All that effort for nothing.

381
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,130
<12-5,Leonard>我明白你的感受
<12-5,Leonard>I know how you feel.

382
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,360
<12-5,Leonard>我今天一天把一个男人一生事业扔进垃圾桶
<12-5,Leonard>I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career,

383
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,300
<12-5,Leonard>唯一留下的是一瓶陈年香槟
<12-5,Leonard>and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne

384
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,660
<12-5,Leonard>和拉杰自以为没人发现
<12-5,Leonard>and a naked lady pen that Raj took

385
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,690
<12-5,Leonard>就私吞了的一根裸女笔
<12-5,Leonard>when he thought no one was looking.

386
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,620
<12-6,Sheldon>这根本是两码事
<12-6,Sheldon>It's not the same thing.

387
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,040
<12-6,Sheldon>你完全不明白我的感受
<12-6,Sheldon>I don't think you know how I feel at all.

388
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,070
<12-7,Leonard>是难过吗
<12-7,Leonard>Sad?

389
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,900
<12-8,Sheldon>看来你真的懂我
<12-8,Sheldon>You do get me.

390
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,340
<12-8,Sheldon>有人留言了
<12-8,Sheldon>Someone left a comment.

391
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,620
<12-9,Leonard>他们说什么
<12-9,Leonard>Yeah. What did they say?

392
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,580
<12-10,Sheldon>"你的节目结束了真可惜
<12-10,Sheldon>"Too bad your show is done.

393

<12-10,Sheldon>我还挺喜欢的"
<12-10,Sheldon>I kind of liked it."

394
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,140
<12-10,Sheldon>莱纳德  你听到了吗
<12-10,Sheldon>Leonard, did you hear that?

395
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,870
<12-10,Sheldon>网友们难过得要死
<12-10,Sheldon>Oh, the people are heartbroken!

396
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,720
<12-10,Sheldon>这世界上不能没有这节目
<12-10,Sheldon>I can't take this away from the world!

<12-12,Sheldon>我们来庆祝吧
<12-12,Sheldon>Let's celebrate!

400
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,040
<12-13,Leonard>谢尔顿  那不是给你的
<12-13,Leonard>Sheldon, that wasn't for you!

401
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,550
<12-14,Sheldon>我也没打算喝啊
<12-14,Sheldon>Oh, no, I'm not going to drink it.

402
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,890
<12-14,Sheldon>我只想听开瓶那砰的一声
<12-14,Sheldon>I just wanted to hear the pop.

403
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,600
<12-14,Sheldon>我知道会砰的一声  还是吓死人家了
<12-14,Sheldon>Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.

404
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,640
<13-1,Sheldon>莱瓦尔·伯顿
<13-1,Sheldon>LeVar Burton?

407
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,230
<13-2,LeVar>你来干嘛
<13-2,LeVar>What are you doing here?

408
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,040
<13-3,Sheldon>你不让我打电话给你
<13-3,Sheldon>You told me not to call,

409
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,220
<13-3,Sheldon>我不知道该怎么告诉你这个好消息
<13-3,Sheldon>and I didn't know how else to give you the good news.

410
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,790
<13-3,Sheldon>《有趣的旗帜》回归了
<13-3,Sheldon>Fun with Flags is back,

411
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,790

<13-3,Sheldon>and you can be in the next episode.

412
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,110
<13-4,LeVar>威尔·惠顿让我弄个大闸门
<13-4,LeVar>Wil Wheaton said, get a gate.

413
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,000
<13-4,LeVar>-我当初真该听他的话  -你真是...
<13-4,LeVar>- I don't know why I didn't get a gate. - You...

414
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,270
<13-5,Sheldon>至少你听我说完前提
<13-5,Sheldon>At least listen to the premise.

415
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,240
<13-5,Sheldon>既然你在德国出生
<13-5,Sheldon>Since you were born in Germany,

416
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,020
<13-5,Sheldon>我们可以聊聊德国国旗
<13-5,Sheldon>I thought we could talk about German flags.
