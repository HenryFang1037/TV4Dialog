169
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,190
<7-6,Sheldon>鉴于你最近向佩妮求婚了
<7-6,Sheldon>is it awkward being here with Penny given that

170
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,270
<7-6,Sheldon>跟她一起来是不是很尴尬
<7-6,Sheldon>you recently proposed to her?

176
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,980
<7-11,Penny>那不算正式的求婚
<7-11,Penny>It wasn't a real proposal.

177
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,550
<7-12,Bernadette>为什么不算正式求婚
<7-12,Bernadette>Why wasn't it a real proposal?

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,010
<11-10,Sheldon>因为哪天你可能会让我帮忙搬家
<11-10,Sheldon>because someday you might ask me to help you move...

288
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,570
<11-11,Leonard>...或帮你去杀人
<11-11,Leonard>...or to kill a man.

289
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,990
<11-11,Leonard>想杀人也不会找你帮吧
<11-11,Leonard>I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.

290
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,430
<11-12,Sheldon>万一他没得选了呢
<11-12,Sheldon>Well, what if it's his only way out?

291
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,430
<11-12,Sheldon>我不能冒这个险
<11-12,Sheldon>I can't risk it.

292
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,850
<11-12,Sheldon>这里是12块
<11-12,Sheldon>Here is $12.

293
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,070
<11-12,Sheldon>现在不拖不欠了
<11-12,Sheldon>Now, we're even.

294
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,790
<11-12,Sheldon>慢着
<11-12,Sheldon>Wait...

295
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,910
<11-12,Sheldon>我还有送卡片  退我2块钱
<11-12,Sheldon>I bought a card. Give me two dollars.

296
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,100
<11-12,Sheldon>所以我说嘛  我最讨厌送礼了
<11-12,Sheldon>And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.

297
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,800
<12-1,Amy>谁呀
<12-1,Amy>Who is it?

298
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,250
<12-2,Howard>新郎
<12-2,Howard>It's the groom.

299
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,620
<12-3,Amy>你不能进来  婚前见新娘会倒霉的
<12-3,Amy>You can't come in. Bad luck to see the bride.

300
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,240
<12-4,Howard>好吧
<12-4,Howard>Okay, uh, fine.

301
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,660
<12-4,Howard>妮妮  我得去接我妈
<12-4,Howard>Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother!

302
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,280
<12-4,Howard>马上就回来
<12-4,Howard>I'll be right back!

303
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,560
<12-5,Bernadette (off)>她为什么不能自己开车过来
<12-5,Bernadette (off)>Why can't she drive herself?!

304
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,440
<12-6,Howard>她不想坐皱她的裙子
<12-6,Howard>She doesn't want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it

305
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,630
<12-6,Howard>得让她平躺在小面包车后座才能载过来
<12-6,Howard>so I'm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbor's van!

306
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,230
<12-7,Bernadette (off)>好吧  快去快回
<12-7,Bernadette (off)>All right, just hurry!

<12-8,Howard>"马"上见哦  准新娘
<12-8,Howard>lovely bride-to-be.

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,060
<12-8,Howard>我真得好好注意下了
<12-8,Howard>I really got to watch that.

310
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,310
<13-1,Leonard>快点  拉杰  可以开始了
<13-1,Leonard>Come on, Raj, we're ready to start.

<13-2,Raj>What, we're ready,

312
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,100
<13-2,Raj>得我说了才算

<13-2,Raj>好了  现在可以开始了
<13-2,Raj>Okay, now we're ready.

314
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,150
<13-3,Howard>妈  不坐过来怎么看得到啊
<13-3,Howard>Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?!

315
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,940
<13-4,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>坐这儿就挺好
<13-4,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I'm fine where I am!

316
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,180
<13-4,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我可不想从屋顶上摔下去
<13-4,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I don't want to fall off the roof!

317
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,880
<13-5,Howard>在你摔下去前  屋顶早被你压穿了
<13-5,Howard>You'll fall through the roof before you fall off it.

318
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,580
<13-6,Raj>佩妮
<13-6,Raj>Penny.

319
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,700
<13-7,Mr Rostenkowski>你的新婆婆是个狠角色啊
<13-7,Mr Rostenkowski>Your new mother-in-law's a piece of work.

320
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,120
<13-8,Bernadette>老爸  稍后再谈
<13-8,Bernadette>Not now, Dad.

321
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,020
<13-9,Mr Rostenkowski>她的胡子比我的还"雄壮威武"
<13-9,Mr Rostenkowski>She's got a bigger mustache than me.

322
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,650
<13-10,Bernadette>上吧  少年
<13-10,Bernadette>Here you go.

323
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,140
<13-10,Bernadette>什么"上吧  少年"  我又不是橄榄球
<13-10,Bernadette>"Here you go"? What am I, a football?

324
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,170
<13-11,Mr Rostenkowski>他这废柴要真能接到橄榄球就好了
<13-11,Mr Rostenkowski>Like that guy could catch a football.

325
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,740
<13-12,Raj>霍华德  伯纳黛特
<13-12,Raj>Howard and Bernadette,

326
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,540
<13-12,Raj>今天我们作为你们的朋友兼牧师
<13-12,Raj>the five of us stand before you as your friends

327
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,730
<13-12,Raj>站在你们的面前
<13-12,Raj>and newly ordained ministers.

328
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,400
<13-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>大声点
<13-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Louder!

329
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,300
<13-14,Bernadette>他们都有牧师资格  要一起给我们证婚
<13-14,Bernadette>They all got ordained, they're all marrying us,

330
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,270
<13-14,Bernadette>场面超有爱
<13-14,Bernadette>it's adorable!

331
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,760
<13-14,Bernadette>欲知详情  滚过来听
<13-14,Bernadette>If you want to hear it, come closer!

332
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,420
<13-15,Raj>两位  当我看到你们
<13-15,Raj>Guys, when I look at the two of you

333
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,290
<13-15,Raj>即将开始共度的人生旅程时  我心...
<13-15,Raj>starting your lives together, it fills... my heart...

334
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,240
<13-15,Raj>我心充满...
<13-15,Raj>It fills my... heart...

335
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,570
<13-15,Raj>我需要点时间平复一下
<13-15,Raj>Okay, I'm going to need a minute.

336
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,510
<13-15,Raj>还是我来致辞吧
<13-15,Raj>Okay, I'll, I'll go.

337
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,000
<13-16,Penny>霍华德与伯纳黛特  我知道
<13-16,Penny>Howard and Bernadette, I know you two

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,760
<13-16,Penny>这与你们计划的美妙婚宴大相径庭
<13-16,Penny>planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding,

339
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,820
<13-16,Penny>但只要彼此相爱
<13-16,Penny>but when you're in love,

340
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,680
<13-16,Penny>人间处处能成婚  形式不过锦上添花
<13-16,Penny>it doesn't matter where or how these things happen.

341
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,350
<13-16,Penny>因为拥有对方  便拥有全世界
<13-16,Penny>It just matters that you have each other.

342
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,360
<13-17,Leonard>有意见吗
<13-17,Leonard>Problem?

343
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,300
<13-19,Leonard>没有
<13-19,Leonard>No.

344
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,450
<13-20,Sheldon>我想牧师霍夫斯塔特是在讽刺
<13-20,Sheldon>I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection

345
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,650
<13-20,Sheldon>你对爱情的看法以及
<13-20,Sheldon>between your statement about love and your rejection

346
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,680
<13-20,Sheldon>在你房里求婚被拒的事
<13-20,Sheldon>of his proposal in the bedroom.

347
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,120
<13-21,Penny>-少幼稚了你  -话又不是我说的
<13-21,Penny>- Oh, grow up. - Hey, I didn't say it.

348
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,080
<13-23,Amy>够了  你们两个都收声
<13-23,Amy>All right, that's enough from the both of you.

349
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,910
<13-24,Penny>他先挑事的
<13-24,Penny>Well, he started it!

350
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,140
<13-25,Amy>那我息事可以了吧
<13-25,Amy>Well, I'm ending it!

351
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,960
<13-25,Amy>伯纳黛特  我想感谢你
<13-25,Amy>Bernadette, I want to thank you

352
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,100
<13-25,Amy>给我当你伴娘的机会
<13-25,Amy>for allowing me to be your maid of honor.

353
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,160
<13-25,Amy>我也想告诉你
<13-25,Amy>I also want you to know,

354
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,990
<13-25,Amy>如果你们以离婚告终
<13-25,Amy>that I will be happy to do it again

355
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,920
<13-25,Amy>我也愿再当你的伴娘
<13-25,Amy>if this marriage craps out.

356
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,730
<13-26,Leonard>谢谢致辞  艾米
<13-26,Leonard>Thank you, Amy.

357
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,550
<13-26,Leonard>"感人肺腑"啊
<13-26,Leonard>Very touching.

358
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,190
<13-26,Leonard>霍华德  伯纳黛特
<13-26,Leonard>Howard and Bernadette,

359
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,610
<13-26,Leonard>能与最好的朋友彼此相爱  实乃三生有幸
<13-26,Leonard>you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other.

360
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,950
<13-26,Leonard>这样的爱  情比金坚
<13-26,Leonard>And that's the strongest kind of love

361
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,580
<13-26,Leonard>因为你们的爱  充满着善意
<13-26,Leonard>because at its core, it has kindness,

362
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,110
<13-26,Leonard>耐心与尊重
<13-26,Leonard>patience, and respect.

363
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,100
<13-26,Leonard>这些优点在"某些人"身上偏寻不得啊
<13-26,Leonard>Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.

364
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,360
<13-27,Sheldon>要来点芦荟修复精华吗
<13-27,Sheldon>Would you like some aloe vera?

365
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,470
<13-27,Sheldon>你被人虐得体无完肤啊
<13-27,Sheldon>You just got burned.

366
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,200
<13-27,Sheldon>好啦  轮到我了
<13-27,Sheldon>All right, my turn.

367
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,790
<13-27,Sheldon>霍华德  伯纳黛特
<13-27,Sheldon>Howard, Bernadette...

369
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,410
<13-28,Bernadette>谢尔顿  说了不许用克林贡语
<13-28,Bernadette>Sheldon! I told you no Klingon!

370
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,380
<13-29,Sheldon>好吧  我用英语说
<13-29,Sheldon>Fine, I'll do it in English,

371
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,170
<13-29,Sheldon>但祝辞会略失风味
<13-29,Sheldon>but it loses something.

372
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,200
<13-29,Sheldon>人穷尽一生追寻另一个人类
<13-29,Sheldon>The need to find another human being

373
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,980
<13-29,Sheldon>共度一生的事
<13-29,Sheldon>to share one's life with,

374
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,870
<13-29,Sheldon>我一直无法理解
<13-29,Sheldon>has always puzzled me.

375
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,570
<13-29,Sheldon>或许我自己太有意思  无需他人陪伴
<13-29,Sheldon>Maybe because I'm so interesting all by myself.

376
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,500
<13-29,Sheldon>所以  我祝你们在对方身上得到的快乐
<13-29,Sheldon>With that being said, may you find as much happiness

377
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,680
<13-29,Sheldon>与我给自己的一样多
<13-29,Sheldon>with each other as I find on my own.

378
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,820
<13-29,Sheldon>克林贡版本绝对能让你们痛哭流涕
<13-29,Sheldon>The Klingon would have made you cry.

379
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,860
<13-30,Raj>你们两个准备了婚誓吧
<13-30,Raj>I believe you two have prepared vows?

380
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,540
<13-31,Bernadette>霍华德·约尔·沃罗威茨
<13-31,Bernadette>Howard Joel Wolowitz,

381
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,860
<13-31,Bernadette>我的婚誓如同你  短小但美妙
<13-31,Bernadette>like you, this is going to be short and sweet.

382
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,870
<13-31,Bernadette>我全心全意  从灵魂深处爱着你
<13-31,Bernadette>I love you with all my heart and soul

383
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,320
<13-31,Bernadette>我愿一生一世  与你永不分离
<13-31,Bernadette>and promise to be with you forever.

384
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,910
<13-32,Howard>伯纳黛特·玛丽安·罗斯滕科斯基
<13-32,Howard>Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

385
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,550
<13-33,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>大声点
<13-33,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Speak up!

386
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,590
<13-34,Howard>喂  现在起
<13-34,Howard>Hey, from now on,

387
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,730
<13-34,Howard>能吼我的女人只有她一个
<13-34,Howard>she's the only women who can yell at me!

388
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,510
<13-34,Howard>遇到你之前
<13-34,Howard>Until I met you,

389
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,330
<13-34,Howard>一生一爱
<13-34,Howard>I couldn't imagine

390
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,620
<13-34,Howard>共度一生对我如同天方夜谭
<13-34,Howard>spending my life with just one person...

391
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,760
<13-34,Howard>而现在
<13-34,Howard>...and now I can't imagine

392
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,550
<13-34,Howard>分离一刻  便有如生离死别
<13-34,Howard>spending one day of it without you.

393
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,280
<13-35,All>以我们被加利福尼亚州所赋予的权利
<13-35,All>By the power vested in us, by the state of California...

394
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,130
<13-36,Sheldon>与克林贡最高议会
<13-36,Sheldon>and the Klingon High Council...

395
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,290
<13-37,All>我们现在宣布你们成为夫妻
<13-37,All>...we now pronounce you husband and wife.

396
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,810
<14-1,Mike>开始点火了
<14-1,Mike>That's ignition.

397
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,680
<14-1,Mike>我爱死这部分了
<14-1,Mike>I love this part!

398
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,310
<14-2,Dimitri>我也爱
<14-2,Dimitri>Me, too!

399
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,430
<14-3,Howard>我内心五味杂陈啊
