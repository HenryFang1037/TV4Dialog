1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,290
<1-1,Raj>实在很难没发现
<1-1,Raj>So...couldn't help but notice

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,990
<1-1,Raj>你们全都没如约出席我的神秘谋杀周一夜派对
<1-1,Raj>none of you RSVP'd to my murder mystery dinner party.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,260
<1-2,Leonard>对哦
<1-2,Leonard>Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,770
<1-2,Leonard>我们正打算去呢
<1-2,Leonard>We were meaning to do that.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,350
<1-3,Raj>放屁  派对是上周的事了
<1-3,Raj>No, you weren't, because it was a week ago

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,470
<1-3,Raj>你们全都没来
<1-3,Raj>and nobody came!

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,450
<1-3,Raj>想知道是谁以"毫不在乎"为刃
<1-3,Raj>So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,140
<1-3,Raj>从背后捅死了库萨帕里的这个谜团吗
<1-3,Raj>Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference,

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,150
<1-3,Raj>凶手就是你们
<1-3,Raj>it was all of you.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,870
<1-4,Sheldon>这应该不算是个谜团吧
<1-4,Sheldon>I don't think that qualifies as a mystery.

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,960
<1-4,Sheldon>我们早知道是我们干的了
<1-4,Sheldon>We all knew what we were doing.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,240
<1-5,Amy>实在很抱歉  拉杰什
<1-5,Amy>We're sorry, Rajesh.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,720
<1-6,Bernadette>说不定我们下周再约一次啊
<1-6,Bernadette>Maybe we can do it next week.

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,350
<1-7,Howard>我们也没这么抱歉吧
<1-7,Howard>Whoa, whoa, we're not that sorry.

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,990
<1-8,Raj>不用啦  我懂你们的意思
<1-8,Raj>Don't worry, I can take a hint.

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,000
<1-8,Raj>不会再办神秘谋杀游戏派对了
<1-8,Raj>No more murder mystery parties.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,560
<1-10,Sheldon>-谢谢  -感谢老天
<1-10,Sheldon>- Thank you. - Hallelujah.

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,430
<1-12,Raj>因为我计划好了更棒的活动
<1-12,Raj>Because I've got something even better planned.

19
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,760
<1-13,Leonard>-为啥啊  -不是吧
<1-13,Leonard>- Aw! Why? - Come on.

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,260
<1-15,Sheldon>先听我说嘛
<1-15,Sheldon>Just hear me out.

21
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,460
<1-16,Raj>我计划给你们办一场
<1-16,Raj>I'm going to make you guys

22
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,360
<1-16,Raj>麻省理工学院式的寻宝游戏
<1-16,Raj>a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.

23
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,520
<1-17,Howard>我以前很爱玩呢
<1-17,Howard>I loved those.

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,890
<1-17,Howard>每年都去参加
<1-17,Howard>I did them every year there.

25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,430
<1-18,Leonard>我们普林斯顿大学也有呢
<1-18,Leonard>We did them at Princeton, too.

26
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,120
<1-19,Howard>傻孩子  那学校算哪门子大学啊
<1-19,Howard>Oh, that's cute. Like it's a real college.

27
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,660
<1-20,Sheldon>真有意思  我本来也打算这么说麻省理工的
<1-20,Sheldon>That's amusing-- I was going to say that about M.I.T.,

29
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,580
<1-20,Sheldon>不过拿去说普林斯顿大学也行
<1-20,Sheldon>but it works for Princeton, too.

30
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,110
<1-21,Amy>哈佛大学的寻宝游戏很有挑战性
<1-21,Amy>Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough.

31
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,080
<1-21,Amy>我总是在第一个关卡就卡住了
<1-21,Amy>I always got stuck on the first challenge--

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,730
<1-21,Amy>就是找到人愿意跟我组队的关卡
<1-21,Amy>trying to find someone to be on a team with me.

33
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,310
<1-21,Amy>看来这故事是"好惨"不是"好笑"
<1-21,Amy>I guess that story's more sad than funny.

34
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,080
<1-22,Penny>我也爱寻宝游戏
<1-22,Penny>I love scavenger hunts.

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,750
<1-22,Penny>我以前常跟朋友一起玩
<1-22,Penny>My friends and I had them all the time.

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,150
<1-23,Leonard>我们玩的应该有些差别
<1-23,Leonard>Oh, these are a little different.

37
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,320
<1-23,Leonard>这是在精英大学里...
<1-23,Leonard>There's a tradition at elite universities.

38
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,480
<1-24,Howard>以及普林斯顿大学
<1-24,Howard>And Princeton.

39
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,010
<1-25,Leonard>这寻宝游戏  内含无数谜题
<1-25,Leonard>A tradition of hunts full of puzzles

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,680
<1-25,Leonard>得靠逻辑  晦涩知识与科学来取胜
<1-25,Leonard>that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,300
<1-26,Penny>我们的寻宝游戏  就是到处找
<1-26,Penny>Oh, in ours we would just run around town

42
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,250
<1-26,Penny>愿意卖啤酒给未成年的店
<1-26,Penny>looking for a store that would sell us beer.

43
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,200
<1-27,Raj>谁要来玩
<1-27,Raj>So, uh, who's in?

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,870
<1-28,Leonard>-我觉得听起来挺好玩啊  -我也觉得
<1-28,Leonard>- I think it sounds fun. - Yeah, me, too.

45
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,730
<1-30,Various>-我参加  -来吧
<1-30,Various>- I'm in. - Let's do it.

46
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,950
<1-31,Sheldon>抱歉  我们是真要参加呢
<1-31,Sheldon>I'm sorry. Are we really doing this

47
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,500
<1-31,Sheldon>还是只是像上次派对那样
<1-31,Sheldon>or are we tricking Koothrappali again

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,580
<1-31,Sheldon>只是哄库萨帕里玩而已
<1-31,Sheldon>like with the dinner party?

50
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,830
<1-31,Sheldon>人人影视

58
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,990
<2-1,Leonard>这些是干啥的
<2-1,Leonard>What's all this?

59
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,800
<2-2,Sheldon>寻宝游戏中
<2-2,Sheldon>Oh, everything I could possibly need

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,840
<2-2,Sheldon>我可能会用到的东西
<2-2,Sheldon>to win the scavenger hunt.

61
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,320
<2-3,Leonard>你真觉得他会让我们去保龄球馆吗
<2-3,Leonard>You really think he's gonna send us to a bowling alley?

62
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,760
<2-4,Sheldon>如果真发生了
<2-4,Sheldon>Well, if he does,

63
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,600
<2-4,Sheldon>你知道球馆里的球有多脏吗
<2-4,Sheldon>do you know how filthy those rental balls are?

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,510
<2-4,Sheldon>其程度不亚于去街角
<2-4,Sheldon>They might as well stand on the corner

65
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,240
<2-4,Sheldon>帮人做免费的直肠指检
<2-4,Sheldon>and give away free rectal exams.

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,630
<2-5,Raj>好了  各位
<2-5,Raj>Okay, everybody.

67

71
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,240
<2-5,Raj>我藏了一枚金币
<2-5,Raj>I've hidden a golden coin.

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,380
<2-5,Raj>你们一共需要解出
<2-5,Raj>You will be faced with a total

73
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,040
<2-5,Raj>10道谜题
<2-5,Raj>of ten puzzles!

74
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,180
<2-5,Raj>每道
<2-5,Raj>Each p...

75

76
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,910
<2-5,Raj>每道谜题将带领你
<2-5,Raj>each puzzle will lead you

77
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,150
<2-5,Raj>到下一个指定地点
<2-5,Raj>to the location of the next.

78
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,520
<2-5,Raj>而最后的谜题
<2-5,Raj>The last of which

79
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,310
<2-5,Raj>将会指引你找到金币
<2-5,Raj>will lead you to the coin.

80
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,920
<2-5,Raj>第一个找到金币的队伍就
<2-5,Raj>The first team that finds it...

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,260
<2-5,Raj>赢了
<2-5,Raj>wins!

82
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,080
<2-6,Sheldon>他真是个天生的主持人
<2-6,Sheldon>He is a born showman.

83
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,620
<2-7,Raj>有问题吗
<2-7,Raj>Any questions?

84
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,270
<2-8,Howard>有  为了确保公平
<2-8,Howard>Yes, to be fair,

85
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,180
<2-8,Howard>是不是该让普林斯顿大学的先出发
<2-8,Howard>do people who went to Princeton get a head start?

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,900
<2-9,Leonard>不好笑好吗
<2-9,Leonard>That's not funny.

87
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,660
<2-10,Sheldon>如果你懂笑点就好笑了
<2-10,Sheldon>Oh, it actually is if you get the joke.

88
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,980
<2-10,Sheldon>这笑话是以
<2-10,Sheldon>It's based on the premise

89
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,610
<2-10,Sheldon>嘲讽普林斯顿是间烂学校为笑点
<2-10,Sheldon>that Princeton isn't a very good school.

90
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,260
<2-11,Leonard>笑死人了
<2-11,Leonard>Ha-ha.

91
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,340
<2-12,Sheldon>你们看  他懂笑点了
<2-12,Sheldon>Oh, see? Now he gets it.

92
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,630
<2-13,Raj>好了  大家
<2-13,Raj>Okay, guys, go ahead

93
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,100
<2-13,Raj>你们先选人组队  两人一组
<2-13,Raj>and divide yourselves into teams of two.

94
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,440
<2-14,Bernadette>我们要不就与各自伴侣吧
<2-14,Bernadette>Should we just do couples?

95
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,310
<2-15,Leonard>情侣一组不错
<2-15,Leonard>Couples sounds great.

96
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,230
<2-15,Leonard>或者我们可以混合一下
<2-15,Leonard>Or we could mix things up.

97
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,970
<2-15,Leonard>抽签决定跟谁一队吧
<2-15,Leonard>Maybe pick names out of a hat.

98
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,840
<2-15,Leonard>都行啦
<2-15,Leonard>Whatever.

99
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,160
<2-16,Penny>你干嘛不直接承认
<2-16,Penny>Why don't you just admit

100
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
<2-16,Penny>你不想跟我一队就好了
<2-16,Penny>you don't want to be on a team with me.

101
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,480
<2-17,Leonard>我刚也说"情侣一组不错"啦
<2-17,Leonard>I just said, "couples sound great."

102
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,830
<2-18,Penny>你就是觉得我不够聪明
<2-18,Penny>Yeah, you don't think I'm smart enough.

103
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,710
<2-18,Penny>你觉得我会是"千钧重负"
<2-18,Penny>You think I'm gonna be a liability.

104
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,900
<2-18,Penny>就算我刚刚才正确使用了
<2-18,Penny>Even though I totally just used

105
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,620
<2-18,Penny>"千钧重负"这个词  也还是不够
<2-18,Penny>the word "liability" correctly in a sentence.

106
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,550
<2-18,Penny>没错
<2-18,Penny>Yeah.

107
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,220
<2-19,Leonard>那就情侣组队吧
<2-19,Leonard>All right, let's-let's do couples.

108
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,080
<2-19,Leonard>我想跟你一队
<2-19,Leonard>I want to.

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,220
<2-19,Leonard>别  别  晚了
<2-19,Leonard>No, no, no.

110
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,600
<2-20,Penny>大家就混合一下
<2-20,Penny>Let's mix things up.

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,040
<2-20,Penny>我选跟谢尔顿组队  我们会让你输得一败涂地
<2-20,Penny>I choose Sheldon, and we're gonna kick your ass!

112
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,190
<2-20,Penny>非得选我吗
<2-20,Penny>Yeah... really?

113
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,940
<2-21,Sheldon>我第一次被人首选选入队
<2-21,Sheldon>The only time I'm ever picked first for a team

114
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,250
<2-21,Sheldon>结果却是跟"千钧重负"一队
<2-21,Sheldon>and I'm stuck with the liability?

115
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,180
<2-22,Amy>别这么说  佩妮才不是呢
<2-22,Amy>Stop that. Penny is not a liability.

116
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,880
<2-23,Penny>谢谢  你想跟我一队吗
<2-23,Penny>Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?

117
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,790
<2-24,Amy>我们还是抽签决定吧
<2-24,Amy>Maybe we pick names out of a hat.

118
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,860
<3-1,Penny>快点过来  然后把门关上
<3-1,Penny>All right, hurry up and close the door

119
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,770
<3-1,Penny>这样他们才听不到我们说话
<3-1,Penny>so they can't hear us.

120
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,950
<3-1,Penny>可以别不甘心地扁嘴了吗
<3-1,Penny>Would you stop pouting?

121
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,060
<3-1,Penny>是说你自己抽中了我名字
<3-1,Penny>So, you picked my name.

122
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,110
<3-1,Penny>乖乖接受这事实吧
<3-1,Penny>Get over it.

123
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,370
<3-2,Sheldon>好的  你知道我抽中你名字的
<3-2,Sheldon>Yes, and do you know what the odds are

124
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,400
<3-2,Sheldon>-几率是多少吗  -不知道
<3-2,Sheldon>- I'd pick your name? - No.

125
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,870
<3-4,Sheldon>不难啊  五分之一嘛
<3-4,Sheldon>It's not hard-- one in five.

126
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,170
<3-4,Sheldon>现在你知道我为什么扁嘴了
<3-4,Sheldon>Now you know why I'm pouting.

127
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,930
<3-4,Sheldon>所有队伍听好
<3-4,Sheldon>All right, teams.

128
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,430
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>准备打开你们第一道谜题吧
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>Get ready to open your first puzzle.

129
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,870
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>开始
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>Go!

130
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,660
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>瞧我多有哏
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>Do you see what I did?

131
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,990
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>第一道谜题就是拼图[谜题]
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>The first puzzle is a puzzle!

132
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,580
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>天啊  我真是太佩服我自己了
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>Oh, my God, how adorable is that?

133
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,020
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>真希望有一个像我一样的朋友
<3-5,Raj (over walkie-talkie)>I wish I had a friend like me.

134
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,560
<3-6,Sheldon>你在干什么
<3-6,Sheldon>What are you doing?

135
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,110
<3-6,Sheldon>你得先从边缘开始
<3-6,Sheldon>You have to start with the edges.

136
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,190
<3-7,Penny>拼图没有正确的方式  谢尔顿
<3-7,Penny>Well, there's no right way, Sheldon.

137
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,930
<3-7,Penny>我已经拼好了几块了
<3-7,Penny>I already found a few pieces that fit.

138
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,860
<3-8,Sheldon>那就拆了  然后从边缘开始拼
<3-8,Sheldon>Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges.

139
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,440
<3-8,Sheldon>不要浪费时间了
<3-8,Sheldon>And stop wasting time.

140
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,650
<3-9,Howard>你拼图真厉害
<3-9,Howard>Wow, you're really good at puzzles.

141
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,340
<3-10,Amy>我小时候经常玩拼图
<3-10,Amy>I did them all the time as a kid.

142
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,640
<3-10,Amy>我妈以前常跟我说
<3-10,Amy>As my mom used to say,

143
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,740
<3-10,Amy>"当你在玩拼图时
<3-10,Amy>"When you're doing a puzzle,

144
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,410
<3-10,Amy>就像有成千上百个好友在跟你一起玩"
<3-10,Amy>it's like having a thousand friends."

145
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,450
<3-10,Amy>那时的她  总是爱说善意的谎言
<3-10,Amy>She was full of fun lies like that.

146
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,200
<3-11,Howard>如果能让你好过点
<3-11,Howard>If it makes you feel any better,

147
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,620
<3-11,Howard>我小时候我妈总是在吃大蛋糕
<3-11,Howard>my mom's just full of pound cake.

148
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,630
<3-12,Amy>抱歉你得跟我组队
<3-12,Amy>I'm sorry you got stuck with me.

149
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,050
<3-12,Amy>我猜你一定想跟伯纳黛特一起
<3-12,Amy>I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.

150
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,760
<3-13,Howard>-你有跟伯纳黛特玩过游戏吗  -没有
<3-13,Howard>- Have you ever played a game with Bernadette? - No.

151
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,290
<3-15,Howard>感觉就跟和狼獾一起关在铁笼子里一样
<3-15,Howard>Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?

152
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,600
<3-16,Bernadette>快点  快点  快点
<3-16,Bernadette>Faster, faster, faster!

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,410
<3-16,Bernadette>你懂那个词的意思吗
<3-16,Bernadette>Do you not know that word?

154
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,230
<3-16,Bernadette>快点就是"加快一点"
<3-16,Bernadette>It means "more fast"!

155
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,740
<3-17,Leonard>别对我大声嚷嚷
<3-17,Leonard>Stop yelling at me.

156
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,730
<3-17,Leonard>喂
<3-17,Leonard>Hey!

157
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,780
<3-18,Bernadette>现在老娘还不算在嚷你呢
<3-18,Bernadette>You'll know when I'm yelling at you.

158
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,830
<3-19,Penny>我知道了  是漫画书店
<3-19,Penny>Ooh, ooh, it's the comic book store!

159
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,590
<3-19,Penny>好了  快走吧
<3-19,Penny>All right, come on.

160
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,670
<3-19,Penny>那是我们下一个目的地
<3-19,Penny>That's where we have to go.

161
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,860
<3-20,Sheldon>但我们拼图没拼完呢
<3-20,Sheldon>But we haven't finished the puzzle.

162
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,730
<3-21,Penny>那有什么关系啊
<3-21,Penny>Well, it-it doesn't matter!

163
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,070
<3-21,Penny>我们都知道答案了  快走吧
<3-21,Penny>We know the answer! Come on.

164
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,160
<3-22,Sheldon>是你觉得你知道答案了
<3-22,Sheldon>You think you know the answer.

165
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,690
<3-22,Sheldon>但这可能是陷阱
<3-22,Sheldon>But it could be a trick.

166
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,590
<3-22,Sheldon>万一等拼图拼完
<3-22,Sheldon>What if when the puzzle's complete,

167
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,370
<3-22,Sheldon>我们发现图中有个窗户示意我们
<3-22,Sheldon>there's a sign in the window that says,

168
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,830
<3-24,Sheldon>"去小火车商店"呢
<3-24,Sheldon>"Go to the train store"?

169
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,330
<3-23,Penny>肯定不会这样的
<3-23,Penny>Okay, it's not gonna say that.

170
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,950
<3-24,Sheldon>我希望你是错的
<3-24,Sheldon>Well, I hope you're wrong.

171
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,940
<3-24,Sheldon>因为我真的很想去小火车商店
<3-24,Sheldon>I really want to go to the train store.

172
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,090
<3-27,Penny>是漫画书店
<3-27,Penny>It's the comic book store.

173
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,220
<3-25,Howard>快走
<3-25,Howard>Let's go!

174
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,810
<3-26,Bernadette>快点  笨蛋
<3-26,Bernadette>Come on, numb nuts,

175
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,510
<3-27,Penny>是漫画书店
<3-27,Penny>it's the comic book store!

176
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,310
<3-27,Penny>漫画书店  是漫画书店
<3-27,Penny>It's the comic book store, it's the comic book store,

177
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,560
<3-27,Penny>就是漫画书商店啦
<3-27,Penny>it's the comic book store!

178
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,050
<3-27,Penny>果然是漫画书商店
<3-27,Penny>It's the comic book store.

179
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,520
<4-1,Leonard>你觉得佩妮在生我的气吗
<4-1,Leonard>Do you think Penny's mad at me?

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,910
<4-2,Bernadette>因为你行驶在右侧车道
<4-2,Bernadette>Because you're in the right lane behind a bus

181
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,870
<4-2,Bernadette>又不敢超巴士的车吗
<4-2,Bernadette>and you won't go around it?

182
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,150
<4-2,Bernadette>她肯定觉得遵守交规很迷人
<4-2,Bernadette>I'm sure she finds it charming.

183
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,620
<4-3,Leonard>不  是因为我不想跟她组队
<4-3,Leonard>No, because I didn't want her on my team.

184
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,910
<4-4,Bernadette>我倒是觉得她逃过了一劫
<4-4,Bernadette>I'm starting to think she dodged a bullet.

185
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,690
<4-4,Bernadette>世上最龟速最难熬的一劫
<4-4,Bernadette>The slowest bullet in the world.

186
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,810
<4-5,Leonard>我从来不知道你好胜心这么强
<4-5,Leonard>Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.

187
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,360
<4-5,Leonard>对啊  我懂你意思
<4-5,Leonard>Yeah, I know.

188
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,820
<4-6,Bernadette>可能是因为我有
<4-6,Bernadette>It's-it's probably because I grew up

189
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,270
<4-6,Bernadette>五个兄弟姐妹
<4-6,Bernadette>with five brothers and sisters

190
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,440
<4-6,Bernadette>所以我每次都得跟他们争
<4-6,Bernadette>so I had to fight for every...

191
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,100
<4-6,Bernadette>天啊  你刚居然因为一只鸟减速了
<4-6,Bernadette>Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird!

192
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,520
<4-6,Bernadette>你知道它们会飞走的吧
<4-6,Bernadette>You know they fly, right?!

193
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,020
<5-1,Amy>我觉得这是我们第一次
<5-1,Amy>I think this is the first time we've ever

194
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,000
<5-1,Amy>真正意义上的独处
<5-1,Amy>actually been alone together.

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,640
<5-2,Howard>你说得对
<5-2,Howard>Huh, I guess you're right.

196
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,310
<5-2,Howard>为什么会这样呢
<5-2,Howard>Wonder why that is?

197
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,490
<5-3,Amy>我第一个想到的就是
<5-3,Amy>Well, off the top of my head,

198
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,050
<5-3,Amy>我们没什么共同点
<5-3,Amy>I'd say we don't have a lot in common

199
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,240
<5-3,Amy>除了因为各自伴侣  所以朋友圈有了交集
<5-3,Amy>except for the people we're involved with.

200
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,380
<5-3,Amy>而且我们第一次见面时
<5-3,Amy>Plus, when we first met,

201
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,720
<5-3,Amy>佩妮告诫过我  千万不要单独跟你一起坐车
<5-3,Amy>Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.

202
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,810
<5-3,Amy>说的没错
<5-3,Amy>Yeah.

203
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,320
<5-4,Howard>我觉得我们的共同点肯定比想象中要多
<5-4,Howard>You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.

204
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
<5-5,Amy>比如说
<5-5,Amy>Such as?

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,450
<5-6,Howard>我也不知道
<5-6,Howard>I don't know.

206
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,840
<5-6,Howard>告诉我你喜欢什么
<5-6,Howard>Tell me some things you like.

207
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,120
<5-7,Amy>我想想
<5-7,Amy>Uh, let's see.

211
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,660
<5-8,Howard>不如我们来听点音乐
<5-8,Howard>Hey, how about some music?

212
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,730
<5-8,Howard>好呀
<5-8,Howard>Great.

213
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,890
<5-9,Amy>谢尔顿就从来不让我在车里听音乐
<5-9,Amy>Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car.

214
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,590
<5-9,Amy>他不想被人误会是黑帮成员
<5-9,Amy>He doesn't want to be mistaken for a gang member.

215
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,570
<5-10,Howard>挑你喜欢的听吧

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,800
<6-8,Howard>"这个英雄是军团成员"
<6-8,Howard>The work of this hero is legion-bound.

252
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,220
<6-8,Howard>"他用N乘以He的数字"
<6-8,Howard>He multiplies N by the number of He,

253
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,190
<6-8,Howard>"就在此房所见的它山之石中"
<6-8,Howard>and in this room the thing you'll see."

254
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,660
<6-9,Raj>-谜语不错吧  -是啊
<6-9,Raj>- Good riddle, huh? - Yeah.

255
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,390
<6-10,Stuart>所以你们这群人每次玩好玩的
<6-10,Stuart>So when you guys plan fun activities,

256
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,730
<6-10,Stuart>就没有想到过
<6-10,Stuart>does my name even...

257
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,480
<6-10,Stuart>我的名字吗
<6-10,Stuart>come up, or...?

<6-11,Raj>我邀请你参加我的神秘谋杀派对了
<6-11,Raj>I invited you to my murder mystery party.

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,610
<6-12,Stuart>你没有
<6-12,Stuart>No, you didn't.

260
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,840
<6-14,Penny>我们是最后一个到的  快点
<6-14,Penny>We're the last ones here, hurry up!

261
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,770
<6-15,Sheldon>这是马拉松  不是短跑
<6-15,Sheldon>It is a marathon, not a sprint.

262
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,950
<6-16,Penny>马拉松也是用跑的啊
<6-16,Penny>People run in a marathon!

263
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,630
<6-17,Sheldon>他们又没背着保龄球跑
<6-17,Sheldon>Not with a bowling ball on their back.

264
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,750
<6-18,Leonard>佩妮  我想祝你好运
<6-18,Leonard>Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck,

265
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,150
<6-18,Leonard>希望你心里不会不高兴
<6-18,Leonard>and I hope there's no hard feelings.

266
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,300
<6-19,Bernadette>喂  罗密欧
<6-19,Bernadette>Hey, Romeo!

267
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,510
<6-19,Bernadette>想修复感情  麻烦用你自己的时间
<6-19,Bernadette>Repair your relationship on your own time.

268
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,850
<6-20,Leonard>别紧张嘛  这谜语这么难
<6-20,Leonard>Relax, it's a hard puzzle.

269
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,230
<6-20,Leonard>解开是需要一点时间的
<6-20,Leonard>It's gonna take a while to solve.

270
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,010
<6-21,Penny>-"猜一猜"  -我知道了
<6-21,Penny>- "Riddle me this..." - Got it.

271
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,210
<6-23,Penny>瞧啊  普林斯顿
<6-23,Penny>Hey, Princeton, look at that,

272
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,540
<6-23,Penny>社区大学夜校队领先啦
<6-23,Penny>Team Community College Night School is in the lead.

273
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,910
<6-24,Sheldon>我们不是闪电鲨鱼队吗
<6-24,Sheldon>I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.

274
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,120
<6-25,Howard>这个的意思可能是
<6-25,Howard>Hey, you know what this could mean...

275
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,810
<6-26,Amy>很好
<6-26,Amy>Oh, oh, that's good.

276
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,990
<6-26,Amy>那这个就是
<6-26,Amy>Then this would be...

277
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,400
<6-27,Howard>就是这个
<6-27,Howard>That's it.

278
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,250
<6-28,Amy>回我们的"尼尔"战车
<6-28,Amy>To the Neil Mobile!

279
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,620
<6-29,Bernadette>我就知道我们会输的
<6-29,Bernadette>I knew it, we're gonna lose!

280
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,150
<6-30,Leonard>等一下  我知道了  我知道了
<6-30,Leonard>Wait, I got it. I got it!

281
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,740
<6-31,Bernadette>恭喜你  "最后一个"想出来了
<6-31,Bernadette>Congratulations, you got it last.

282
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,090
<6-32,Leonard>你知道你超级毒舌吗
<6-32,Leonard>You're really mean, you know that?

283
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,830
<6-33,Stuart>所以最后也没人要买东西
<6-33,Stuart>So no one's gonna buy anything.

284
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,890
<6-33,Stuart>好的
<6-33,Stuart>Okay...

285
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,200
<6-33,Stuart>瞧瞧看
<6-33,Stuart>Let's see.

286
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
<7-1,Penny>"要想继续你们的探索
<7-1,Penny>"To continue on your quest,

287
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,510
<7-1,Penny>就要翻个水落石出"
<7-1,Penny>leave no stone unturned."

288
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,320
<7-2,Sheldon>下一条线索可能在这里的
<7-2,Sheldon>The next clue must be hidden

289
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,790
<7-2,Sheldon>某个"石"头下面
<7-2,Sheldon>under one of these rocks.

290
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,960
<7-3,Penny>好的
<7-3,Penny>Oh. Okay.

291
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,820
<7-3,Penny>谢尔顿  我很好奇
<7-3,Penny>Sheldon, I-I've got to ask.

292
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,490
<7-3,Penny>你怎么知道答案是地质实验室的
<7-3,Penny>How did you figure out that it was the geology lab?

293
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,350
<7-4,Sheldon>简单
<7-4,Sheldon>Oh, simple.

294
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,790
<7-4,Sheldon>谜语中"阿拉  阿拉"代表震·阿拉
<7-4,Sheldon>The "Arrah, Arrah" In the riddle meant Jan Arrah,

295
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,400
<7-4,Sheldon>他是"超级英雄军团"的成员
<7-4,Sheldon>a member of the Legion of Superheroes,

296
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,610
<7-4,Sheldon>也就是元素小子
<7-4,Sheldon>known as Element Lad.

297
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,990
<7-4,Sheldon>然后"He"这个词[他]
<7-4,Sheldon>And then the word "He,"

298
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,630
<7-4,Sheldon>不是代表男性的名词
<7-4,Sheldon>it wasn't the masculine pronoun,

299
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,020
<7-4,Sheldon>而是"H-E"
<7-4,Sheldon>but rather, "H-E,"

300
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,620
<7-4,Sheldon>是氦的简写
<7-4,Sheldon>the abbreviation for helium.

301
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,430
<7-4,Sheldon>明白我的思路了吗
<7-4,Sheldon>See where I'm going with this?

302
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,980
<7-5,Penny>明白
<7-5,Penny>Yes.

303
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,730
<7-6,Sheldon>少装蒜了
<7-6,Sheldon>Nice try.

304
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,850
<7-6,Sheldon>元素小子的能力
<7-6,Sheldon>Now, Element Lad's ability

305
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,960
<7-6,Sheldon>是让化学元素变质
<7-6,Sheldon>is the power to transmute chemical elements.

306
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,620
<7-6,Sheldon>而氦的原子序数是2
<7-6,Sheldon>Helium has an atomic number of two.

307
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,610
<7-6,Sheldon>如果你用2乘以N的原子序数
<7-6,Sheldon>If you multiply that by the atomic number of "N"--

308
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,560
<7-6,Sheldon>N是氮
<7-6,Sheldon>nitrogen--

309
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,990
<7-6,Sheldon>就是14  而14是什么的原子序数呢
<7-6,Sheldon>you get 14, which is the atomic number of...?

310
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,940
<7-6,Sheldon>我就知道你不懂  是硅
<7-6,Sheldon>I'm just funnin' you, silicon.

311
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,590
<7-6,Sheldon>而硅是地表最常见的元素
<7-6,Sheldon>And that is the most common element in the Earth's surface.

312
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,850
<7-6,Sheldon>因此范围就缩小至
<7-6,Sheldon>So that narrowed it down

313
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,090
<7-6,Sheldon>地质实验室  或化学实验室
<7-6,Sheldon>to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.

314
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,970
<7-7,Penny>我可以在水下喝啤酒哦
<7-7,Penny>I can drink a beer underwater.

315
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,560
<7-8,Sheldon>我肯定你的父母以你为傲
<7-8,Sheldon>And I'm sure your parents are proud.

316
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,760
<7-8,Sheldon>最后
<7-8,Sheldon>Now, finally,

317
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,380
<7-8,Sheldon>谜语说"就在此房所见的它山之石"
<7-8,Sheldon>the line "in this room the thing you'll see"

318
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,630
<7-8,Sheldon>明显是在指
<7-8,Sheldon>was an obvious reference

319
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,600
<7-8,Sheldon>与"它"同字的神奇四侠的成员"石"头人
<7-8,Sheldon>to Fantastic Four member The Thing,

320
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,780
<7-8,Sheldon>他是由什么东西造的呢
<7-8,Sheldon>who's made entirely of...

321
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,450
<7-9,Penny>闭嘴
<7-9,Penny>Shut up.

322
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,360
<7-9,Penny>我想到了
<7-9,Penny>I solved it.

323
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,240
<7-10,Sheldon>这是地图坐标
<7-10,Sheldon>Those are map coordinates.

324
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,150
<7-10,Sheldon>知道了  我们走
<7-10,Sheldon>Got 'em. Let's go.

325
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,080
<7-11,Penny>等一下
<7-11,Penny>Well, wait.

326
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,390
<7-11,Penny>你不想知道我是怎么想到的吗
<7-11,Penny>D-Don't you want to know how I figured it out?

327
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,780
<7-12,Sheldon>没人喜欢显摆自己博学的人  佩妮
<7-12,Sheldon>No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.

328
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,600
<8-1,Howard>* 在船上  在飞机上*

<8-3,Howard>* They're coming to America *

333
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,120
<8-3,Howard>你开我的车  我没意见
<8-3,Howard>Um, I'm okay with you driving my car.

334
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,130
<9-1,Leonard>但你能不能别玩漂移呀
<9-1,Leonard>I'm not okay with you flying my car.

335
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,430
<9-2,Bernadette>别紧张兮兮的  我老爸是警察
<9-2,Bernadette>Don't sweat it, my dad's a cop.

336
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,920
<9-2,Bernadette>出事了他会搞定
<9-2,Bernadette>He can fix things.

337
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,320
<9-3,Leonard>他能起死回生吗
<9-3,Leonard>Like death?

338

<9-4,Bernadette (out of the window)>你的孩子或许是优等生
<9-4,Bernadette (out of the window)>Your kid may be an honor student

339

<9-4,Bernadette (out of the window)>可你是个蠢货
<9-4,Bernadette (out of the window)>but you're a moron!

340
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,800
<9-5,Leonard>佩妮没回我的短信
<9-5,Leonard>Penny's not answering my texts.

341
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,590
<9-6,Bernadette>随便啦  专心比赛
<9-6,Bernadette>Who cares? Focus on the game.

342
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,120
<9-7,Leonard>她就是因为这傻了吧唧的比赛才生我的气
<9-7,Leonard>This stupid game is why she's mad in the first place.

<9-7,Leonard>-我要告诉她我退出  -不行
<9-7,Leonard>- I'm telling her I'm quitting. - No!

<9-8,Bernadette>Quitting would be the worst thing

345
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,790
<9-8,Bernadette>-会伤害你们感情的  -为什么

346
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,130
<9-10,Bernadette>这样你就真的成了
<9-10,Bernadette>Because it would make you seem like

347
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,120
<9-10,Bernadette>她认为你是的那种人了
<9-10,Bernadette>something she already thinks you are.

348
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,530
<9-11,Leonard>她觉得我是哪种人
<9-11,Leonard>What does she think I am?

349
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,540
<9-12,Bernadette>我该怎么说呢
<9-12,Bernadette>How do I put this?

350
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,000
<9-12,Bernadette>她一直在背后给你起外号
<9-12,Bernadette>She's been known to call you a name

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,750

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,810
<11-3,Sheldon>万岁
<11-3,Sheldon>Yes!

370
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,330
<11-3,Sheldon>朕是全世界最聪明的人
<11-3,Sheldon>My brain is better than everybody's!

372
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,360
<12-1,Howard>* 爱情触礁 *
<12-1,Howard>* Love on the rocks *

373
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,850
<12-2,Amy>*并不意外 *
<12-2,Amy>* Ain't no big surprise *

374
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,440
<12-3,Howard>* 给我倒杯酒 *
<12-3,Howard>* Just pour me a drink *

375
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,260
<12-4,Amy>* 我会告诉你一些谎言 *
<12-4,Amy>* And I'll tell you some lies... *

376
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,620
<12-4,Amy>居然说我娘炮
<12-4,Amy>Call me a lady part.

377
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,560
<13-1,Leonard>老子要用行动去证明
<13-1,Leonard>We'll see about that.

378
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,160
<13-2,Bernadette>你能看见迷题吗
<13-2,Bernadette>Can you reach the clue?

379
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,110
<13-3,Leonard>差不多了
<13-3,Leonard>Almost.

380
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,470
<13-4,Bernadette>快点  谢尔顿和佩妮
<13-4,Bernadette>Hurry, Sheldon and Penny

381
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,750
<13-4,Bernadette>在保龄球馆时就在我们后面
<13-4,Bernadette>were right behind us in the bowling alley.

382
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,840
<13-5,Leonard>看到了
<13-5,Leonard>Got it!

383
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,140
<13-6,Bernadette>太棒了  爬上来
<13-6,Bernadette>Great, climb back up.

384
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,660
<13-6,Bernadette>爬啊
<13-6,Bernadette>Come on!

385
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,850
<13-7,Leonard>佩妮说的话也不是完全没有道理
<13-7,Leonard>Yeah, Penny might be onto something.

386
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,910
<14-1,Sheldon>去天文馆
<14-1,Sheldon>To the planetarium!

387
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,690
<14-1,Sheldon>出发
<14-1,Sheldon>Let's go!

388
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,410
<14-1,Sheldon>去拉布雷亚沥青坑[洛杉矶考古遗址]
<14-1,Sheldon>To the tar pits!

389
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,070
<14-1,Sheldon>出发
<14-1,Sheldon>Let's go!

390
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,070
<14-1,Sheldon>下个月有尼尔·戴蒙德的演唱会
<14-1,Sheldon>There's a Neil Diamond concert next month!

391
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,960
<14-1,Sheldon>去吧[出发]
<14-1,Sheldon>Let's go!

392
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,110
<14-1,Sheldon>三个袋子  没人打开
<14-1,Sheldon>Three bags, no one's opened 'em.

393
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,680
<17-1,Penny>我们是最先到的
<17-1,Penny>We're the first ones here!

394
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,280
<17-2,Sheldon>这袋是脏衣服  给你
<17-2,Sheldon>It's dirty laundry. You're up.

395
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,970
<17-3,Penny>为什么是我
<17-3,Penny>Why me?

396
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,210
<17-4,Sheldon>你为此做了一辈子的训练准备
<17-4,Sheldon>Because you've been training for this your whole life.

397
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,090
<17-4,Sheldon>你生活在一堆脏衣服之中
<17-4,Sheldon>You live in a pile of dirty laundry.

398
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,020
<17-5,Bernadette>他们先到了
<17-5,Bernadette>They're here first.

399
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,300
<17-5,Bernadette>都怪你逼我为那个盲人减速让路
<17-5,Bernadette>This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.

400
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,400
<17-6,Penny>线索肯定在袋子里
<17-6,Penny>Okay, the clue must be in the bag.

401
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,070
<17-7,Leonard>线索肯定在袋子里
<17-7,Leonard>The clue must be in the bag.

402
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,760
<17-8,Penny>只是一堆裤子
<17-8,Penny>What's... it's just a bunch of pants.

403
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,490
<17-8,Penny>只是一堆裤子
<17-8,Penny>It's just a bunch of pants.

404
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,490
<17-10,Penny>我很意外你居然抄袭我的答案
<17-10,Penny>You know, I'm surprised you want to copy my answers

405
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,450
<17-10,Penny>毕竟我蠢到根本不配和你一组
<17-10,Penny>since I'm not even smart enough to be on your team.

406
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,810
<17-11,Leonard>你为什么想和我一组
<17-11,Leonard>Well, why would you want to be on someone's team

407
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,140
<17-11,Leonard>你不是管我叫...
<17-11,Leonard>who you like to call a...

408
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,760
<17-11,Leonard>这词我都不敢当着谢尔顿的面说
<17-11,Leonard>I can't even say it in front of Sheldon.

409
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,620
<17-12,Penny>你在说什么呢
<17-12,Penny>What are you talking about?

410
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,700
<17-13,Leonard>你心知肚明
<17-13,Leonard>You know exactly what I'm talking about.

411
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,300
<17-14,Bernadette>不  她不知道
<17-14,Bernadette>No, she doesn't.

412
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,940
<17-14,Bernadette>我瞎掰的
<17-14,Bernadette>I just made that up.

413
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,130
<17-15,Leonard>你为什么要这样做
<17-15,Leonard>Why would you do that?

414
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,570
<17-16,Bernadette>因为你想退出  就像一个大...
<17-16,Bernadette>Because you were about to quit like a big--

415
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,030
<17-16,Bernadette>谢尔顿  捂住耳朵
<17-16,Bernadette>Sheldon, cover your ears.

416
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,310
<17-17,Sheldon>我不是小孩子了
<17-17,Sheldon>I'm not a child.

417
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,280
<17-17,Sheldon>我知道"笨笨"这个词
<17-17,Sheldon>I know the word "ninny."

418
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,680
<17-18,Penny>你应该退出
<17-18,Penny>Yeah, well, you should have quit

419
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,350
<17-18,Penny>因为我会让你输得一败涂地
<17-18,Penny>'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.

420
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,190
<17-19,Bernadette>有个像她一样的女汉子和我一组就好了
<17-19,Bernadette>Wish I had a man like her on my team.

421
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,940
<17-20,Leonard>我从头到脚
<17-20,Leonard>Hey, I-I am every bit

422
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,420
<17-20,Leonard>都和佩妮一样有爷们气概  好吗
<17-20,Leonard>as much of a man as Penny.

423
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,450
<17-20,Leonard>开工吧
<17-20,Leonard>Now, let's do this!

424
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,670
<17-21,Sheldon>慢着  不全是裤子  还有件T恤
<17-21,Sheldon>Wait, it's not all pants, there's one shirt.

425
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,140
<17-23,Sheldon>这是我的T恤
<17-23,Sheldon>Hey, that's my shirt.

426
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,340
<17-24,Leonard>这件也是
<17-24,Leonard>This one is, too.

427
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,400
<17-25,Sheldon>不  那件不是我的
<17-25,Sheldon>No, no, that's not mine.

428
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
<17-25,Sheldon>上面有一大块污点
<17-25,Sheldon>That has a big spot on it.

429
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,100
<17-26,Penny>慢着
<17-26,Penny>But wait.

430
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,270
<17-26,Penny>这件也一样
<17-26,Penny>So does this one.

431
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,510
<17-27,Bernadette>也许这个污点是线索
<17-27,Bernadette>Maybe the spot's the clue.

432
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,950
<17-28,Penny>谢尔顿的专座[污点]
<17-28,Penny>"Sheldon's spot."

433
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,710
<17-28,Penny>金币在你专座那里
<17-28,Penny>The coin is in your spot!

434
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,490
<17-29,Sheldon>-真聪明  -那就快点啊
<17-29,Sheldon>- Oh, that's clever. - Hurry!

435
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,440
<17-31,Sheldon>我马上就来
<17-31,Sheldon>Be there in a minute.

436
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,640
<17-31,Sheldon>我得把脏T恤先泡一下
<17-31,Sheldon>I just have to pre-soak these!

437
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,120
<18-1,Bernadette>拦住她  莱纳德  拦住她
<18-1,Bernadette>Stop her, Leonard! Stop her!

438
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,620
<18-2,Penny>那金币他娘的上哪去了
<18-2,Penny>Well, where the hell's the coin?

439
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,710
<18-3,Leonard>难道答案不是谢尔顿的专座吗
<18-3,Leonard>Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot?

440
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,030
<18-4,Raj>是的  莱纳德
<18-4,Raj>Oh, yes, Leonard.

441
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,860
<18-4,Raj>答案完全正确
<18-4,Raj>Yes, it was.

442
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,910
<18-5,Bernadette>那金币在哪里
<18-5,Bernadette>Then where's the coin?

443
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,550
<18-6,Raj>问得太好了
<18-6,Raj>Yes, exactly.

444
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,660
<18-6,Raj>金币在哪里呢
<18-6,Raj>Where is the coin?

445
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,060
<18-6,Raj>你们为什么不看看自己的口袋呢
<18-6,Raj>Why don't you look in your pockets?

446
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,230
<18-6,Raj>我今天早些时候悄悄放进去的
<18-6,Raj>I slipped them in there earlier today.

447
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,640
<18-7,Penny>我不明白
<18-7,Penny>I don't get it.

448
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,490
<18-8,Raj>你还不明白吗
<18-8,Raj>Don't you see?

449
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,230
<18-8,Raj>大家一起玩得很开心时
<18-8,Raj>When we're all having fun together,

450
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,330
<18-8,Raj>每个人都是赢家
<18-8,Raj>we're already winners.

451
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,500
<18-8,Raj>看
<18-8,Raj>Oh, look.

452
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,200
<18-8,Raj>瞧
<18-8,Raj>See?

453
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,970
<18-8,Raj>就连我也是赢家
<18-8,Raj>Even I'm a winner.

454
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,090
<18-9,Leonard>你是不是玩儿我呢
<18-9,Leonard>Are you kidding me?

455
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,770
<18-10,Penny>这是我听过最傻逼的事
<18-10,Penny>That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

456
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,720
<18-11,Bernadette>你真是烂到爆了
<18-11,Bernadette>You suck so hard.

457
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,510
<18-11,Bernadette>我以为
<18-11,Bernadette>Well, I thought...

458
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,410
<18-12,Raj>拜托  我不希望任何人
<18-12,Raj>Come on, I didn't want anyone

459
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,460
<18-12,Raj>在游戏结束时  因为输了而难过
<18-12,Raj>to feel bad at the end of the game.

460
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,640
<18-12,Raj>有些谜题真的很难
<18-12,Raj>And some of those puzzles were really hard

461
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,210
<18-12,Raj>我不知道谁会倒霉得和佩妮一组啊
<18-12,Raj>and I didn't know who was gonna get Penny.

462
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,840
<18-13,Penny>滚
<18-13,Penny>Run.

463
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,730
<18-14,Raj>好吧  这话是我说得不好
<18-14,Raj>Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong,

464
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,840
<18-14,Raj>但你们得承认
<18-14,Raj>but you have to admit,
