1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,690
<1-1,Leonard>这是《权力的游戏》里的那把
<1-1,Leonard>It's from Game of Thrones.

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,690
<1-1,Leonard>你觉得怎样
<1-1,Leonard>What do you think?

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,500
<1-1,Leonard>不知道
<1-1,Leonard>I don't know.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,210
<1-2,Sheldon>如果我们要开始收藏奇幻剧中的刀剑
<1-2,Sheldon>If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection--

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,470
<1-2,Sheldon>虽然我很久前就认为应该收藏
<1-2,Sheldon>and I've long thought we should--

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,860
<1-2,Sheldon>但真的要从这把开始吗
<1-2,Sheldon>is this really the sword to start with?

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,470
<1-3,Leonard>那你想从哪把开始
<1-3,Leonard>What did you have in mind?

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,050
<1-4,Sheldon>我会不假思索地说  亚瑟王的神剑
<1-4,Sheldon>Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with Excalibur.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,570
<1-4,Sheldon>它能赋予你统治英格兰的权力
<1-4,Sheldon>It gives you the right to rule England.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,060
<1-5,Leonard>那肯定是电影道具的复制品
<1-5,Leonard>It would be a replica of a movie prop.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,690
<1-6,Sheldon>也有道理
<1-6,Sheldon>Fair enough.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,940
<1-6,Sheldon>那就是赋予你统治英格兰复制品的权力
<1-6,Sheldon>It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,900
<1-7,Leonard>这里没有亚瑟王的神剑
<1-7,Leonard>Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,320
<1-7,Leonard>你觉得该怎么办
<1-7,Leonard>so what do you want to do?

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,900
<1-8,Sheldon>真是艰难的抉择
<1-8,Sheldon>Mm. Tough decision.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,790
<1-8,Sheldon>这里没有中国血汗工厂伪造的那种
<1-8,Sheldon>There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,520
<1-8,Sheldon>《指环王》里的武器吗
<1-8,Sheldon>forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,030
<1-9,Leonard>只有比尔博·巴金斯的剑在那边
<1-9,Leonard>Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,470
<1-10,Sheldon>俩成年男子拿着把霍比特人的短剑  看着不傻吗
<1-10,Sheldon>Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly?

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,050
<1-10,Sheldon>好了  就这把了
<1-10,Sheldon>Okay, let's go for it.

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,710
<1-11,Stuart>两位发现了我的小宝贝
<1-11,Stuart>Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,300
<1-11,Stuart>是啊
<1-11,Stuart>Yeah.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,470
<1-12,Leonard>看着还行
<1-12,Leonard>It's okay, I guess.

26
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,200
<1-13,Sheldon>什么叫还行  它简直了不起
<1-13,Sheldon>Okay? It's magnificent.

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,110
<1-14,Leonard>多少钱
<1-14,Leonard>What do you want for it?

28
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,540
<1-15,Stuart>很难给本尊出现在付费电视上
<1-15,Stuart>Oh, it's hard to put a price on something

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,430
<1-15,Stuart>其复制品出现在本店里的东西定价
<1-15,Stuart>that's a copy of something that was on pay cable.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,710
<1-16,Leonard>你还真是狮子大开口
<1-16,Leonard>Oh, that's pretty steep.

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,830
<1-17,Stuart>这可是限量版
<1-17,Stuart>Well, it's a limited edition.

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,070
<2-6,Sheldon>威尔·惠顿的派对之前
<2-6,Sheldon>to Wil Wheaton's party,

135
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,080
<2-6,Sheldon>你是我的朋友  同时又不是我的朋友
<2-6,Sheldon>you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend.

136
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,560
<2-6,Sheldon>我把这个现象称为
<2-6,Sheldon>I'm characterizing this phenomenon

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
<2-6,Sheldon>薛定谔的友谊
<2-6,Sheldon>as Schrodinger's Friendship.

139
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,880
<2-7,Leonard>明白了  可以把水给我了吗
<2-7,Leonard>Got it. Can I have my water?

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,370
<2-7,Leonard>当然
<2-7,Leonard>Of course.

141
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,760
<2-8,Sheldon>自己捡去吧  你这个叛徒
<2-8,Sheldon>Now get it yourself, you traitor.

142
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,170
<2-9,Penny>等一下  这到底是怎么回事
<2-9,Penny>Wait, what is going on?

143
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,510
<2-10,Sheldon>忘了我就再提醒你一下
<2-10,Sheldon>In case you have forgotten,

144
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,920
<2-10,Sheldon>薛定谔的猫是个理想实验
<2-10,Sheldon>Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment...

145
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,760
<2-11,Penny>不  不  我没忘
<2-11,Penny>No, no, I didn't forget.

146
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,530
<2-11,Penny>他把一只猫装进了盒子  在你打开盒子之前
<2-11,Penny>Um, there's this cat in a box and until you open it,

147
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,010
<2-11,Penny>猫要么死  要么活  要么半死半活
<2-11,Penny>it's either dead or alive or both.

148
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,000
<2-11,Penny>尽管在我内布拉斯卡州的老家
<2-11,Penny>Although, back in Nebraska,

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,170
<2-11,Penny>我们家的猫钻进了我哥露营用的行李箱里
<2-11,Penny>our cat got stuck in my brother's camp trunk,

150
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,400
<2-11,Penny>我们不用打开就知道
<2-11,Penny>and we did not need to open it

151
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,880
<2-11,Penny>里面肯定装满了各式各样的死猫
<2-11,Penny>to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.

152
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,610
<2-12,Amy>会讲家常小故事  懂点物理
<2-12,Amy>Homespun stories, knowledge of physics

153
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,820
<2-12,Amy>同时还具有傲人的双峰
<2-12,Amy>and a bosom that defies it.

154
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,010
<2-12,Amy>你还真是全才啊
<2-12,Amy>You're the whole package, aren't you?

155
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,180
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>抱歉  我来晚了
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>Sorry I'm late.

156
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,290
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>我有好消息要宣布
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>Uh, I got great news.

157
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,500
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>NASA[国家航空航天局]选中了我们小组
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>NASA picked my team's design

158
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,380
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>设计的深空太空望远镜
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>for the deep field space telescope

159
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,360
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>今春天就要把这个设计用在国际空间站上了
<2-13,Howard (arriving)>that's going on the International Space Station this spring.

160
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,150
<2-15,Bernadette>华仔  这太棒了
<2-15,Bernadette>Howie, that's wonderful!

161
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,380
<2-15,Bernadette>恭喜你
<2-15,Bernadette>Congratulations!

162
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,240
<2-16,Howard>精彩的还在后头呢
<2-16,Howard>It gets better.

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,570
<2-16,Howard>安装的时候还要派一个人
<2-16,Howard>Someone has to go up with the telescope

164
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,930
<2-16,Howard>作为装备专家上太空
<2-16,Howard>as a payload specialist,

165
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,410
<2-16,Howard>猜猜他们选中谁了
<2-16,Howard>and guess who that someone is.

166
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,430
<2-16,Howard>穆罕默德·李
<2-16,Howard>Muhammad Li.

167
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,290
<2-16,Howard>穆罕默德·李是谁
<2-16,Howard>Who's Muhammad Li?

168
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,890
<2-19,Sheldon>穆罕默德是全球最普遍的名
<2-19,Sheldon>Muhammad is the most common first name in the world,

169
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,760
<2-19,Sheldon>而李则是最普遍的姓氏
<2-19,Sheldon>Li, the most common surname.

170
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,850
<2-19,Sheldon>因为我不知道答案
<2-19,Sheldon>As I didn't know the answer,

171
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,460
<2-19,Sheldon>但我觉得这么猜  在数学上比较靠谱
<2-19,Sheldon>I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.

172
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,820
<2-20,Howard>他们选中我  谢尔顿
<2-20,Howard>It's me, Sheldon.

173
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,330
<2-20,Howard>是我
<2-20,Howard>It's me.

174
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,640
<2-20,Howard>我要上太空了
<2-20,Howard>I'm going up in space!

175
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,420
<2-20,Howard>严格来说  我是宇航员了
<2-20,Howard>Technically, I'm an astronaut.

176
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,740
<2-21,All>帅呆了
<2-21,All>That's amazing!

177
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,050
<2-22,Bernadette>等会儿
<2-22,Bernadette>Hang on a second.

178
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,940
<2-22,Bernadette>NASA已经没有航天飞机了
<2-22,Bernadette>NASA doesn't have a shuttle anymore.

179
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,020
<2-22,Bernadette>你怎么上太空呀
<2-22,Bernadette>How are you going to get up there?

180
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,120
<2-23,Howard>这个过程就酷了
<2-23,Howard>Oh, well, it's really cool.

181
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,470
<2-23,Howard>你先飞到莫斯科  然后他们带你去哈萨克斯坦
<2-23,Howard>You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan,

182
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,600
<2-23,Howard>然后你再登上一个俄罗斯联盟号火箭
<2-23,Howard>and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket

183
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,560
<2-23,Howard>直接冲上低空地球轨道
<2-23,Howard>which shoots you into a low earth orbit.

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,980
<2-23,Howard>又或是你只能呆坐在火箭发射台上
<2-23,Howard>Or just sits there on the launch pad

185
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,110
<2-23,Howard>因为哈萨克黑手党
<2-23,Howard>because the Kazakhi mafia

186
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,550
<2-23,Howard>把火箭燃料都拿到黑市上去卖了
<2-23,Howard>sold the rocket fuel on the black market.

187
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,920
<2-24,Bernadette>这些俄罗斯火箭安全吗
<2-24,Bernadette>Are those Russian rockets safe?

188
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,760
<2-25,Howard>切尔诺贝利事件也是这帮俄罗斯人弄出来的
<2-25,Howard>Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built

189
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,170
<2-25,Howard>安全性可见一斑吧
<2-25,Howard>by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.

190
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,540
<2-26,Leonard>我们大家来敬他一杯吧
<2-26,Leonard>I'd like to propose a toast.

191
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,570
<2-26,Leonard>我们在座的各位  都有登上太空的梦想
<2-26,Leonard>The dream to go up into space is one we all share,

192
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,680
<2-26,Leonard>而今天霍华德  实现了这个梦想
<2-26,Leonard>and Howard's making that a reality.

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
<2-26,Leonard>我们都以你为傲
<2-26,Leonard>We're all very proud of you.

194
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,730
<2-27,All>干杯
<2-27,All>Cheers.

195
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,200
<2-28,Sheldon>敬酒词说的不错呀
<2-28,Sheldon>That was a lovely toast.

196
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,290
<2-29,Leonard>-口头表扬一次  -谢谢
<2-29,Leonard>- Kudos.  - Thank you.

197
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,400
<2-30,Sheldon>与此同时  你的敬酒词也老套得让人反胃
<2-30,Sheldon>Simultaneously, a festival of cloying cliche.

198
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,090
<2-30,Sheldon>你恶心死我了
<2-30,Sheldon>You sicken me.

199
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,070
<3-1,Howard>你怎么这么安静
<3-1,Howard>You're really quiet.

200
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,460
<3-1,Howard>没事吧
<3-1,Howard>Is everything okay?

201
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,980
<3-2,Bernadette>没事
<3-2,Bernadette>Fine.

202
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,290
<3-2,Bernadette>只是有点累了
<3-2,Bernadette>Just a little tired.

203
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,340
<3-3,Howard>希望你别太累  因为我现在可是
<3-3,Howard>I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling

204
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,100
<3-3,Howard>"阳刚"十足哦
<3-3,Howard>particularly masculine right now.

205
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,980
<3-3,Howard>蓄势待发  你明白我意思吧
<3-3,Howard>All systems go, if you catch my drift.

206
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,540
<3-4,Bernadette>我一向明白你意思
<3-4,Bernadette>I always catch your drift.

207
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,490
<3-5,Howard>好吧  你很明显是有心事
<3-5,Howard>All right, well, something's obviously bugging you.

208
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,180
<3-5,Howard>到底怎么了
<3-5,Howard>What is it?

209
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,280
<3-6,Bernadette>我只是不敢相信你居然
<3-6,Bernadette>I just can't believe you signed up

210
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,270
<3-6,Bernadette>都不跟我商量就决定上太空了
<3-6,Bernadette>for the space program without even talking to me.

211
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,420
<3-7,Howard>我明白了
<3-7,Howard>Oh, I get it.

212
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,980
<3-7,Howard>你是在担心我
<3-7,Howard>You're worried about me.

213
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,170
<3-7,Howard>你真是贴心啊  宝贝儿
<3-7,Howard>That is so sweet.

214
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,270
<3-7,Howard>在我们NASA有一句老话
<3-7,Howard>You know, there's a saying we have at NASA.

215
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,690
<3-7,Howard>太空英雄之所以成为英雄
<3-7,Howard>What makes the right stuff so right

216
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,750
<3-7,Howard>是因为他们能平安归来
<3-7,Howard>is that it always comes home.

217
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,590
<3-8,Bernadette>你就闭嘴吧  霍华德
<3-8,Bernadette>Just stop talking, Howard.

218
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,800
<3-9,Howard>我跟你说我要成为宇航员时
<3-9,Howard>This isn't the reaction I expected

219
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,800
<3-9,Howard>我可没想到你会是这么个反应
<3-9,Howard>when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.

220
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,760
<3-10,Bernadette>那你以为我会是什么反应
<3-10,Bernadette>What did you think was going to happen?

221
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,290
<3-11,Howard>实话吗  当然是滚床单
<3-11,Howard>Honestly? Sex.

222
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,930
<3-12,Bernadette>霍华德
<3-12,Bernadette>Howard.

223
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,290
<3-13,Howard>你知道这是多大的事吗
<3-13,Howard>Do you realize what a big deal this is?

224
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,430
<3-13,Howard>你知道被选中上太空是何等的荣誉吗
<3-13,Howard>What an honor it is to be chosen to go into space?

225
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,420
<3-14,Bernadette>我明白
<3-14,Bernadette>Yeah, I get it.

226
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,300
<3-14,Bernadette>我只是希望你做决定之前能跟我商量一下
<3-14,Bernadette>I just wish you included me in the decision.

227
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,160
<3-14,Bernadette>咱俩应该是人生搭档
<3-14,Bernadette>We're supposed to be partners.

228
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,270
<3-14,Bernadette>应该是站在同一战线的
<3-14,Bernadette>We're supposed to be a team.

229
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,450
<3-14,Bernadette>对不起  你说的没错
<3-14,Bernadette>I'm sorry. You're right.

230
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,300
<3-15,Howard>好吧  咱重头来一次
<3-15,Howard>Okay, let's try this again.

231
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,640
<3-15,Howard>伯纳黛特  我现在遇到一个千载难逢的机遇
<3-15,Howard>Bernadette, an opportunity has come up

232
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,200
<3-15,Howard>事关咱俩  所以我想跟你商量一下
<3-15,Howard>that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.

233
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,180
<3-16,Bernadette>好吧
<3-16,Bernadette>Okay.

234
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,470
<3-17,Howard>我被NASA选中
<3-17,Howard>I've been offered a chance to go up

235
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,750
<3-17,Howard>要去国际空间站待上三个星期
<3-17,Howard>to the International Space Station for three weeks.

236
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,220
<3-17,Howard>你怎么想
<3-17,Howard>What are your thoughts on that?

237
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,310
<3-18,Bernadette>首先  我想谢谢你
<3-18,Bernadette>Well, first of all, thank you

238
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,000
<3-18,Bernadette>在做决定之前想到要跟我商量
<3-18,Bernadette>for including me in the decision-making process.

239
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,720
<3-19,Howard>那是当然  咱俩可是一个阵营的
<3-19,Howard>Hey, we're a team.

240
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,990
<3-19,Howard>那说说你的想法吧
<3-19,Howard>So, what do you think?

241
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,810
<4-10,Amy>不行
<4-10,Amy>No.

242
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,460
<4-11,Sheldon>不行
<4-11,Sheldon>No?

243
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,090
<4-12,Penny>不行
<4-12,Penny>No.

244
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,400
<3-23,Howard>为什么不行
<3-23,Howard>Why not?

245
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,630
<3-24,Bernadette>霍华德  我父亲是个警察
<3-24,Bernadette>Howard, my father was a police officer.

246
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,390
<3-24,Bernadette>我们家人每天都提心吊胆的
<3-24,Bernadette>We never knew from one night to the next

247
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,540
<3-24,Bernadette>不知道他晚上能不能活着回到家
<3-24,Bernadette>if he was going to come home alive.

248
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,830
<3-24,Bernadette>那感觉糟透了
<3-24,Bernadette>It was horrible.

249
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,130
<3-24,Bernadette>我不希望跟你以后的生活也是这个样子
<3-24,Bernadette>And I don't want to live that way with you.

250
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,990
<3-25,Howard>我十一岁的时候
<3-25,Howard>Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother

251
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,840
<3-25,Howard>我爸就抛弃了我和我妈
<3-25,Howard>when I was 11.

252
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
<3-25,Howard>我们从那以后再没见过他
<3-25,Howard>We never saw him again.

253
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,780
<3-26,Bernadette>说啥都没用  反正我就是不许你上太空
<3-26,Bernadette>Oh, boo-hoo, you're not going to space!

254
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,230
<4-1,Leonard>霍华德还挺有能耐的  对吧
<4-1,Leonard>Pretty cool about Howard, huh?

255
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,160
<4-2,Sheldon>别装作咱俩之间好像没事一样
<4-2,Sheldon>Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us.

256
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,410
<4-2,Sheldon>不过没错  他是挺有能耐的  兄弟
<4-2,Sheldon>And yes, it sure is, buddy.

257
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,450
<4-3,Leonard>老天啊  你能不能别再玩薛定谔那一套了
<4-3,Leonard>For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.

258
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,270
<4-4,Sheldon>你想要像海森堡不确定性原理
<4-4,Sheldon>Would you prefer a simpler application

260
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,940
<4-4,Sheldon>那样更简单的程序吗
<4-4,Sheldon>of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,

261
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,820
<4-4,Sheldon>我现在不能同时确定
<4-4,Sheldon>in which I could either

262
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,940
<4-4,Sheldon>你到底是哪方的或我是否喜欢你
<4-4,Sheldon>know where you are or whether I like you,

263
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,780
<4-4,Sheldon>不过现在两者都不确定
<4-4,Sheldon>but not both.

264
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,630
<4-5,Leonard>你是从不知道住嘴的  是吧
<4-5,Leonard>You never stop talking, do you?

265
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,360
<4-6,Amy>我不明白
<4-6,Amy>I don't understand.

266
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,150
<4-6,Amy>莱纳德去不去威尔·惠顿的派对
<4-6,Amy>What differences does it make

267
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,900
<4-6,Amy>有什么区别
<4-6,Amy>if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party?

268
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,640
<4-7,Penny>威尔·惠顿是谢尔顿的死敌
<4-7,Penny>Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy.

269
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,140
<4-8,Amy>死敌
<4-8,Amy>Mortal enemy?

270
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,150
<4-10,Amy>谢尔顿  我知道你是个
<4-10,Amy>Sheldon, I know you're a bit

271
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,400
<4-10,Amy>十分别扭的人  但是
<4-10,Amy>of a left-handed monkey wrench, but...

272
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,650
<4-10,Amy>你真的有个死敌吗
<4-10,Amy>you really have a mortal enemy?

273
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,220
<4-11,Sheldon>其实我有61个
<4-11,Sheldon>In fact, I have 61 of them.

274
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,540
<4-11,Sheldon>你想看看我的黑名单吗
<4-11,Sheldon>Would you like to see the list?

275
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,080
<4-12,Penny>说不要  说不要  说不要
<4-12,Penny>Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.

276
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,470
<4-13,Sheldon>刚刚才把你从名单上剔除
<4-13,Sheldon>You just got off the list.

277
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,430
<4-13,Sheldon>是不是又想回去了
<4-13,Sheldon>Would you like back on it?

278
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,100
<4-13,Sheldon>这要稍等一下
<4-13,Sheldon>This'll just take a moment.

279
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,090
<4-13,Sheldon>名单存在一张5.25英寸软盘里
<4-13,Sheldon>It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.

280
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,750
<4-14,Amy>你还用软盘啊
<4-14,Amy>A floppy disk?

281
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,260
<4-15,Sheldon>我九岁就开始列这个名单了
<4-15,Sheldon>Well, I started the list when I was nine.

282
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,760
<4-16,Amy>威尔·惠顿为啥被列入名单了
<4-16,Amy>How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?

283
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,010
<4-17,All>-老天  -别问啊
<4-17,All>- Oh, God! - Oh! Come on!

284
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,840
<4-18,Sheldon>我小的时候非常喜欢卫斯理·柯洛夏
<4-18,Sheldon>As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher,

285
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,780
<4-18,Sheldon>即威尔·惠顿在《星际迷航》里的角色
<4-18,Sheldon>Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek.

286
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,480
<4-18,Sheldon>我坐了几小时巴士  去参加一个星际迷航大会
<4-18,Sheldon>So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention

287
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,570
<4-18,Sheldon>威尔·惠顿本来是要出席的
<4-18,Sheldon>at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear,

288
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,690
<4-18,Sheldon>我要找他给我的卫斯理·柯洛夏玩具签名
<4-18,Sheldon>so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed.

289
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,390
<4-18,Sheldon>可他压根就没出现
<4-18,Sheldon>But he never showed, because

290
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,700
<4-18,Sheldon>因为他去玩"好莱坞框框"了
<4-18,Sheldon>apparently, it was cooler for him

292
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,390
<4-18,Sheldon>他觉得坐左下角那框框里更酷
<4-18,Sheldon>to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares.

294
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,630
<4-18,Sheldon>该死
<4-18,Sheldon>Oh, damn!

295
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,300
<4-18,Sheldon>软盘挂了
<4-18,Sheldon>The floppy failed.

296
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,870
<4-18,Sheldon>好吧  不管是谁在1989年
<4-18,Sheldon>Well, whoever was in charge of quality control

297
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,970
<4-18,Sheldon>负责威宝公司的质量控制
<4-18,Sheldon>at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989,

298
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,880
<4-18,Sheldon>恭喜他  他进了我的黑名单
<4-18,Sheldon>congratulations, you just made the list.

299
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,820
<5-1,Bernadette>霍华德
<5-1,Bernadette>Howard?

300
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,610
<5-2,Howard>改变主意要滚床单了吗
<5-2,Howard>Change your mind about sex?

301
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,600
<5-2,Howard>虽然还生气  但我会委曲求全
<5-2,Howard>I'm still mad, but I'll do it.

302
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,850
<5-3,Bernadette>不是  我刚刚一直在想
<5-3,Bernadette>No, I've just been thinking.

303
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,560
<5-3,Bernadette>我担心你的安危并不重要
<5-3,Bernadette>It doesn't matter if I'm afraid for your safety.

304
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,540
<5-3,Bernadette>重要的是  我不想成为那个
<5-3,Bernadette>I don't want to be the person

305
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,420
<5-3,Bernadette>阻碍你追逐梦想的人
<5-3,Bernadette>who stands between you and your dreams.

306
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,670
<5-4,Howard>真的吗
<5-4,Howard>Really?

307
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,790
<5-4,Howard>真的
<5-4,Howard>Really.

308
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,630
<5-5,Bernadette>如果去太空真的对你很重要
<5-5,Bernadette>If going into space means that much to you,

309
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,180
<5-5,Bernadette>我不会再说一句反对的话
<5-5,Bernadette>I will never say another word about it.

310
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,900
<5-6,Howard>谢谢
<5-6,Howard>Thank you.

311
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,270
<5-7,Bernadette>我爱你
<5-7,Bernadette>I love you.

312
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,840
<5-8,Howard>我也爱你
<5-8,Howard>I love you, too.

313
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,100
<5-8,Howard>那现在开滚[床单]了吗
<5-8,Howard>So, sex now?

314
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,930
<5-8,Howard>好
<5-8,Howard>Okay.

315
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,990
<5-9,Bernadette>不过我刚忘了刷牙
<5-9,Bernadette>I just forgot to brush my teeth.

316
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,630
<5-9,Bernadette>我马上回来
<5-9,Bernadette>I'll be right back.

317
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,120
<4-16,Amy>*哦  宝贝 *
<4-16,Amy>* Oh, baby

318
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,440
<4-17,All>*我...*
<4-17,All>* I'm

319
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,270
<5-9,Bernadette>*我爱的不是你 *
<5-9,Bernadette>* I'm not in love with you...

320
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,370
<5-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>除非我死  否则我儿子休想去太空
<5-10,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!

321
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,030
<5-11,Bernadette>我准备好了
<5-11,Bernadette>I'm ready.

322
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,750
<6-1,Leonard>等等  先看看我理解得对不对
<6-1,Leonard>Wait, let me see if I got this right.

323
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,970
<6-1,Leonard>你真的半夜
<6-1,Leonard>You actually asked Bernadette

324
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,350
<6-1,Leonard>把伯纳黛特赶出了家门?
<6-1,Leonard>to leave your house in the middle of the night?

325
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,240
<6-2,Howard>我有得选吗
<6-2,Howard>What choice did I have?

326
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,520
<6-2,Howard>她背着我
<6-2,Howard>She went behind my back

327
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,700
<6-2,Howard>告发我妈来反我
<6-2,Howard>and turned my own mother against me.

328
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,200
<6-3,Raj>哇  你不仅是我们中的第一个宇航员
<6-3,Raj>Wow. You're not only our first astronaut.

329
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,980
<6-3,Raj>还是我们中第一个把女孩子赶下床的人
<6-3,Raj>You're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed.

330
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,980
<6-3,Raj>你简直就是个巨星啊
<6-3,Raj>You're like a rock star.

331
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,810
<6-4,Howard>有点吧
<6-4,Howard>Little bit.

332
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,670
<6-5,Leonard>我不想这么说  但她确实背叛了你
<6-5,Leonard>I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.

333
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,880
<6-6,Sheldon>真有意思
<6-6,Sheldon>Interesting.

334
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,610
<6-6,Sheldon>你能看出别人的背叛行为  却看不出你自己的
<6-6,Sheldon>You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.

335
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,690
<6-7,Leonard>去惠顿的派对不是背叛你
<6-7,Leonard>Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.

336
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,600
<6-8,Sheldon>你当然会这么认为
<6-8,Sheldon>Oh, of course you would have to believe that.

337
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,560
<6-8,Sheldon>邪恶的人永远认为自己是对的
<6-8,Sheldon>Evil always thinks it's doing right.

338
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,290
<6-8,Sheldon>"喂  突击兵"
<6-8,Sheldon>"Excuse me, Stormtrooper. "

340
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,020
<6-8,Sheldon>"这些才是你要找的机器人"
<6-8,Sheldon>"These are the droids you're looking for."

341
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,170
<6-9,Leonard>我是去参加派对
<6-9,Leonard>I'm going to a party.

342
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,480
<6-9,Leonard>又不是叫R2-D2和C-3PO机器人反帝国
<6-9,Leonard>I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!

343
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,790
<6-10,Sheldon>时候未到而已
<6-10,Sheldon>Not yet.

344
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,140
<6-11,Raj>那接下来怎样
<6-11,Raj>So, what's gonna happen next?

345
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,200
<6-11,Raj>你和伯纳黛特会分手吗
<6-11,Raj>Are you and Bernadette going to break up?

346
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,790
<6-11,Raj>我不知道
<6-11,Raj>I don't know.

347
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,960
<6-12,Howard>就算我们要复合
<6-12,Howard>If we're going to get back together,

348
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,500
<6-12,Howard>她也要先道歉  并且接受
<6-12,Howard>she's going to have to apologize and accept  that

349
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,360
<6-12,Howard>我是个大男人  我能自己拿主意
<6-12,Howard>I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions.

350
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,040
<6-13,Raj>然后她还要说服你妈  让你去太空
<6-13,Raj>Then she's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.

351
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,720
<6-14,Howard>必须的
<6-14,Howard>Obviously.

352
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,340
<7-1,Bernadette>我没有别的办法
<7-1,Bernadette>I had no choice.

353
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,130
<7-1,Bernadette>我必须告诉他妈
<7-1,Bernadette>I had to tell his mother.

354
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,750
<7-1,Bernadette>他不能去太空
<7-1,Bernadette>He can't go to space.

355
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,180
<7-1,Bernadette>他还是只小雏鸟呢
<7-1,Bernadette>He's like a baby bird.

356
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,150
<7-1,Bernadette>你知道他有一次
<7-1,Bernadette>Do you know he once got an asthma attack

357
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,030
<7-1,Bernadette>因为看图书馆的旧书引发哮喘吗
<7-1,Bernadette>from reading an old library book?

358
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,200
<7-2,Amy>开玩笑的吧
<7-2,Amy>You're kidding.

359
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,940
<7-3,Penny>真的  我那天还在场呢
<7-3,Penny>No, I was there that day.

360
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,560
<7-3,Penny>谢尔顿递那本书给他时  还闪到腰了
<7-3,Penny>Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.

361
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,040
<7-4,Bernadette>我不知道自己该怎么办
<7-4,Bernadette>I don't know what I'm going to do.

362
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,890
<7-4,Bernadette>我不想因此和他分手
<7-4,Bernadette>I don't want to break up over this.

363
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,340
<7-5,Penny>好吧  那你直接跟他说你错了
<7-5,Penny>Okay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?

364
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,130
<7-6,Bernadette>你们觉得我做错了吗
<7-6,Bernadette>Do you guys think it was a mistake?

365
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,490
<7-6,Bernadette>我这样是不是太小人了
<7-6,Bernadette>Am I the bad guy in this?

366
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,060
<7-7,Amy>这事轮不到我们来评论
<7-7,Amy>It's not for us to judge.

367
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,970
<7-7,Amy>我们只是来支持你  安慰你
<7-7,Amy>We're just here to provide comfort and support

368
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,460
<7-7,Amy>你要自己面对你的小人之举
<7-7,Amy>while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you've done.

369
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,810
<7-7,Amy>天啊  你说得对
<7-7,Amy>Oh, God, you're right.

370
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,230
<7-8,Bernadette>我把我们的爱扔到了他那肥婆老妈脚下
<7-8,Bernadette>I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother.

371
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,440
<7-8,Bernadette>我得去道歉
<7-8,Bernadette>I need to apologize.

372
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,190
<7-9,Penny>那也对  我很高兴你想通了
