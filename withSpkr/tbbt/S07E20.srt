1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,500
<1-1,Leonard>我不得不说  我越读有关
<1-1,Leonard>I gotta tell you, the more I read about the

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,680
<1-1,Leonard>原始重力波的发现  我就越兴奋
<1-1,Leonard>primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,700
<1-2,Raj>是啊  现在当个天体物理学家
<1-2,Raj>I know. Being an astrophysicist right now

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,120
<1-2,Raj>就跟当个摇滚巨星似的
<1-2,Raj>is like being a rock star.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,920
<1-3,Howard>除了没歌迷送炮之外
<1-3,Howard>Only without the sex.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,500
<1-4,Raj>是啊  真是一炮难求
<1-4,Raj>Yeah, literally, none of it.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,520
<1-5,Leonard>谢尔顿  你觉得呢
<1-5,Leonard>What do you think about it, Sheldon?

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,920
<1-6,Sheldon>切
<1-6,Sheldon>Meh.

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,520
<1-7,Raj>你不是吧  这可能是
<1-7,Raj>Are you kidding me? This may be

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,380
<1-7,Raj>我们有生之年所能碰见最大的科研突破
<1-7,Raj>the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,430
<1-7,Raj>而你做为个理论物理学家
<1-7,Raj>How can you, as a theoretical physicist,

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,930
<1-7,Raj>居然一点都不关心
<1-7,Raj>not care about this?

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,120
<1-8,Sheldon>可能我不是个精英主义者
<1-8,Sheldon>Maybe it's because I'm not an elitist.

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,490
<1-8,Sheldon>我更想知道的是
<1-8,Sheldon>What I'd like to know is:

15
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,420
<1-8,Sheldon>这个重力波的突破
<1-8,Sheldon>How does this gravity wave breakthrough

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,270
<1-8,Sheldon>能对一般人有何帮助
<1-8,Sheldon>help the man on the street? You know?

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,140
<1-8,Sheldon>普通路人傻逼对量子物理学的担心
<1-8,Sheldon>Wh-Who's looking out for Joe Six-Pack

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,620
<1-8,Sheldon>又有谁关心呢
<1-8,Sheldon>and all his quantum physics concerns?

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,720
<1-9,Leonard>天啊  你在嫉妒人家
<1-9,Leonard>Oh, my God, you're jealous.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,390
<1-10,Sheldon>-我为何要嫉妒  -不知道啊
<1-10,Sheldon>- Why would I be jealous? - Oh, I don't know.

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,270
<1-11,Leonard>可能宇宙的起源被别人证明了
<1-11,Leonard>Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven,

22
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,800
<1-11,Leonard>希格斯力场也被别人证明了
<1-11,Leonard>the Higgs field just got proven

23
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,350
<1-11,Leonard>而你这20年来对弦理论的研究
<1-11,Leonard>and you've been working on string theory

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,720
<1-11,Leonard>与你刚开始的那会相比
<1-11,Leonard>for the last 20 years and you're no closer to proving it

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,430
<1-11,Leonard>一点进展都没有
<1-11,Leonard>than when you started.

26
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,520
<1-12,Sheldon>是啊  我有太多事情要忙
<1-12,Sheldon>Yeah, well, I've had a lot on my plate.

27
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,090
<1-12,Sheldon>我们刚好活在电视界的黄金时期
<1-12,Sheldon>We happen to live in a golden age of television.

28
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,930
<1-12,Sheldon>各位  打扰一下
<1-12,Sheldon>Excuse me, fellas.

29
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,180
<1-13,Barry>抱歉我偷听了你们的谈话
<1-13,Barry>Sorry for eavesdropping,

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,480
<1-13,Barry>但其实今天在强子对撞机那里
<1-13,Barry>but there actually was some big string theory news today

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,980
<1-13,Barry>-有一条弦理论的大新闻呢  -真的吗
<1-13,Barry>- out of the Hadron Collider. - Really?

32
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,080
<1-14,Sheldon>他们发现支持额外维度的证明
<1-14,Sheldon>Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,620
<1-14,Sheldon>-还是超对称性吗  -都不是
<1-14,Sheldon>- or supersymmetry? - No,

34
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,010
<1-15,Barry>但他们发现了  你什么话都信的证明
<1-15,Barry>but they did find evidence that you'll believe anything.

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,750
<1-16,Sheldon>你为何要这样
<1-16,Sheldon>Why would you do that?

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,670
<1-16,Sheldon>你也是个弦理论学家啊
<1-16,Sheldon>You're a string theorist as well.

37
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,890
<1-16,Sheldon>错了  我是弦理论实用家
<1-16,Sheldon>Incorrect. I am a string pragmatist.

38
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,180
<1-17,Barry>我跟人说我要证明一个不能被证明的理论
<1-17,Barry>I say I'm gonna prove something that cannot be proved,

39
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,350
<1-17,Barry>然后申请研究款项
<1-17,Barry>I apply for grant money,

40
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,900
<1-17,Barry>最后拿这笔钱去喝酒泡妞
<1-17,Barry>and then I spend it on liquor and broads.

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,990
<1-17,Barry>再会
<1-17,Barry>Later.

42
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,430
<1-18,Sheldon>你们觉得他说的对吗
<1-18,Sheldon>Do you think he's right?

43
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,210
<1-18,Sheldon>我把生命浪费在了一个不能被证明的理论上
<1-18,Sheldon>Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?

44
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,340
<1-19,Howard>或许吧  可是《权力的游戏》多好看啊
<1-19,Howard>Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?

<1-19,Howard>禁止用作任何商业盈利行为

56
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,230
<2-1,Penny>这么早就醒啦
<2-1,Penny>Hey, you're up early.

57
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,120
<2-2,Sheldon>我睡不着
<2-2,Sheldon>I couldn't sleep.

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,780
<2-3,Penny>我早说了别用《行尸走肉》的枕头套
<2-3,Penny>I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.

59
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,860
<2-4,Sheldon>跟那个无关
<2-4,Sheldon>No, that's not it.

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,540
<2-5,Penny>有烦心事吗
<2-5,Penny>Is something bothering you?

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,340
<2-6,Sheldon>是啊  不过你不会懂的
<2-6,Sheldon>Yes, but you wouldn't understand.

62
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,690
<2-7,Penny>别这样  说来听听
<2-7,Penny>Oh, come on, try me.

63
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,410
<2-7,Penny>好吧
<2-7,Penny>All right.

64
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,540
<2-8,Sheldon>我把我的人生黄金时期都奉献给了弦理论
<2-8,Sheldon>I've devoted the prime of my life to string theory

65
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,060
<2-8,Sheldon>致力于探索紧化额外维度
<2-8,Sheldon>and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions.

66
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,410
<2-8,Sheldon>而我连一点可以炫耀的成功都没有  像个傻瓜
<2-8,Sheldon>I've got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.

67
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,200
<2-8,Sheldon>好  我懂了
<2-8,Sheldon>Okay. I get it.

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,020
<2-9,Penny>虽然中间的鬼话一个字没懂  但是...
<2-9,Penny>I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but...

69
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,440
<2-9,Penny>我懂那种
<2-9,Penny>I know what it's like

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,800
<2-9,Penny>全心全意都奉献给某个人事物
<2-9,Penny>to put your heart and soul into something

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,270
<2-9,Penny>却一点回报都没有的感觉
<2-9,Penny>and get nothing out of it.

72
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,570
<2-10,Sheldon>你是说你的演艺事业吗
<2-10,Sheldon>You mean your acting career?

73
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,440
<2-11,Penny>不是
<2-11,Penny>No.

74
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,430
<2-12,Sheldon>你与莱纳德的感情吗
<2-12,Sheldon>Your relationship with Leonard?

75
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,080
<2-11,Penny>也不是
<2-11,Penny>No.

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,390
<2-14,Sheldon>你重回校园的失败之路吗
<2-14,Sheldon>Your failed attempt to go back to college?

77
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,710
<2-11,Penny>不是
<2-11,Penny>No!

78
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,340
<2-15,Penny>我是说你与弦理论就像一段感情
<2-15,Penny>I'm saying you and string theory sound like a relationship,

79
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,630
<2-15,Penny>而我知道那种感情的滋味
<2-15,Penny>and I know what it's like to be in one

80
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,440
<2-15,Penny>也懂那种永远不能如愿的感觉
<2-15,Penny>and realize it's never gonna turn out the way you want.

81
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,210
<2-16,Sheldon>都说是莱纳德  你还否认
<2-16,Sheldon>I said Leonard; you said no.

82
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,900
<2-17,Penny>我是指跟其他男人时啦
<2-17,Penny>I'm talking about other guys.

83
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,220
<2-17,Penny>好吧
<2-17,Penny>Okay.

84
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,910
<2-18,Sheldon>那你都是怎么做的
<2-18,Sheldon>Well, what do you do?

85
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,220
<2-19,Penny>你得有壮士断腕的勇气结束感情
<2-19,Penny>You have to have the courage to end the relationship.

86
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,550
<2-19,Penny>分手止损  握手道别  甩手走人
<2-19,Penny>You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.

87
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,870
<2-20,Sheldon>我不知道我能不能做到
<2-20,Sheldon>I don't know if I can do that.

88
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,950
<2-21,Penny>我知道这很困难  但宝贝
<2-21,Penny>I know it's hard, honey,

89
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,530
<2-21,Penny>但人都是这样成长的
<2-21,Penny>but in the end, that's how you grow.

90
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,100
<2-22,Leonard>佩妮  你有看到我好的那个吸入器吗
<2-22,Leonard>Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?

91
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,270
<2-23,Sheldon>分手止损  握手道别  甩手走人
<2-23,Sheldon>Break it off, shake hands, walk away.

92
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,950
<3-1,Leonard>跟两个女人纠缠得如何啊
<3-1,Leonard>Hey, how's dating two women going?

93
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,250
<3-2,Raj>遇到点小麻烦
<3-2,Raj>Um, kind of hit a bump.

94
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,980
<3-2,Raj>当我老实告诉艾米丽
<3-2,Raj>When I was honest and told Emily

95
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,480
<3-2,Raj>我同时有在与另一个人约会时  她可以接受
<3-2,Raj>she wasn't the only person I was seeing, it went great.

96
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,480
<3-2,Raj>所以我也这么告诉了露西
<3-2,Raj>So I tried the same thing with Lucy.

97
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,850
<3-3,Howard>然后呢
<3-3,Howard>And?

98
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,100
<3-4,Raj>她内心五味杂陈
<3-4,Raj>She had mixed feelings.

99
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,970
<3-4,Raj>但当我说"艾米丽可以接受
<3-4,Raj>But when I said, "Emily was cool with it.

100
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,540
<3-4,Raj>艾米丽最好了  你为啥不学学艾米丽"时
<3-4,Raj>Emily's the best. Why can't you be more like Emily?"...

101
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,390
<3-4,Raj>那五味就只剩一味了
<3-4,Raj>...those feelings became less mixed.

102
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,910
<3-5,Leonard>女人啊  谁知道她们不爽的点在哪
<3-5,Leonard>Women. Who knows what'll set 'em off?

103
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,570
<3-6,Raj>可至少我现在能全心对一个女孩投入了
<3-6,Raj>At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.

104
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,600
<3-7,Howard>我希望我能尽快见到她
<3-7,Howard>I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.

105
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,470
<3-8,Raj>干嘛这么着急  她又不会跑
<3-8,Raj>Why the rush? She isn't going anywhere.

106
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,940
<3-9,Howard>她会的  但我喜欢你的乐观
<3-9,Howard>She is. But I like that attitude.

107
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,790
<3-10,Sheldon>各位  有人对我弦理论的旧书感兴趣吗
<3-10,Sheldon>Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?

108
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,210
<3-11,Raj>你真的要这么做吗
<3-11,Raj>You're really going to do this?

109
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,010
<3-12,Sheldon>是的  佩妮指出
<3-12,Sheldon>I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that

110
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,250
<3-12,Sheldon>我现在基本上就是在经历一段分手
<3-12,Sheldon>what I'm going through is essentially a breakup.

111
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,270
<3-12,Sheldon>而且根据《时尚》杂志中
<3-12,Sheldon>And according to Cosmopolitan magazine,

112
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,630
<3-12,Sheldon>一篇教导如何有效挥别旧爱的文章
<3-12,Sheldon>one of the most effective techniques for moving on

113
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,520
<3-12,Sheldon>分手就得丢掉会回忆起感情的一切物件
<3-12,Sheldon>is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.

114
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,560
<3-13,Howard>-你还读起《时尚》杂志啦  -是啊
<3-13,Howard>- You're reading Cosmo? - Yes.

115
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,930
<3-14,Sheldon>而且我还发现  基本上
<3-14,Sheldon>As it turns out, there's an article

116
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,480
<3-14,Sheldon>每期都有教导如何挥别旧爱的文章
<3-14,Sheldon>on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue.

117
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,190
<3-14,Sheldon>反正
<3-14,Sheldon>Anyway,

118
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,730
<3-14,Sheldon>它还建议要把这些东西烧掉
<3-14,Sheldon>it suggests that I set these on fire,

119
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,600
<3-14,Sheldon>但烧书的味道
<3-14,Sheldon>but the smell of burning books

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,130
<3-14,Sheldon>会让我想起教会去德州东部野餐时的回忆
<3-14,Sheldon>reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.

122
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,200
<3-15,Howard>这是什么
<3-15,Howard>What's this?

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,690
<3-16,Sheldon>我随手画的超椭圆黎曼曲面而已
<3-16,Sheldon>That's just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.

124
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,930
<3-17,Leonard>这不是你当年博士后的基础吗
<3-17,Leonard>Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?

125
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,210
<3-17,Leonard>是啊
<3-17,Leonard>It was.

126
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,010
<3-18,Sheldon>当年我还觉得这很高大上
<3-18,Sheldon>This seemed so elegant at the time,

127
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,760
<3-18,Sheldon>但我现在意识到我当年只是个被
<3-18,Sheldon>but... now I realize I was just a simple country boy

128
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,010
<3-18,Sheldon>大城市那变量都对的理论
<3-18,Sheldon>seduced by a big city theory

129
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,820
<3-18,Sheldon>所迷惑的单纯农村小伙
<3-18,Sheldon>with variables in all the right places.

130
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,670
<3-19,Raj>-你会没事的  -我知道
<3-19,Raj>- It's going to be okay. - I know.

131
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,800
<3-20,Sheldon>尽管很困难  我还是得挥别过去了
<3-20,Sheldon>As hard as this is, I have to move on.

132
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,490
<3-20,Sheldon>我不能再一直假定着多维度实体
<3-20,Sheldon>I can't keep postulating multidimensional entities

133
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,180
<3-20,Sheldon>却什么结果也得不到
<3-20,Sheldon>and get nothing in return.

134
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,540
<3-20,Sheldon>我也是有需求的人
<3-20,Sheldon>I have needs, too.

135
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,270
<3-21,Howard>你现在还跟艾米丽在一起吗
<3-21,Howard>So, you and Emily still together?

136
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,550
<4-1,Howard>我问过伯纳黛特了  她明天有空
<4-1,Howard>I spoke to Bernadette. She's free tomorrow night.

137
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,600
<4-2,Raj>好啊  行
<4-2,Raj>Oh, okay, great.

138
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,450
<4-2,Raj>但如果我们真的要四人约会
<4-2,Raj>But if we're really gonna do a double date,

139
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,720
<4-2,Raj>我们得先定下一些跟艾米丽有关的规矩
<4-2,Raj>then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.

140
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,870
<4-3,Howard>比如最终发现她是个橡胶充气娃娃时
<4-3,Howard>Like when it turns out she's made of rubber,

141
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,320
<4-3,Howard>我啥都不许说吗
<4-3,Howard>I don't say anything?

142
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,140
<4-4,Raj>她很真实好吗
<4-4,Raj>She's very real.

143
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,500
<4-5,Howard>充气娃娃盒子上都这么写啊
<4-5,Howard>Oh, that's what it says on the box.

144
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,510
<4-5,Howard>就写在"可用洗碗机清洗"的字样旁
<4-5,Howard>Right next to "Dishwasher safe."

145
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,590
<4-5,Howard>你看
<4-5,Howard>See?

146
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,770
<4-6,Raj>我担心的就是
<4-6,Raj>This is exactly the kind of thing

147
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,400
<4-6,Raj>你在她面前说这类的话
<4-6,Raj>I'm worried about you saying in front of her.

148
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,610
<4-7,Howard>-我保证我绝对会很乖  -最好是这样
<4-7,Howard>- I promise I'll be on my best behavior. - You better be.

149
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,170
<4-8,Raj>不许开我跟我的狗很亲密的玩笑
<4-8,Raj>No jokes about how close I am with my dog.

150
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,590
<4-8,Raj>也不许说我跟我狗有多亲密的实话
<4-8,Raj>Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.

151
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,800
<4-9,Howard>我保证
<4-9,Howard>You got it.

152
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,750
<4-10,Raj>不许开我学过一年芭蕾舞的玩笑
<4-10,Raj>No jokes about the year I took ballet.

153
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,670
<4-11,Howard>你学过芭蕾舞吗
<4-11,Howard>You took ballet?

154
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,540
<4-12,Raj>天啊  你从来都不好好聆听
<4-12,Raj>God, you never listen.

155
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,360
<5-1,Leonard>你确定你要这样吗
<5-1,Leonard>Are you sure you want to do this?

156
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,920
<5-2,Sheldon>杂志中一篇文章建议
<5-2,Sheldon>The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways

157
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,340
<5-2,Sheldon>挥别旧情的方法就是新造型
<5-2,Sheldon>to get over a breakup is a new look.

158
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,980
<5-3,Leonard>那你的旧造型呢
<5-3,Leonard>What about your old look,

159
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,600
<5-3,Leonard>精心打扮过的腹语术玩偶造型
<5-3,Leonard>well-groomed ventriloquist doll?

160
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,600
<5-4,Penny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll)>-"天啊  的确是很像"  -别闹了
<5-4,Penny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll)>- "Oh, my God, I do look like that." - Stop it!

161
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
<5-6,Penny>所以你想我怎么剪
<5-6,Penny>So, how do you want me to cut it?

162
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,410
<5-7,Sheldon>比尔·盖兹加尼古拉·特斯拉的发型
<5-7,Sheldon>How about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?

163
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,270
<5-8,Leonard>就是前面商人头  后面科学家头
<5-8,Leonard>So, business in the front, science in the back.

164
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,490
<5-9,Penny>或者我就不剪了
<5-9,Penny>Or I don't cut it

165
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,990
<5-9,Penny>就搞点造型就行了
<5-9,Penny>and maybe just style it a little.

166
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,670
<5-10,Sheldon>你说了算
<5-10,Sheldon>Oh, I'm in your hands.

167
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,970
<5-10,Sheldon>你弄得好我就告诉你  《时尚》教你如何轻松度过
<5-10,Sheldon>Do a good job and I'll tell you Cosmo's ten dynamite tips

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,970
<5-10,Sheldon>经前症候群的10大绝招
<5-10,Sheldon>to enjoy your PMS.

169
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,380
<5-11,Penny>你能让他保持安静吗
<5-11,Penny>Can you keep him quiet?

170
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,270
<5-11,Penny>比如拿钥匙在他眼前晃
<5-11,Penny>Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?

171
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,340
<5-12,Leonard>这招不好用了
<5-12,Leonard>That doesn't work anymore.

172
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,830
<5-12,Leonard>他只会觉得我是要带他去看医生
<5-12,Leonard>He just thinks I'm taking him to the doctor.

173
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,060
<5-12,Leonard>所以你现在不搞弦理论了
<5-12,Leonard>So, now that you're no longer invested in string theory,

174
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,720
<5-12,Leonard>你打算研究哪方面
<5-12,Leonard>what are you gonna pursue?

175
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,070
<5-13,Sheldon>有很多超有意思的领域啊
<5-13,Sheldon>Oh, there are so many exciting areas:

176
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,430
<5-13,Sheldon>黑洞  暗物质
<5-13,Sheldon>black holes, dark matter...

177
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,070
<5-14,Penny>莱纳德那天还在跟我说暗物质呢
<5-14,Penny>Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter,

178
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,840
<5-14,Penny>但我真的不太理解
<5-14,Penny>but I didn't really understand it.

179
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,540
<5-15,Sheldon>不用难过  他自己也不懂
<5-15,Sheldon>Don't feel bad. Neither does he.

180
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,220
<5-15,Sheldon>好了
<5-15,Sheldon>Okay...

181
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,370
<5-16,Penny>你觉得如何
<5-16,Penny>what do you think?

182
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,810
<5-17,Sheldon>你看没看过特斯拉的照片啊
<5-17,Sheldon>Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?

183
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,810
<5-17,Sheldon>尼古拉·特斯拉  伟大的发明家  物理学家
<5-17,Sheldon>发型是微卷的中分头

184
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,980
<5-18,Leonard>其实很好看呢  谢尔顿
<5-18,Leonard>It actually looks good, Sheldon.

185
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,280
<5-20,Leonard>-是吧  -是啊
<5-20,Leonard>- Doesn't it? - Yeah.

186
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,140
<5-21,Sheldon>我是可以想象自己在一个科学男子团体里
<5-21,Sheldon>I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band.

187
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,980
<5-21,Sheldon>由于美貌与智慧并存  所以在男团里一个顶俩
<5-21,Sheldon>Of course, I'd be the dreamy one and the smart one.

188
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,110
<5-22,Amy>抱歉我来晚了
<5-22,Amy>Sorry I'm late.

189

<5-22,Amy>What did you do?

190
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,980
<5-23,Penny>我帮他弄了新造型  很好看吧
<5-23,Penny>I gave him a new look. It's cute, huh?

191
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,760
<5-24,Amy>是啊  很好看  这就是问题
<5-24,Amy>Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem.

192
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,750
<5-24,Amy>我可不想他走在路上被饥渴的女人们
<5-24,Amy>I don't need other girls to see him walking around

193
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,590
<5-24,Amy>扑上来按倒
<5-24,Amy>like sex on a stick.

194
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,200
<5-25,Sheldon>她说的对  我太性感了
<5-25,Sheldon>She's right. I'm too hot.

<6-2,Howard>我也是  只希望他别搞砸这段情
<6-2,Howard>Me, too. I just hope he doesn't blow it.

197
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,690
<6-3,Bernadette>你为什么这么说
<6-3,Bernadette>Why would you say that?

198
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,420
<6-4,Howard>因为他是拉杰啊  这是他的专长
<6-4,Howard>Because he's Raj-- that's his thing.

199
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,420
<6-4,Howard>贝克汉姆很会踢球  破坏王很会砸
<6-4,Howard>Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it,

200
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,860

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,230
<6-4,Howard>拉杰很会搞砸

<6-4,Howard>我也不想发生那种事
<6-4,Howard>Look, I don't want it to happen,

203
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,620
<6-4,Howard>但他有很大的几率会搞...
<6-4,Howard>but odds are he's gonna find a way to...

204
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,880
<6-4,Howard>靠  我认识那女的

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,710
<6-18,Raj>你什么时候参加过自行车健身班

<7-2,Sheldon>我想从课本里找出新的研究方向
<7-2,Sheldon>Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry.

229
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,610
<7-2,Sheldon>家里怎么会有本地质学的书
<7-2,Sheldon>Why do we have a Geology book?

230
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,440
<7-2,Sheldon>莱纳德
<7-2,Sheldon>Leonard,

231
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,600
<7-2,Sheldon>我回去德州时  你在家偷偷办了个儿童派对吗
<7-2,Sheldon>did you throw a children's party while I was in Texas?

232
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,470
<7-3,Penny>等等  地理学怎么惹到你了
<7-3,Penny>Wait. What's wrong with geology?

233
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,720
<7-4,Sheldon>让我用你能听懂的方式解释吧  佩妮
<7-4,Sheldon>Let me put this in a way you'll understand, Penny.

234
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,530
<7-4,Sheldon>记得你跟我解释过
<7-4,Sheldon>You remember how you explained to me

235
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,270
<7-4,Sheldon>卡戴珊一家根本算不上真正的明星吗
<7-4,Sheldon>that the Kardashians aren't real celebrities?

236
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,350
<7-4,Sheldon>地理学就是科学界的卡戴珊一家
<7-4,Sheldon>Well, Geology is the Kardashians of science.

237
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,780
<7-5,Sheldon>你考虑过研究标准模型物理学吗
<7-5,Sheldon>Have you considered studying standard model physics?

238
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,850
<7-6,Sheldon>你想让我放弃弦理论
<7-6,Sheldon>You want me to give up string theory

239
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,890
<7-6,Sheldon>去做更落后的项目吗
<7-6,Sheldon>for something that's less advanced?

240
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,240
<7-6,Sheldon>那你为什么不甩掉佩妮
<7-6,Sheldon>You know, why don't you break up with Penny

241
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,430
<7-6,Sheldon>去找个棕熊恋爱呢
<7-6,Sheldon>and start dating a brown bear?

242
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,250
<7-7,Penny>好像你泡得到棕熊似的
<7-7,Penny>Like you could get a brown bear.

<7-8,Leonard>I could buy salmon. You don't know.

245
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,950
<7-9,Amy>或许你可以开始尝试一下
<7-9,Amy>Maybe you could make your new field of study

246
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,050
<7-9,Amy>核矩阵元素的计算工作
<7-9,Amy>the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.

247
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,320
<7-10,Sheldon>得了吧
<7-10,Sheldon>Oh, please.

248
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,160
<7-10,Sheldon>如果我想赶时髦  还不如去搞个骚女纹身呢
<7-10,Sheldon>If I wanted to take up a fad, I'd get a tramp stamp.

249
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,320
<7-11,Leonard>那环圈量子重力学呢
<7-11,Leonard>What about loop quantum gravity?

250
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,190
<7-12,Sheldon>公爵夫人  瞧瞧我
<7-12,Sheldon>Oh, Duchess, look at me.

251
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,160
<7-12,Sheldon>我的量子重力学真是好糊涂[圈]啊
<7-12,Sheldon>My quantum gravity's positively loopy.

252
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,660
<7-13,Penny>公爵夫人是哪位啊
<7-13,Penny>Who's the Duchess?

253
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,730
<7-14,Leonard>他脑子里众多幻想人物之一
<7-14,Leonard>One of the people that lives in his head.

254
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,810
<7-15,Amy>如果他和我分手后  也这么心神错乱就好了
<7-15,Amy>I hope he's this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.

255
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,970
<7-16,Leonard>如果真是  我会让我家熊熊替他介绍对象的
<7-16,Leonard>Well, if he does, I'll see if my bear has a friend.

256
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,230
<7-17,Penny>谢尔顿  你可以试试
<7-17,Penny>Sheldon, have you ever considered

257
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,700
<7-17,Penny>不要急着开始新的研究呀
<7-17,Penny>not rushing into something new?

258
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,130
<7-17,Penny>你为什么不放松一点
<7-17,Penny>I mean, why don't you take your time,

259
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,330
<7-17,Penny>享受享受自由的时间呢
<7-17,Penny>enjoy your freedom?

260
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,090
<7-17,Penny>也许新的课题会主动出现在你面前
<7-17,Penny>Maybe something new to study will find you.

261
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,720
<7-18,Sheldon>这个建议其实还真不错
<7-18,Sheldon>That's actually not bad advice.

262
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,260
<7-18,Sheldon>你知道  我当初也不是主动研究弦理论的
<7-18,Sheldon>You know, I didn't seek out string theory.

263
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,660
<7-18,Sheldon>有一天它就突然对我当头棒喝
<7-18,Sheldon>It just hit me over the head one day.

264
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,390
<7-19,Amy>怎么发生的
<7-19,Amy>How does that happen?

265
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,860
<7-20,Sheldon>一个校园恶霸在图书馆追着我跑
<7-20,Sheldon>A bully chased me through the school library

266
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,750
<7-20,Sheldon>用他手边最重的书打了我的头
<7-20,Sheldon>and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.

267
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,760
<7-21,Penny>我们来为你的自由干杯吧
<7-21,Penny>Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?

268
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,110
<7-22,Sheldon>通常我是不沾酒的
<7-22,Sheldon>Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol,

269
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,370
<7-22,Sheldon>但我的大脑皮层已经在无聊地玩手指了
<7-22,Sheldon>but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs,

270
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,800
<7-22,Sheldon>不如就让它沉浸在
<7-22,Sheldon>why not soak it in grape juice

271
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,130
<7-22,Sheldon>霉菌发酵过的葡萄汁里吧
<7-22,Sheldon>that's been predigested by a fungus?

272
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,450
<7-23,Penny>怪不得其他孩子要用书砸你呢
<7-23,Penny>And you wonder why other children beat you with books.

273
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,610
<7-23,Penny>干杯
<7-23,Penny>Cheers!

274
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,450
<8-1,Bernadette>艾米丽  你是做什么工作的
<8-1,Bernadette>Emily, what do you do?

275
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,270
<8-2,Emily>我是亨廷顿医院的皮肤科医师
<8-2,Emily>I'm a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.

276
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,820
<8-3,Raj>你们都懂其中的意思了吧
<8-3,Raj>Mmm, and you know what that means.

277
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,210
<8-3,Raj>有人的皮肤马上就要吹弹可破了
<8-3,Raj>Someone's skin's about to be softer than ever.

278
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,260
<8-4,Emily>这可折磨死我了
<8-4,Emily>This is making me crazy.

279
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,300
<8-4,Emily>我知道我肯定在哪里见过你
<8-4,Emily>I know I know you from somewhere.

280
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,090
<8-5,Raj>霍华德曾经做过宇航员
<8-5,Raj>Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut.

281
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,380
<8-5,Raj>也许你就是这么认识他的
<8-5,Raj>Maybe that's where you saw him.

282
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,800
<8-6,Emily>太厉害了
<8-6,Emily>That's amazing.

283
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,930
<8-6,Emily>那是什么样的感觉
<8-6,Emily>What was that like?

284
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,930
<8-7,Howard>是我人生中最难忘的体验
<8-7,Howard>It was the most incredible experience of my life.

285
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,410
<8-7,Howard>在太空站里  人会...
<8-7,Howard>Up there in the space station, you're...

286
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,030
<8-8,Emily>我的妈呀  我想起来了
<8-8,Emily>Oh, my God, I remember.

287
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,470
<8-9,Howard>能让我把宇航员的故事说完吗
<8-9,Howard>Can I finish my astronaut story?

288
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,440
<8-10,Emily>这事发生在四年前
<8-10,Emily>It was four years ago.

289
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,510
<8-12,Emily>-求求你别说出来  -别人介绍我们相亲
<8-12,Emily>- Please don't say it. - We were set up on a blind date.

290
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,390
<8-14,Emily>-别说下去了  拜托  -你来了我的公寓
<8-14,Emily>- Please don't say it. - You came to my apartment.

291
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,750
<8-15,Howard>你还是说出来了
<8-15,Howard>You're saying it.

292
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,220
<8-16,Raj>到底发生了什么
<8-16,Raj>Well, wh-what happened?

293
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,720
<8-17,Bernadette>-是啊  发生了什么事  -好吧  我来说吧
<8-17,Bernadette>- Yeah, what happened? - Okay, I'll say it.

294
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,460
<8-18,Howard>我去她家接她
<8-18,Howard>I was on the way to pick her up.

295
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,910
<8-18,Howard>路上我的肠胃开始不舒服了
<8-18,Howard>My stomach felt a little funny.

296
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,510
<8-18,Howard>所以到她家时  我借用了她的厕所
<8-18,Howard>When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.

297
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,010
<8-19,Bernadette>求你别说了
<8-19,Bernadette>Please don't say it.

298
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,140
<8-20,Howard>20分钟过去了  在用完一卷卫生纸后
<8-20,Howard>One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later,

299
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,430
<8-20,Howard>我实在是太羞愧难当
<8-20,Howard>I was so humiliated,

300
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,710
<8-20,Howard>于是我从窗口逃走了  再也没敢去见她
<8-20,Howard>I snuck out the window and never saw her again.

301
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,170
<8-21,Emily>你知道还有什么也跟着你消失了吗
<8-21,Emily>You know what else I never saw again--

302
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,650
<8-21,Emily>我付给房东的清洁押金
<8-21,Emily>my security deposit.

303
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,300
<8-21,Emily>我很抱歉
<8-21,Emily>I'm sorry.

304
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,400
<8-22,Howard>我试着疏通马桶  可找不到马桶塞子
<8-22,Howard>I tried to unclog it, but you didn't have a plunger,

305
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,920
<8-22,Howard>水也流得到处都是
<8-22,Howard>and water was spilling out everywhere.

306
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,720
<8-23,Emily>对  流的只是"水"而已
<8-23,Emily>Right, just water.

307
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,140
<8-24,Howard>这些年我都一直为这事而羞愧
<8-24,Howard>Look, I have felt terrible about this for years,

308
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,580
<8-24,Howard>我也很庆幸今天有这个机会
<8-24,Howard>and I'm glad I have the opportunity

309
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,420
<8-24,Howard>当面向你表达我的歉意
<8-24,Howard>to tell you just how sorry I am.

310
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,790
<8-24,Howard>没关系
<8-24,Howard>It's fine.

311
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,920
<8-25,Emily>我的朋友们都好爱这个故事
<8-25,Emily>All my friends love this story.

312
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,720
<8-25,Emily>他们叫你"卡屎拉"
<8-25,Emily>They call you Clogzilla.

313
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,090
<8-27,Howard>你懂吗
<8-27,Howard>Get it?

314
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,530
<8-26,Raj>因为你是一只卡住了她家马桶的
<8-26,Raj>Because you clogged up her bathroom

315
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,850
<8-26,Raj>怪兽哥斯拉
<8-26,Raj>like a radioactive monster!

316
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,500
<8-27,Howard>我听懂了
<8-27,Howard>Yeah, yeah, I get it.

317
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,300
<8-28,Bernadette>华仔
<8-28,Bernadette>Howie.

318
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,980
<8-29,Howard>你拉的屎也没有跟棉花糖一样美啊
<8-29,Howard>Well, hey, it's not like cotton candy comes out of you.

319
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,100
<9-1,Amy>快点  我们回家睡觉了
<9-1,Amy>Come on, let's get you to bed.

320
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,680
<9-1,Amy>你可喝了不少呢
<9-1,Amy>You've had a lot to drink.

321
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,040
<9-2,Sheldon>-我不比佩妮喝得多  -所以说你喝了不少啊
<9-2,Sheldon>- No more than Penny. - That's what I'm saying.

322
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,380
<9-4,Sheldon>等...等等  等一下
<9-4,Sheldon>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

323
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,500
<9-4,Sheldon>空房间
<9-4,Sheldon>Empty room.

324
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,260
<9-4,Sheldon>空房间
<9-4,Sheldon>Empty room.

325
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,930
<9-4,Sheldon>空房间
<9-4,Sheldon>Empty room.

326
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,300
<9-4,Sheldon>如果有人说"请进"  会把我吓死
<9-4,Sheldon>If somebody says "Come in," I'm gonna freak out.

327
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,170
<9-4,Sheldon>艾米丽
<9-4,Sheldon>So, Emily,

328
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,600
<10-1,Bernadette>你为什么会选择专攻皮肤学呢
<10-1,Bernadette>why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?

329
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,570
<10-2,Emily>我喜欢用刀割人
<10-2,Emily>I like cutting people with knives,

330
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,610
<10-2,Emily>而其它割人的工作都是违法的
<10-2,Emily>and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.

331
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,290
<10-3,Bernadette>你是开玩笑的吧
<10-3,Bernadette>You're kidding, right?

332
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,810
<10-4,Raj>她让人怕怕  不过是可爱的怕怕
<10-4,Raj>She's scary, but it's a cute scary.

333
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,580
<10-5,Howard>我可以再补充一点吗
<10-5,Howard>Can I say just one more thing?

334
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,390
<10-5,Howard>我那天是食物中毒了
<10-5,Howard>I had some kind of food poisoning that day.

335
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,300
<10-5,Howard>当然现在回想起来  加油站寿司
<10-5,Howard>Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi--

336
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,120
<10-5,Howard>不是什么明智的选择
<10-5,Howard>maybe not the best choice.

337
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,010
<10-5,Howard>当然爬出你家窗户逃走也不对
<10-5,Howard>Nor was climbing out your window and running away.

338
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,360
<10-5,Howard>但我想  大家都能理解那情形有多丢人
<10-5,Howard>But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was,

339
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,280
<10-5,Howard>如果咱们能既往不咎  我会非常感激的
<10-5,Howard>and I'd really appreciate it if we could move on.

340
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,930
<10-6,Bernadette>华仔  已经既往不咎一段时间了
<10-6,Bernadette>Howie, we moved on a long time ago.

341
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,510
<10-8,Bernadette>-我只是说...-已经既往不咎了
<10-8,Bernadette>- I'm just saying... - We moved on.

342
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,580
<10-9,Howard>好吧  行
<10-9,Howard>Okay. Fine.

343
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,600
<10-10,Bernadette>你的汤怎么样
<10-10,Bernadette>How's your soup?

344
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,920
<10-11,Howard>还行
<10-11,Howard>Ah, it's all right.

345
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,340
<10-11,Howard>他们可以把碗[马桶]再装得满一点
<10-11,Howard>They could've filled the bowl a little more.

346
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,290
<10-11,Howard>失陪一下
<10-11,Howard>Excuse me.

347
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,270
<10-12,Bernadette>你去哪里
<10-12,Bernadette>Where are you going?

348
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,620
<10-13,Howard>我需要呼吸下新鲜空气
<10-13,Howard>I need some fresh air.

349
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,700
<10-14,Emily>我当时也是
<10-14,Emily>Been there.

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
<11-1,Sheldon>我去
<11-1,Sheldon>Oh, no.

351
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,520
<11-1,Sheldon>我做了什么
<11-1,Sheldon>What have I done?

353
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,500
<12-1,Leonard>感觉怎样
<12-1,Leonard>How you feeling?

354
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,350
<12-2,Sheldon>不太好
<12-2,Sheldon>Not so good.

355
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,340
<12-3,Leonard>不向我介绍一下你的这位朋友吗
<12-3,Leonard>Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?

356
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,360
<12-3,Leonard>这不是我的朋友
<12-3,Leonard>It's not my friend.

357
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,370
<12-4,Sheldon>什么事也没有发生
<12-4,Sheldon>Nothing happened.

358
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,950
<12-5,Leonard>是吗  你昨晚读它的声音可是相当"大"哦
<12-5,Leonard>I don't know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.

359
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,680
<12-6,Sheldon>我的老天啊
<12-6,Sheldon>Oh, dear Lord.

360
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,540
<12-6,Sheldon>艾米呢
<12-6,Sheldon>Where's Amy?

361
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,730
<12-7,Leonard>她把你扶上床休息后就回家了
