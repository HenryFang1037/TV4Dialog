1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,620
<1-1,Penny>-你有听说过加州凡奈斯漫展吗  -有啊
<1-1,Penny>- Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con? - Yeah.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,680
<1-2,Leonard>就是个破烂小展览  卖卖收藏物
<1-2,Leonard>It's a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,260
<1-2,Leonard>请一些不知名惨兮兮的小咖出场  怎么了
<1-2,Leonard>and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,540
<1-3,Penny>我被邀请去办签名会
<1-3,Penny>I got asked to sign autographs there.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,840
<1-4,Leonard>太屌啦
<1-4,Leonard>That's awesome!

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,320
<1-4,Leonard>是因为《杀人恶猿》吗
<1-4,Leonard>Is this for Serial Ape-ist?

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,870
<1-5,Penny>可能是因为这部猴子电影
<1-5,Penny>Well, it could be for the monkey movie.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,470
<1-5,Penny>也可能是因为我拍的痔疮广告
<1-5,Penny>It could be my hemorrhoid commercial.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,660
<1-5,Penny>反正可能性只有这俩
<1-5,Penny>The list does not go on.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,140
<1-6,Leonard>-什么时候  -这不重要
<1-6,Leonard>- When is it? - It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,970
<1-8,Leonard>-我才不去  -为什么  为啥不去
<1-8,Leonard>- I'm not doing it. - What? Why not?

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,630
<1-9,Penny>你刚才自己说了  很惨啊
<1-9,Penny>You just said yourself, it's sad.

13
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,890
<1-10,Leonard>但没有到可悲啊
<1-10,Leonard>Yeah, but it's not pathetic.

14
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,100
<1-10,Leonard>我的底线就是不可悲则可行
<1-10,Leonard>That's where I draw the line.

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,170
<1-10,Leonard>去嘛  肯定有意思
<1-10,Leonard>Come on! We'll have fun.

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,310
<1-11,Penny>我也不知道了
<1-11,Penny>I don't know.

17
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,740
<1-12,Leonard>会有各种宅男对你摇尾乞怜啊
<1-12,Leonard>You'll have nerds fawning all over you.

18
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,550
<1-12,Leonard>如果你不喜欢这感觉  那我们的婚姻要出大事了
<1-12,Leonard>If you don't love that, this marriage is in trouble.

19
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,800
<1-13,Penny>好吧  去见见粉丝
<1-13,Penny>I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet some fans

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,970
<1-13,Penny>顺便赚点外快也不错
<1-13,Penny>and make a little extra money.

21
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,250
<1-15,Penny>对啊
<1-15,Penny>Yeah.

22
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,640
<1-14,Leonard>大导演乔治·卢卡斯...
<1-14,Leonard>Wow! An appearance by George Lucas...

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,920
<1-14,Leonard>的皮肤科医生也会来
<1-14,Leonard>...'s dermatologist.

24
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,100
<1-14,Leonard>-他的签名我也要了  -好好好
<1-14,Leonard>- Oh, I want that autograph. - Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,740
<2-1,Amy>我们现在开始同居了
<2-1,Amy>You know, with us living together,

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,660
<2-1,Amy>是不是能考虑试试邀请客人来玩
<2-1,Amy>maybe we could think about having people over.

36
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,750
<2-2,Sheldon>我们整天有人来访啊
<2-2,Sheldon>We have people over all the time.

37
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,180
<2-2,Sheldon>有维修工  还有披萨外送员...
<2-2,Sheldon>We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man...

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,450
<2-2,Sheldon>还有那个觉得有必要来关心
<2-2,Sheldon>...that UPS driver who feels the need to ask

39
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,310
<2-2,Sheldon>我最近有没有什么"鸟"事的快递员
<2-2,Sheldon>how parts of me are hanging.

40
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,620
<2-3,Amy>你知道我说的是什么意思
<2-3,Amy>You know what I meant.

41
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,990
<2-3,Amy>好吧  行
<2-3,Amy>All right, fine.

42
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,330
<2-4,Sheldon>那就假设我们要宴请朋友
<2-4,Sheldon>Let's say that we were to entertain people.

43
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,230
<2-4,Sheldon>你打算举办哪种聚会呢
<2-4,Sheldon>What type of gathering did you have in mind?

44
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,340
<2-4,Sheldon>吃饭的话  午餐会
<2-4,Sheldon>Huh? A meal? Lunch?

45
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,250
<2-4,Sheldon>早午餐会  还是晚餐会呢
<2-4,Sheldon>Brunch? Dinner?

46
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,270
<2-4,Sheldon>下午茶的话  是正式的吗
<2-4,Sheldon>Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm?

47
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,350
<2-4,Sheldon>还是是个派对呢
<2-4,Sheldon>Is it a party?

48
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,720
<2-4,Sheldon>如果是  那请问是哪种派对
<2-4,Sheldon>And if so, what kind of party?

49
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,690
<2-4,Sheldon>是鸡尾酒派对
<2-4,Sheldon>A cocktail party?

50
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,440
<2-4,Sheldon>直销产品派对
<2-4,Sheldon>A Tupperware party?

51
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,920
<2-4,Sheldon>对了  是惊喜派对吗
<2-4,Sheldon>Ooh, yeah-- is it a surprise party?

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,720
<2-4,Sheldon>我希望不是《西海岸派对》啊
<2-4,Sheldon>Oh, I hope it's not a West Coast party,

53
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,950
<2-4,Sheldon>因为根据电台里这首歌的歌词
<2-4,Sheldon>'cause according to the man on the radio,

54
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,540
<2-4,Sheldon>西海岸派对永不停歇啊
<2-4,Sheldon>a West Coast party don't stop.

55
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,550
<2-5,Amy>对不起  我不应该提起这事
<2-5,Amy>I'm sorry I mentioned it.

56
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,630
<2-6,Sheldon>不用道歉  你心中燃起希望之火
<2-6,Sheldon>Oh, don't be. You get your hopes up,

57
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,610
<2-6,Sheldon>我一桶冷水把它浇熄  这就叫合作无间
<2-6,Sheldon>I knock them down. That's called teamwork.

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,270
<3-1,Howard>踢了
<3-1,Howard>That's a kick.

59
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,450
<3-1,Howard>孩子真的踢了一下
<3-1,Howard>That's an actual kick.

60
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,360
<3-2,Bernadette>你在干嘛
<3-2,Bernadette>What are you doing?

61
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,660
<3-3,Howard>我感觉到踢了一下
<3-3,Howard>I felt a kick.

62
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,010
<3-3,Howard>里面有一个宝宝呢
<3-3,Howard>There's a baby in there.

63
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,820
<3-4,Bernadette>对哦  原来我把宝宝放这里了
<3-4,Bernadette>Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.

64
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,110
<3-5,Howard>我的意思是  我知道你怀孕了
<3-5,Howard>Oh, I mean, I know you're pregnant.

65
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,080
<3-5,Howard>只是...
<3-5,Howard>I just...

66
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,650
<3-5,Howard>我从来没把怀孕
<3-5,Howard>never connected the idea of pregnancy

67
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,180
<3-5,Howard>跟你要生孩子这件事联想到一起
<3-5,Howard>and you actually having a baby.

68
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,560
<3-6,Bernadette>你去的是哪家麻省理工来着
<3-6,Bernadette>Which MIT did you go to?

69
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,440
<3-7,Howard>天啊  我们这房子还没准备好迎接宝宝啊
<3-7,Howard>Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house!

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,880
<3-7,Howard>没有婴儿床  也没有尿布
<3-7,Howard>We don't have a crib, we don't have diapers.

71
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,170
<3-7,Howard>也还没弄婴儿保护措施
<3-7,Howard>We're not baby-proofed.

72
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,900
<3-7,Howard>任何人都可以走进家里  掀开没锁上的马桶盖
<3-7,Howard>Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,840
<3-8,Bernadette>华仔  我们还有时间搞那些东西
<3-8,Bernadette>Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.

74
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,730
<3-9,Howard>真的有吗
<3-9,Howard>Do we?

75
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,540
<3-9,Howard>看看你
<3-9,Howard>Look at you.

76
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,690
<3-9,Howard>就像电影里被推去榨汁的小胖子一样圆
<3-9,Howard>Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.

77
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,390
<3-10,Bernadette>下一个踢你的人会是老娘
<3-10,Bernadette>The next person kicking you will be me.

78
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,710
<3-10,Bernadette>晚安
<3-10,Bernadette>Good night.

79
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,810
<3-11,Howard>我们这里是好的学区...
<3-11,Howard>Are we even in a good school...?

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,770
<3-12,Bernadette>警告过你了  我言出必行
<3-12,Bernadette>I warned you, and I did it.

81
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,680
<4-1,Penny>这是什么
<4-1,Penny>What's all this?

82
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,380
<4-2,Leonard>你办签名会需要的一切东西
<4-2,Leonard>Oh, everything we need for your autograph session--

83
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,030
<4-2,Leonard>-大头照  马克笔  -等等
<4-2,Leonard>- head shots, markers. - Okay.

84
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,740
<4-3,Penny>莱纳德  你对这事很上心是好事
<4-3,Penny>Leonard, it's sweet you're excited about this,

85
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,510
<4-3,Penny>但哪怕是有一个人想要我的签名  都能算奇迹
<4-3,Penny>but it'll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.

86
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,500
<4-4,Leonard>你在开玩笑吧
<4-4,Leonard>Are you kidding?

87
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,490
<4-4,Leonard>我有一次花20块去讨西奥·杀死勒的签名呢
<4-4,Leonard>I once paid $20 for Theo Sassler's signature.

88
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,810
<4-6,Leonard>-他是谁  -我也不认识
<4-6,Leonard>- Who's that? Oh, I don't even know.

89
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,400
<4-6,Leonard>我只是觉得他名字炫  西奥·杀死勒
<4-6,Leonard>I just liked his name. Theo Sassler!

90
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,230
<4-6,Leonard>你看这个
<4-6,Leonard>Oh, and look at this.

91
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,200
<4-6,Leonard>我还弄了一个换零钱机
<4-6,Leonard>I even got a change maker.

92
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,530
<4-6,Leonard>你要换多少零钱  小姑娘
<4-6,Leonard>How much change you want, little lady?

93
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,670
<4-7,Penny>我想要换[掉]的东西多了
<4-7,Penny>Oh, there's so much I want to change.

94
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,970
<4-8,Leonard>如果是想要一块钱换硬币  你就来得巧了
<4-8,Leonard>Yeah, well, if it's a dollar, you're in luck.

95
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,670
<5-1,Amy>这是怎么一回事
<5-1,Amy>What's going on here?

96
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,520
<5-2,Sheldon>你表示出了对邀请客人有兴趣
<5-2,Sheldon>You expressed an interest in having people over,

97
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,810
<5-2,Sheldon>我觉得我太快驳回你的提议了
<5-2,Sheldon>and I feel I dismissed it too quickly.

98
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,190
<5-2,Sheldon>所以我决定亲自着手此事
<5-2,Sheldon>So, I took matters into my own hands,

99
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,360
<5-2,Sheldon>筹办了一场早午餐会
<5-2,Sheldon>and I arranged a brunch.

100
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,120
<5-3,Amy>这真是太好了
<5-3,Amy>Well, that's so nice.

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,660
<5-3,Amy>有谁会来
<5-3,Amy>Who's coming?

102
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,780
<5-4,Sheldon>斯图尔特  地质学实验室的伯特
<5-4,Sheldon>Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab,

103
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,690
<5-4,Sheldon>楼下的佩特雷斯库太太
<5-4,Sheldon>and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.

104
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,800
<5-5,Amy>你是说住二楼的罗马尼亚女士吗
<5-5,Amy>You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,590
<5-5,Amy>是的
<5-5,Amy>Yes.

106
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,550
<5-6,Sheldon>说来也好笑
<5-6,Sheldon>Oh, fun story:

107
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,300
<5-6,Sheldon>她从小是跟十个兄弟姐妹一起长大
<5-6,Sheldon>she grew up with ten siblings.

108
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,730
<5-6,Sheldon>或是跟企鹅一起长大  她的英语太烂了
<5-6,Sheldon>Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.

109
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,300
<5-7,Amy>客人的组合好奇怪啊
<5-7,Amy>That's an odd mix of people.

110
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,970
<5-8,Sheldon>我们第一次邀请客人来家里
<5-8,Sheldon>Well, for our first time hosting,

111
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,610
<5-8,Sheldon>我认为先做个试验是明智之举
<5-8,Sheldon>I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run.

112
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,330
<5-8,Sheldon>就像当年我为了万圣节鬼屋练胆
<5-8,Sheldon>You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house

113
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,420
<5-8,Sheldon>于是我去了公车站的厕所
<5-8,Sheldon>by going into the bathroom at the bus station.

114
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,710
<5-9,Amy>你后来压根没进那间鬼屋
<5-9,Amy>You never went into that haunted house.

115
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,500
<5-10,Sheldon>那是因为你没看见我在公车站受到什么惊吓
<5-10,Sheldon>You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,370
<5-11,Amy>谢谢你  谢尔顿
<5-11,Amy>Well, thank you, Sheldon.

117
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,070
<5-11,Amy>这真是个有趣的惊喜
<5-11,Amy>This is a fun surprise.

118
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,210
<5-12,Sheldon>真正的惊喜是
<5-12,Sheldon>Well, the real surprise is

119
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,050
<5-12,Sheldon>你知道我擅长给人惊喜后有多惊喜
<5-12,Sheldon>how surprised you are that I'm great at surprises.

120
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,050
<5-13,Amy>那根本不算惊喜
<5-13,Amy>Well, that's not a surprise at all.

121
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,740
<5-13,Amy>如果我本来就知道你擅长给人惊喜
<5-13,Amy>I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises,

122
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,300
<5-13,Amy>那我就会预计到有这个惊喜
<5-13,Amy>I would have expected the surprise,

123
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,480
<5-13,Amy>然后就不会被你"惊喜到"
<5-13,Amy>and therefore not have been surprised.

124
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,600
<5-14,Sheldon>可事实上是  我之前不知道
<5-14,Sheldon>But as it is, I didn't know,

125
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,810
<5-14,Sheldon>所以我"惊喜"的样子  你根本不该觉得惊喜
<5-14,Sheldon>and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising.

126
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,470
<5-14,Sheldon>不许用言语挑逗人家  客人随时会到
<5-14,Sheldon>Don't get me all randy. Guests are on the way.

127
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,790
<6-1,Howard>回来啦
<6-1,Howard>Hi.

128
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,820
<6-2,Bernadette>你们去哪儿了
<6-2,Bernadette>Hey, where you been?

129
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,390
<6-3,Howard>我们去给宝宝买了点东西
<6-3,Howard>Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.

130
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,050
<6-4,Raj>你等着瞧我们选的婴儿床吧
<6-4,Raj>Wait till you see the crib we found.

131
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,790
<6-5,Bernadette>你买婴儿床不用问过我吗
<6-5,Bernadette>You bought a crib without me?

132
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,010
<6-6,Howard>-你肯定会喜欢的  -对啊
<6-6,Howard>- You're gonna love it. - Yeah.

133
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,580
<6-7,Raj>它是市场上评价最好的一款
<6-7,Raj>It's the highest rated one on the market.

134
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,070
<6-7,Raj>要我就不会说那是婴儿床
<6-7,Raj>I wouldn't even call it a crib.

135
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,840
<6-7,Raj>我会称其为"宝宝的孤独城堡"
<6-7,Raj>I'd call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.

136
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,550
<6-8,Bernadette>听起来就是贵货啊
<6-8,Bernadette>Sounds expensive.

137
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,170
<6-9,Howard>好吧  我可能有点太舍得了
<6-9,Howard>Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard,

138
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,790
<6-9,Howard>可安全是无价之宝啊
<6-9,Howard>but you can't put a price on safety.

139
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,480
<6-10,Raj>但如果非要给个价  那会比你想象中多很多个0
<6-10,Raj>Though if you did, it's more zeroes than you're expecting.

140
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,800
<6-11,Howard>但那是市面上最安全的婴儿床
<6-11,Howard>But it's the safest crib you can buy.

141
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,260
<6-11,Howard>而且如果你不喜欢  我们可以退掉啊
<6-11,Howard>And if you don't like it, we can return it.

142
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,710
<6-13,Howard>-好吧  -它在我们的新面包车里呢
<6-13,Howard>- Fine. - In our new minivan.

143
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,290
<6-13,Howard>中午吃什么呀
<6-13,Howard>Hey, what's for lunch?

144
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
<6-14,Bernadette>你还买了一辆面包车吗
<6-14,Bernadette>You bought a minivan?!

145
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,960
<6-15,Howard>那是为了宝宝啊  而且我又没买
<6-15,Howard>It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it.

146
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,860
<6-15,Howard>卖车那人借给我试开一天
<6-15,Howard>The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.

147
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,080
<6-16,Raj>但我们搬婴儿床时  把车后备厢撞得挺狠的
<6-16,Raj>Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib,

148
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,560
<6-16,Raj>所以你很可能得买下这辆面包车
<6-16,Raj>so you might have bought a minivan.

149
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,360
<6-17,Bernadette>我不想开这车  太老妈子风了
<6-17,Bernadette>I don't want to drive that. It's such a mom car.

150
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,260
<6-18,Howard>卖车那人说
<6-18,Howard>The guy at the dealership said

151
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,450
<6-18,Howard>这车不再只适用于妈妈
<6-18,Howard>they're not just for moms anymore.

152
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,540
<6-19,Raj>但我还想说  那人的确认为你是我老公
<6-19,Raj>Then again, he did think you were my husband.

153
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,930
<6-20,Bernadette>照B超的人也这么想
<6-20,Bernadette>They thought it at the ultrasound.

154
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,360
<6-20,Bernadette>卖车的人会这么想也不出奇
<6-20,Bernadette>Why not at the car dealership?

155
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,420
<7-1,Leonard>从来没坐过在桌子的这一端
<7-1,Leonard>Never been on this side of the table before.

156
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,530
<7-1,Leonard>感觉可以呼风唤雨啊
<7-1,Leonard>I feel powerful.

157
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,880
<7-1,Leonard>是咩
<7-1,Leonard>Really?

158
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,830
<7-2,Penny>有种像为了队伍筹款买新制服  而卖糖果的感觉
<7-2,Penny>I feel like I'm selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.

159
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,830
<7-3,Leonard>签一张黑白照4块7毛5
<7-3,Leonard>Okay, so it's $4.75 for a signed black-and-white

160
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,190
<7-3,Leonard>彩照9块9毛5
<7-3,Leonard>and $9.95 for a color.

161
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,130
<7-4,Penny>好的  干嘛不直接收5块和10块
<7-4,Penny>Right. Why not five and ten bucks?

162
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,850
<7-5,Leonard>我带了换零钱机[性感本钱]  让人家甩甩嘛
<7-5,Leonard>Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.

164
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,340
<7-6,Penny>那个家伙正往这边看呢
<7-6,Penny>Hey, that guy's looking over here.

165
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,650
<7-7,Leonard>你觉得他会是第一位买你签名的粉丝吗
<7-7,Leonard>You think he's your first autograph?

166
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,550
<7-8,Penny>不知道  淡定  他过来了  他过来了
<7-8,Penny>I don't know. Be cool. He's coming. He's coming.

167
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,580
<7-9,Guy>我超爱你的电影
<7-9,Guy>I love your movie.

168
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,590
<7-10,Penny>谢谢
<7-10,Penny>Well, thanks.

169
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,840
<7-11,Guy>绝对是我人生中看过
<7-11,Guy>It has got to be one of the worst things

170
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,210
<7-11,Guy>最糟糕的东西之一
<7-11,Guy>I've ever seen in my life.

172
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,110
<7-12,Penny>你的爱使我困惑
<7-12,Penny>Your love confuses me.

173
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,890
<7-13,Leonard>-想来张签名照吗  -好啊
<7-13,Leonard>- Would you like an autograph? - Sure.

174
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,750
<7-15,Penny>-好的  签给谁  -丹尼尔
<7-15,Penny>- Okay. Who do I make it out to? - Daniel.

175
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,500
<7-17,Penny>-好的  -我想知道
<7-17,Penny>- Okay. - I have to ask.

176
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,240
<7-18,Daniel>你是故意演这么烂
<7-18,Daniel>Were you trying to be that bad,

177
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,010
<7-18,Daniel>还是你本身演技就烂
<7-18,Daniel>or are you just a terrible actress?

178
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,050
<7-19,Penny>您这话更让我摸不着头脑了
<7-19,Penny>That did not clear things up.

179
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,090
<7-20,Leonard>一张4块7毛5
<7-20,Leonard>That'll be $4.75.

180
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,990
<7-21,Daniel>不用找了
<7-21,Daniel>Keep the change.

181
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,010
<7-22,Leonard>可我...
<7-22,Leonard>But I...

182
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,320
<7-22,Leonard>全程糟透了
<7-22,Leonard>Nothing about that was good.

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,720
<8-1,Amy>没什么好怕的  谢尔顿
<8-1,Amy>There's nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.

184
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,150
<8-2,Sheldon>木塞的平均速度是每小时40公里
<8-2,Sheldon>The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour.

185
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,720
<8-2,Sheldon>如果这速度在学校操场算飞快
<8-2,Sheldon>If that is too fast around a school,

186
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,080
<8-2,Sheldon>那么在厨房也肯定是
<8-2,Sheldon>it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,430
<8-3,Amy>我想说  已经耗15分钟了
<8-3,Amy>Been 15 minutes. Just sayin'.

188
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,660
<8-4,Sheldon>好吧  我能行
<8-4,Sheldon>Okay. I can do this.

189
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,120
<8-4,Sheldon>再给我点时间
<8-4,Sheldon>Just give me a moment...

190
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,230
<8-4,Sheldon>含羞草香槟来了
<8-4,Sheldon>Mimosas coming up.

191
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,500
<8-5,Bert>我有一次把橙汁放在冰箱的时间久到
<8-5,Bert>I once left orange juice in my fridge so long,

192
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,070
<8-5,Bert>它喝起来像含羞草酒
<8-5,Bert>it tasted like a mimosa.

193
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,210
<8-6,Amy>到底放了多久
<8-6,Amy>How old was it?

194
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,520
<8-7,Bert>不好说
<8-7,Bert>It's hard to say.

195
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,640
<8-7,Bert>我喝完之后就不省人事了
<8-7,Bert>I don't remember much after I drank it.

196
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,720
<8-8,Sheldon>你想来一杯吗  佩特雷斯库太太
<8-8,Sheldon>Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?

197
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,420
<8-8,Sheldon>当然
<8-8,Sheldon>Yes.

198
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,690
<8-9,Mrs Petrescu>酒好  好友  尽在苹果蜂餐厅
<8-9,Mrs Petrescu>Drink is fun and good friends-- Applebee's.

200
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,020
<8-10,Sheldon>她的英语都是看电视学的
<8-10,Sheldon>She's learning English from TV.

201
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,330
<8-11,Mrs Petrescu>电视  很棒啊  画面回到现场主播
<8-11,Mrs Petrescu>TV, good. Now back to you.

202
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,220
<8-12,Stuart>大伙们
<8-12,Stuart>Hey, guys.

203

<8-20,Stuart>我有错过什么吗
<8-20,Stuart>So, what did I miss?

211
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,130
<8-21,Bert>我们见证了谢尔顿耗费15分钟打开一瓶酒
<8-21,Bert>Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.

212
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,480
<8-22,Mrs Petrescu>15分钟可以帮您节省15%以上的汽车保险哦
<8-22,Mrs Petrescu>15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.

214
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,890
<8-23,Stuart>这聚会还有其他人来吗
<8-23,Stuart>Anybody else coming to this thing?

215
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,110
<9-1,Penny>你叫什么名字
<9-1,Penny>What's your name?

217
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,060
<9-4,Jeff>我最喜欢的部分就是你洗澡那一段
<9-4,Jeff>My favorite part is your shower scene.

218
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,030
<9-5,Penny>这话今天我可听了不少次
<9-5,Penny>Been hearing that a lot today.

219
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,990
<9-6,Jeff>我还用手机截了图
<9-6,Jeff>I even have a screen grab on my phone.

220
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,420
<9-7,Penny>没错  就是这对宝贝
<9-7,Penny>Yep, there they are.

222
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,990
<9-9,Penny>给你
<9-9,Penny>Here you go.

223
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,380
<9-10,Leonard>我真该揍这个小子
<9-10,Leonard>Should've punched that guy.

224
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,260
<9-11,Penny>想揍就揍吧  他就在那儿呢
<9-11,Penny>Well, go ahead. He's right over there.

225
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,450
<9-12,Leonard>施主何苦要点破  就不能让我意淫一下吗
<9-12,Leonard>Why do you do that? Can't you let me have my moment?

226
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,230
<9-13,Penny>-你好  -你好
<9-13,Penny>- Hello. - Hi.

227
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,390
<9-14,Awkward guy>我喜欢你拍的电影

<9-16,Awkward guy>-谢谢  -两个我都看过哦
<9-16,Awkward guy>- Thank you! - I saw both of them.

229
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,860
<9-17,Penny>我想你是指我的两部电影吧
<9-17,Penny>I assume we're still talking about the movies,

230
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,100
<9-17,Penny>但根据今日对话  "两个"还真不一定
<9-17,Penny>but after today, who knows.

231
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,710
<9-18,Awkward guy>可以和你合影留念吗
<9-18,Awkward guy>You think I could get a picture of us?

232
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,650
<9-19,Penny>当然
<9-19,Penny>Oh, sure.

233
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,450
<9-20,Awkward guy>可以和你接吻留念吗
<9-20,Awkward guy>And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?

234
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,410
<9-21,Leonard>不行  她不能亲...
<9-21,Leonard>No. She cannot kiss...

235
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,500
<9-21,Leonard>你们都有什么毛病啊
<9-21,Leonard>What is wrong with you people?!

236
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,510
<9-23,Leonard>-莱纳德  -不行  这样是不对的
<9-23,Leonard>- Leonard... - No, no, no. It's not okay.

237
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,160
<9-24,Awkward guy>-你是哪根葱啊  -我是她老公
<9-24,Awkward guy>- Who are you? - I'm her husband.

238
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
<9-23,Leonard>谁信啊
<9-23,Leonard>No, you're not.

239
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,630
<9-27,Leonard>我真的是
<9-27,Leonard>I am.

240
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,700
<9-28,Penny>对  他真是我老公
<9-28,Penny>Yeah, he really is.

241
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,540
<9-28,Penny>鬼才信
<9-28,Penny>No.

242
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,330
<10-1,Howard>这车配置了倒车摄像头  光盘播放器
<10-1,Howard>It's got a rearview camera, there's a DVD player--

243
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,980
<10-1,Howard>你再看这个
<10-1,Howard>oh, and check this out.

244
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,190
<10-1,Howard>是不是感觉自己进入了未来世界
<10-1,Howard>It's like we're living in the future!

245
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,560
<10-2,Raj>给她演示后备箱  给她演示后备箱
<10-2,Raj>Hey, show her the trunk! Show her the trunk!

246
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,930
<10-3,Howard>想象一下  你左手抱着娃
<10-3,Howard>Imagine this: you've got the baby in one hand,

247
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,640
<10-3,Howard>右手提着菜  你对自己说
<10-3,Howard>groceries in the other, and you're thinking,

248
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,630
<10-3,Howard>"我要怎么开后备箱呢"
<10-3,Howard>"How am I gonna open this trunk?"

249
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,850
<10-4,Bernadette>我应该会对自己说  "我那个猪头老公呢
<10-4,Bernadette>I'm probably thinking, "Where's my husband,

250
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,170
<10-4,Bernadette>他为什么不过来帮我"
<10-4,Bernadette>and why isn't he helping me?"

251
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,650
<10-5,Howard>当轻轻一踢就可以打开后备箱时
<10-5,Howard>You don't need my help when you can open the trunk

252
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,920
<10-5,Howard>你就根本不需要我帮忙了
<10-5,Howard>with a simple kick of the foot.

253
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,170
<10-6,Raj>不  人家是轻踢  你没做到位
<10-6,Raj>No, it's a gentle kick; you're doing it wrong.

254
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,730
<10-6,Raj>来  把东西都给我
<10-6,Raj>Here. Give me those.

255
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,030
<10-7,Howard>是不是应该用脚画个圈呀
<10-7,Howard>Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?

256
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,020
<10-8,Bernadette>卖车的人以为你们俩是夫妻  完全不"出奇"啊
<10-8,Bernadette>It's weird that guy thought you were a couple.

257
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,980
<10-9,Howard>-开了  -开了
<10-9,Howard>- Yes! - Yes!

258
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,360
<10-10,Raj>看到没
<10-10,Raj>See?

259
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,490
<10-11,Howard>轻而易举
<10-11,Howard>Easy.

260
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,360
<10-11,Howard>看看这宽敞的后备箱空间
<10-11,Howard>And look at all this cargo space.

261
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,600
<10-11,Howard>等我们把婴儿床搬出来
<10-11,Howard>You know, we'll get the crib out

262
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,070
<10-11,Howard>你就可以上车试开了
<10-11,Howard>and you can take it for a test-drive.

263
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,510
<10-11,Howard>告诉你  这辆厢型车绝对是...
<10-11,Howard>I'm telling you, this van is gonna be...

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,160
<10-12,Bernadette>伤到你的背了吗
<10-12,Bernadette>Oh, is it your back?

265
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,590
<10-12,Bernadette>是的
<10-12,Bernadette>Uh... yeah.

266
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,260
<10-13,Howard>没事  我们先上车
<10-13,Howard>Anyway, let's just get in and see if the GPS

267
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,160
<10-13,Howard>试试看导航能否带我们去最近的急诊室
<10-13,Howard>can take us to the nearest emergency room.

268
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,060
<11-1,Sheldon>所以直到艾米的公寓修好之前
<11-1,Sheldon>So until Amy's apartment is fixed,

269
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,280
<11-1,Sheldon>她和我都将在这住
<11-1,Sheldon>she and I are living here together.

270
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,230
<11-2,Bert>我也曾和我的前女友住在一起
<11-2,Bert>I lived with my old girlfriend.

271
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,280
<11-2,Bert>她也是位地质学家
<11-2,Bert>She was a geologist, too.

272
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,790
<11-3,Amy>后来你俩吹了吗
<11-3,Amy>Things didn't work out?

273
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,340
<11-4,Bert>有一天我下班回家  她把一切都卷跑了
<11-4,Bert>I came home from work one day and she had taken everything.

274
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,580
<11-4,Bert>友情提示
<11-4,Bert>I'm warning you,

275
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,960
<11-4,Bert>记得把好的石头标本都藏起来
<11-4,Bert>hide your good rocks.

276
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,060
<11-5,Mrs Petrescu>我妹夫也把她的东西卷跑了
<11-5,Mrs Petrescu>My sister's husband took all her things, too.

277
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,000
<11-5,Mrs Petrescu>11点即将播出
<11-5,Mrs Petrescu>Story at 11:00.

278
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,980
<11-6,Stuart>真的没有其他客人来了吗
<11-6,Stuart>Really, no one else is coming?

279
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,190
<11-7,Sheldon>没有了
<11-7,Sheldon>Oh, this is it.

280
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,240
<11-7,Sheldon>你们这算是练习赛
<11-7,Sheldon>You are the practice round.

281
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,490
<11-8,Stuart>练习赛  练习什么
<11-8,Stuart>Practice round? For-for what?

282
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,250
<11-9,Amy>不  他的意思是
<11-9,Amy>Uh, no. He-he just means that

283
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,160
<11-9,Amy>你们是我们首先想到的人
<11-9,Amy>you were the first people we thought of.

284
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,090
<11-10,Sheldon>没有错
<11-10,Sheldon>You know, exactly.

285
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,580
<11-10,Sheldon>我们从未邀请过别人来吃早午餐
<11-10,Sheldon>We've never thrown a brunch before,

286
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,240
<11-10,Sheldon>我想先试试水
<11-10,Sheldon>and I wanted to work out all the kinks.

287
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,140
<11-11,Stuart>所以我就相当于
<11-11,Stuart>So, I'm like a lab rat

288
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,440
<11-11,Stuart>你真正的朋友来之前的小白鼠
<11-11,Stuart>before your real friends come over?

289
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,950
<11-12,Sheldon>你的话非常合理
<11-12,Sheldon>You see, your words sound reasonable,

290
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,440
<11-12,Sheldon>但你的表情非常生气
<11-12,Sheldon>but your face looks angry.

291
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,100
<11-12,Sheldon>快帮我一下  我最不擅长这个了
<11-12,Sheldon>Help me out here. This is not where I shine.

292
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,280
<11-13,Amy>斯图尔特  你知道你是我们最爱的朋友之一
<11-13,Amy>Stuart, you know you're one of our favorite people.

293
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,750
<11-14,Sheldon>你的表情非常真挚
<11-14,Sheldon>Okay, now, see, you look sincere,

294
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,210
<11-14,Sheldon>但你的话却错得离谱
<11-14,Sheldon>but your words are completely false.

295
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,270
<11-14,Sheldon>幸好我们举行了这个练习赛
<11-14,Sheldon>I'm glad we did this test run.

296
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,480
<11-14,Sheldon>早午餐可真是不好办啊
<11-14,Sheldon>These brunches are wild!

297
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,480
<12-1,Awkward guy>你是怎样成功让她同意跟你约会的啊
<12-1,Awkward guy>But how did you get her to go out with you?

298
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,430
<12-2,Leonard>她刚好搬到了我家对面
<12-2,Leonard>Well, she moved in across the hall.

299
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,370
<12-3,Penny>他不断纠缠让我慢慢放弃抵抗
<12-3,Penny>And he started to slowly wear me down.

300
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,760
<12-4,Leonard>只要功夫深  铁杵也能磨成针
<12-4,Leonard>Like a river carves a canyon.

301
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,690
<12-5,Penny>不同的是  磨针的人老是跟我显摆他的宠物精灵卡
<12-5,Penny>Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokemon cards.

302
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,000
<12-6,Red-haired guy>可以走了吗
<12-6,Red-haired guy>Ready to go?

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,950
<12-7,Awkward guy>等等  这个人跟我说了
<12-7,Awkward guy>Hang on. This guy's telling me

304
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,590
<12-7,Awkward guy>他怎么让《杀人恶猿》女主嫁给他
<12-7,Awkward guy>how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.

305
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,270
<12-8,Red-haired guy>这货吗
<12-8,Red-haired guy>This guy?

306
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,610
<12-8,Red-haired guy>可他别了个换零钱机
<12-8,Red-haired guy>But he's wearing a change maker.

307
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,590
<12-9,Penny>我觉得特性感
<12-9,Penny>I think it's hot.

308
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,420
<12-9,Penny>没错
<12-9,Penny>That's right.

309
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,140
<12-10,Leonard>我是她的零钱干爹
<12-10,Leonard>I'm her change daddy.

310
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,520
<13-1,Howard>我当时在想什么呢
<13-1,Howard>What was I thinking?

311
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,880
<13-1,Howard>沃罗威茨家的人搬不了重物
<13-1,Howard>Wolowitzes are not a lifting people!

312
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,190
<13-1,Howard>我们付小费给搬重物的人
<13-1,Howard>We tip the lifting people!

313
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,720
<13-2,Bernadette>我们真要在急诊室里等几个小时吗
<13-2,Bernadette>Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room?

314
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,240
<13-2,Bernadette>还不是会和上次一样  给你点冰和止痛药
<13-2,Bernadette>They're just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.

315
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,760
<13-3,Howard>等我以后靠轮椅生活  你就后悔去吧
<13-3,Howard>You're gonna feel terrible when I'm in a wheelchair.

316
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,110
<13-3,Howard>顺便说一下  真有轮椅  也可以轻松地装进
<13-3,Howard>Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back

317
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,350
<13-3,Howard>这台获奖的商旅车的后备箱
<13-3,Howard>of this award-winning minivan.

318
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,420
<13-4,Bernadette>行了  我们去急诊
<13-4,Bernadette>Fine, we'll go to the E.R.

319
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,220
<13-4,Bernadette>你就别再给这车打广告了
<13-4,Bernadette>Just stop selling me on the van.

320
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,160
<13-5,Howard>你说对  它自己就是最棒的广告
<13-5,Howard>You're right. It sells itself.

321
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,180
<13-6,Raj>你也不得不承认  行驶确实平稳
<13-6,Raj>You have to admit, it's a pretty smooth ride.

322
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,220
<13-7,Bernadette>噪音小点就更好了
<13-7,Bernadette>I was hoping it'd be quieter.

323
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,660
<13-8,Howard>生孩子要有这一半疼
<13-8,Howard>If childbirth is half this bad,

324
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,020
<13-8,Howard>你就死定了
<13-8,Howard>you are so screwed!

325
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,350
<13-8,Howard>-我们到了吗  -快了
<13-8,Howard>- Are we there yet?! - Soon.

326
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,400
<13-10,Howard>为什么这么久
<13-10,Howard>Why is it taking so long?!

327
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,070
<13-11,Raj>霍华德  霍华德  看屏幕
<13-11,Raj>H-Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen.

328
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,740
<13-11,Raj>我在播《蝙蝠侠之风云突变》  你的最爱
<13-11,Raj>I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favorite!

329
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,430
<13-12,Howard>太疼了  没心情看卡通
<13-12,Howard>I'm in too much pain to watch cartoo...

330
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,920
<13-12,Howard>这集好看
<13-12,Howard>Oh! This is a good one.

331
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,070
<13-13,Raj>我带这孩子的时间  可比你长多了
<13-13,Raj>I've been babysitting him way longer than you have.

332
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,530
<13-14,Bernadette>行  我买这台蠢车还不行吗
<13-14,Bernadette>Fine. I'll buy the stupid van.

333
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,320
<14-1,Bert>我从来没吃过这么好吃的薄饼
<14-1,Bert>This is the best blintz I've ever had.

334
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,060
<14-2,Sheldon>谢谢
<14-2,Sheldon>Oh. Thank you.

335
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,430
<14-3,Bert>十分美味  只差一点就能挽回
<14-3,Bert>It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn

336
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,400
<14-3,Bert>刚刚万分尴尬的局面呢
<14-3,Bert>things took earlier.

337
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,820
<14-4,Stuart>我说  我还是走吧
<14-4,Stuart>You know what, I-I think I'm just gonna go.

338
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,320
<14-5,Amy>不  斯图尔特  别走
<14-5,Amy>No, Stuart, don't.

339
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,120
<14-6,Stuart>不  我把你和谢尔顿当成我的家人
<14-6,Stuart>No, I-I consider you and Sheldon like my family,

340
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,390
<14-6,Stuart>可我都不确定  你们有没有把我当朋友
<14-6,Stuart>and I'm not even sure you think of me as a friend.

341
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,790
<14-6,Stuart>你懂那种感受吗
<14-6,Stuart>You have any idea how that feels?

342
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,420
<14-7,Amy>我们非常抱歉
<14-7,Amy>We're so sorry.

343
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,040
<14-8,Stuart>我总是最后一个被想起的家伙
<14-8,Stuart>I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.

344
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,690
<14-9,Sheldon>不  不是这样的
<14-9,Sheldon>Well, no, that's not true.

345
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,300
<14-9,Sheldon>偶尔是库萨帕里
<14-9,Sheldon>I mean, sometimes it's Koothrappali.

346
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,140
<14-9,Sheldon>但我们不应该这么说
<14-9,Sheldon>But we're not supposed to say that

347
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,160
<14-9,Sheldon>他是有色人种  怕有歧视嫌疑
<14-9,Sheldon>'cause he's a minority.

348
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,430
<14-10,Stuart>再见
<14-10,Stuart>Bye.

349
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,560
<14-11,Sheldon>斯图尔特  等等
<14-11,Sheldon>Stuart, wait.

350
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,850
<14-11,Sheldon>我确实知道被冷落的感受
<14-11,Sheldon>I do know what it feels like to be left out.

351
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,200
<14-12,Bert>我也知道那种感受
<14-12,Bert>I know how it feels, too.

352
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,480
<14-13,Sheldon>知道了  这是我和他之间的问题  没你事
<14-13,Sheldon>All right, this is about me and him; you're not part of it.

353
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,730
<14-13,Sheldon>斯图尔特  也许我们太不重视你的好
<14-13,Sheldon>Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted,

354
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,440
<14-13,Sheldon>这是不可接受的错误
<14-13,Sheldon>and that is not acceptable.

355
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,400
<14-13,Sheldon>但请你知道  你真的是我们这个社交团体中
<14-13,Sheldon>Please know that you truly are a valuable member

356
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,170
<14-13,Sheldon>非常重要的一员
<14-13,Sheldon>of our social group.

357
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,160
<14-14,Stuart>谢谢
<14-14,Stuart>Thank you.

358
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,960
<14-15,Sheldon>这样  我想举杯祝酒
<14-15,Sheldon>You know, in fact, I'd like to propose a toast.

359
