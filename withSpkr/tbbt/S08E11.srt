1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,630
<1-1,Penny>你父母的情况怎么样了
<1-1,Penny>Hey, how are things going with your parents?

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,100
<1-2,Sheldon>不太好  他们请了离婚律师
<1-2,Sheldon>Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,060
<1-2,Sheldon>说到律师
<1-2,Sheldon>You know, speaking of attorneys,

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,540
<1-2,Sheldon>如果哪天我需要请律师
<1-2,Sheldon>if I ever needed a lawyer,

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,960
<1-2,Sheldon>我绝对不会请女浩克
<1-2,Sheldon>I would not hire She-Hulk.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,960
<1-2,Sheldon>绿巨人浩克的表妹  有弱化版的绿巨人变身能力
<1-2,Sheldon>常为超级英雄们打官司

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,960
<1-3,Penny>其实呢  你这次跟主题很接近了
<1-3,Penny>You know what? That was almost on topic.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,320
<1-3,Penny>所以我要说"点赞哦  谢尔顿"
<1-3,Penny>I'm gonna say, "Good job, Sheldon."

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,950
<1-4,Amy>等等  女浩克是个律师吗
<1-4,Amy>Wait, She-Hulk's a lawyer?

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,940
<1-5,Howard>是啊  她在纽约一家律师事务所做事
<1-5,Howard>Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,360
<1-6,Sheldon>是的  但是她是所里唯一的怪物
<1-6,Sheldon>Yes, but she's the only monster at the firm.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,190
<1-6,Sheldon>我说了别传出去啊
<1-6,Sheldon>Between you, me and the wall,

13
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,550
<1-6,Sheldon>我觉得她是因为平权法案才被请的怪物
<1-6,Sheldon>I think she's an affirmative action hire.

14
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,550
<1-6,Sheldon>为防止对肤色  宗教  性别  民族出身有所歧视
<1-6,Sheldon>在就业  教育等方面给予优待而达到平等的措施

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,550
<1-7,Raj>总而言之  我爸会来找我
<1-7,Raj>Anyway, Dad's gonna be here in town,

16
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,150
<1-7,Raj>所以我今年没办法替大家办圣诞晚宴了
<1-7,Raj>so I won't be able to do Christmas dinner this year.

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,340
<1-8,Amy>如果今年你没办法主办圣诞晚宴
<1-8,Amy>If you're not up to hosting Christmas dinner,

18
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,450
<1-8,Amy>我很乐意来做啊
<1-8,Amy>I'm happy to do it.

19
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,400
<1-8,Amy>你还可以带你父亲一起来
<1-8,Amy>You can even bring your father.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,800
<1-9,Raj>那真是太好了
<1-9,Raj>That would be nice.

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,770
<1-10,Amy>我一直都想过一次传统维多利亚式圣诞
<1-10,Amy>I've always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas.

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,940
<1-10,Amy>玩会客厅游戏  吃圣诞烤鹅与果干布丁
<1-10,Amy>Parlor games, goose and figgy pudding...

24
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,940
<1-10,Amy>当年家里有"会客厅"的中上阶层家庭的娱乐活动
<1-10,Amy>圣诞烤鹅与广式脆皮烧鹅类似

25
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,780
<1-11,Sheldon>英式布丁
<1-11,Sheldon>English pudding.

26
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,680
<1-11,Sheldon>英式布丁常是蛋糕状的甜点
<1-11,Sheldon>而不是美式的偏果冻状布丁

27
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,680
<1-11,Sheldon>本来满心期待有"布丁"吃
<1-11,Sheldon>Y-You get yourself all excited for pudding,

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,890
<1-11,Sheldon>结果是英式的破葡萄干蛋糕
<1-11,Sheldon>and here comes a cake with raisins in it.

29
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,510
<1-11,Sheldon>我不去
<1-11,Sheldon>I'm not going.

30
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,650
<1-12,Amy>你就得来
<1-12,Amy>You're going.

31
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,690
<1-13,Sheldon>我跟你什么仇什么怨啊
<1-13,Sheldon>Why do you hate me?

32
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,340
<1-14,Amy>我跟你无冤无仇
<1-14,Amy>I don't hate you.

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,380
<1-14,Amy>我爱你
<1-14,Amy>I love you.

34
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,090
<1-15,Sheldon>你把它称之为爱也行
<1-15,Sheldon>Well, you call it love,

35
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,670
<1-15,Sheldon>但里面还是有一堆葡萄干
<1-15,Sheldon>but it has a lot of raisins in it.

36
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,790
<1-16,Raj>艾米  让这几个家伙对主题晚餐有兴趣
<1-16,Raj>Amy, good luck getting these guys excited

37
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,260
<1-16,Raj>简直比登天还难
<1-16,Raj>about a dinner with a theme.

38
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,100
<1-16,Raj>我的汤姆·汉克斯感恩节就因为没人捧场而放弃
<1-16,Raj>I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.

39
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,080
<1-17,Bernadette>我觉得维多利亚式圣诞很不错啊
<1-17,Bernadette>I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,150
<1-18,Howard>-同意  -我也觉得
<1-18,Howard>- I agree. - Me, too.

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,320
<1-18,Howard>你们这群混蛋
<1-18,Howard>You guys suck!

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,640
<2-1,Leonard>你知道在无尘室里工作最棒的是什么吗
<2-1,Leonard>You know the best part of working in the clean room?

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,920
<2-1,Leonard>不会过敏
<2-1,Leonard>No allergies.

50
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,110
<2-1,Leonard>你看
<2-1,Leonard>Check it out.

51
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,750
<2-1,Leonard>鼻子太通  一下吸进的氧气有点多
<2-1,Leonard>Oh, that-that... that's a lot of oxygen.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
<2-2,Howard>我们该去艾米家了
<2-2,Howard>We should get going to Amy's.

53
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,290
<2-3,Leonard>你能相信曾几何时
<2-3,Leonard>Can you believe there was a time

54
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,800
<2-3,Leonard>人类得靠着
<2-3,Leonard>when we would have needed an array

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,820
<2-3,Leonard>巨大的切伦科夫望远镜阵列  来探测宇宙射线粒子
<2-3,Leonard>of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles?

56
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
<2-3,Leonard>而如今我们自己就可以构建多线探测器
<2-3,Leonard>And here we are building our own multi-wire detector

57
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,770
<2-3,Leonard>简直霸气到炸啊
<2-3,Leonard>like a couple of badasses.

58
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,030
<2-4,Howard>是啊  如果我们还单身
<2-4,Howard>I know. If we were still single,

59
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,180
<2-4,Howard>都可以在女人堆里打滚了
<2-4,Howard>we'd be tripping over all that booty.

60
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,720
<2-5,Leonard>女人的确喜欢男人打扮得像个厨房垃圾袋
<2-5,Leonard>Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag.

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,180
<2-5,Leonard>惨了
<2-5,Leonard>Oh, no.

62
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,050
<2-6,Howard>这鸽子是怎么飞进来的
<2-6,Howard>How the hell did a pigeon get in here?

63
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,270
<2-7,Leonard>-你关了外门对吧  -我以为你关了
<2-7,Leonard>- You shut the loading doors, right? - I thought you did.

64
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,480
<2-9,Leonard>你知道这有多严重吗
<2-9,Leonard>Do you know what a disaster this is?!

65
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,560
<2-10,Howard>你是指因为这无尘室应该是要一尘不染
<2-10,Howard>You mean 'cause this room isn't supposed to have dust in it,

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,530
<2-10,Howard>而我们放了一只会飞的拉屎机进来吗
<2-10,Howard>and we just let in a flying crap machine?!

67
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,350
<2-11,Leonard>我们该怎么办  该打电话叫人来吗
<2-11,Leonard>What do we do? Should we call someone?

68
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,090
<2-12,Howard>告诉人家我们把所有设备都污染了吗
<2-12,Howard>And tell them that we compromised all the equipment?

69
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,060
<2-12,Howard>赶紧趁没人发现前把它赶出去
<2-12,Howard>Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.

70
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,230
<2-13,Leonard>好吧  我们该怎么抓它呢
<2-13,Leonard>Okay, how do we catch it?

71
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,410
<2-14,Howard>要不我们把所有灯关掉
<2-14,Howard>Well, what if we turn off all the lights

72
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,780
<2-14,Howard>只留下一盏灯  它就会飞过来
<2-14,Howard>except for one, and it'll come to it.

73
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,070
<2-15,Leonard>它又不是飞蛾
<2-15,Leonard>It's not a moth!

74
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,750
<2-16,Howard>别吼我
<2-16,Howard>Don't yell at me.

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,220
<2-16,Howard>你越吼我  我越想不出什么好主意
<2-16,Howard>You're not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you're yelling.

76
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,700
<2-17,Leonard>所以如果我保持平静
<2-17,Leonard>Okay, so if I remain calm,

77
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,940
<2-17,Leonard>我就能听到更多像"关灯"这样的绝妙大计吗
<2-17,Leonard>I'll get more gems like, "Turn off the lights"?!

78
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,780
<2-18,Howard>这下好了  我们反目成仇
<2-18,Howard>Great, we're turning on each other.

79
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,420
<2-18,Howard>正中了这只鸟的下怀
<2-18,Howard>That's just what the bird wants us to do!

80
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,190
<3-1,Penny>库萨帕里医生  飞了很久吧
<3-1,Penny>So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?

81
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,610
<3-3,Penny>-足足20小时  -很辛苦吧
<3-3,Penny>- 20 hours. - Oh, that's rough.

82
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,750
<3-4,Dr Koothrappali>完全不会
<3-4,Dr Koothrappali>Not at all.

83
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,740
<3-4,Dr Koothrappali>不用跟妻子一起飞这种跨大陆航班
<3-4,Dr Koothrappali>Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife,

84
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,440
<3-4,Dr Koothrappali>我也不用祈祷飞机赶紧坠机
<3-4,Dr Koothrappali>you don't pray for the plane to crash?

85
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,370
<3-5,Raj>我们能聊点别的吗
<3-5,Raj>Can you please talk about anything else?

86
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,710
<3-6,Dr Koothrappali>抱歉  原谅我
<3-6,Dr Koothrappali>Forgive me.

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,200
<3-6,Dr Koothrappali>你和莱纳德如何了
<3-6,Dr Koothrappali>How are you and Leonard?

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,890
<3-7,Penny>很好啊  一切都很好
<3-7,Penny>Oh, great. Everything's good.

89
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,560
<3-8,Dr Koothrappali>-我发现你们好像订婚了  -是啊
<3-8,Dr Koothrappali>- I see you got engaged. - Yes, we did.

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,920
<3-10,Dr Koothrappali>让我告诉你个故事
<3-10,Dr Koothrappali>Let me tell you a story.

91
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,900
<3-11,Raj>爸
<3-11,Raj>Dad!

92
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,370
<3-11,Raj>抱歉
<3-11,Raj>Sorry.

93
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,280
<3-12,Dr Koothrappali>我相信你们不会日渐憎恨彼此
<3-12,Dr Koothrappali>I'm sure you won't grow to hate each other.

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,190
<3-13,Raj (on phone)>莱纳德  怎么啦
<3-13,Raj (on phone)>Hey, Leonard. What's up?

95
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,700
<3-13,Raj (on phone)>什么  怎么会这样
<3-13,Raj (on phone)>What? How did that happen?

96
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,640
<3-13,Raj (on phone)>好吧  我尽快到
<3-13,Raj (on phone)>Yeah, okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.

97
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,200
<3-13,Raj (on phone)>抱歉我得去一下大学
<3-13,Raj (on phone)>Sorry. I have to run to the university.

98
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,280
<3-14,Amy>怎么了
<3-14,Amy>What's going on?

99
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,920
<3-15,Raj>我们的实验出了点问题
<3-15,Raj>There's been a problem with our experiment.

100
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,470
<3-15,Raj>有只鸟飞进了无尘室
<3-15,Raj>A bird got into the clean room.

101
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,950
<3-16,Dr Koothrappali>需要我去帮忙吗
<3-16,Dr Koothrappali>You want me to come?

102
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,470
<3-17,Raj>不用  你刚坐了这么长时间飞机
<3-17,Raj>Uh, no. You had a long flight.

103
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,090
<3-17,Raj>你就待着放松休息吧
<3-17,Raj>You stay here and relax.

104
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,420
<3-18,Dr Koothrappali>"放松"  你说得倒轻巧
<3-18,Dr Koothrappali>"Relax." Easy for you to say.

105
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,370
<3-18,Dr Koothrappali>你妈"清"空的又不是你的银行账户
<3-18,Dr Koothrappali>Your mother isn't cleaning out your bank account.

106
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,710
<3-18,Dr Koothrappali>40年来  这女人从未"清"理过任何东西
<3-18,Dr Koothrappali>40 years, the woman never cleaned a thing.

107
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,590
<3-19,Penny>你要把他丢在这里吗
<3-19,Penny>You're just gonna leave him here?

108
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,360
<3-20,Dr Koothrappali>-他还好意思让我放松  -是的  再见
<3-20,Dr Koothrappali>- "Relax," He says. - Yup. Bye.

<4-4,Sheldon>kissed Mommy

123
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,080
<4-4,Sheldon>然后《奶奶被驯鹿撞死了》
<4-4,Sheldon>and ran Grandma over with a reindeer.

124
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,620
<4-4,Sheldon>我有个酒鬼叔叔也会做这三件事啊
<4-4,Sheldon>I had a drunk uncle who did all those things.

125
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,050
<4-4,Sheldon>怎么没人唱歌歌颂他呢
<4-4,Sheldon>Nobody sings songs about him.

126
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,560
<4-5,Bernadette>如果你把圣诞老人看做是超级英雄
<4-5,Bernadette>Maybe you'd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,150
<4-5,Bernadette>有给孩子们带来欢乐的超能力  你会喜欢点
<4-5,Bernadette>and his power is bringing joy to children.

128
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,810
<4-6,Sheldon>我叔叔也这样啊  结果被指控了
<4-6,Sheldon>My uncle was accused of that, too.

129
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,800
<4-6,Sheldon>结果在俄州那是合法的
<4-6,Sheldon>It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.

130
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,470
<4-7,Bernadette>好吧  换个话题
<4-7,Bernadette>Okay, new subject.

131
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,900
<4-7,Bernadette>我们聊聊礼物吧
<4-7,Bernadette>Let's talk about presents.

132
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,530
<4-7,Bernadette>你要送艾米什么呀
<4-7,Bernadette>What did you get Amy?

133
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,710
<4-8,Sheldon>我们不会互送礼物
<4-8,Sheldon>Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.

134
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,420
<4-9,Bernadette>拜托  谢尔顿  送礼物给女朋友是一定要的啊
<4-9,Bernadette>Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.

135
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,740
<4-10,Sheldon>凭什么
<4-10,Sheldon>Why should I?

136
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
<4-10,Sheldon>她明知道我不喜欢圣诞节
<4-10,Sheldon>She knows that I don't like Christmas,

137
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,630
<4-10,Sheldon>可是每一年都强迫我一起庆祝
<4-10,Sheldon>and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it.

138
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,620
<4-10,Sheldon>不光是这次逼我参加白痴的圣诞晚餐
<4-10,Sheldon>Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will.

139
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,050
<4-10,Sheldon>之前在圣诞树卖场那  有一个槲寄生
<4-10,Sheldon>At the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe,

141
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,490
<4-10,Sheldon>她居然当众亲了我
<4-10,Sheldon>and she kissed me under it in public.

142
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,030
<4-10,Sheldon>我们就像墨西哥性爱秀的表演者
<4-10,Sheldon>Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.

143
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,600
<4-11,Bernadette>她只是对节日感到兴奋而已啦
<4-11,Bernadette>She's just excited about the holidays.

144
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,610
<4-12,Sheldon>是啊  而她完全不顾及我的感受
<4-12,Sheldon>Yes, and she's not taking my feelings into account at all.

145
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,160
<4-12,Sheldon>或许是时候给她点教训了
<4-12,Sheldon>Maybe it's time I teach her a lesson.

146
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,720
<4-13,Bernadette>怎么做
<4-13,Bernadette>How?

147
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,420
<4-14,Sheldon>一定要给她下点狠药
<4-14,Sheldon>It'd have to be something heinous,

148
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,090
<4-14,Sheldon>让她生不如死  就像她害我的那样
<4-14,Sheldon>something that makes her as miserable as she's making me.

149
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,590
<4-14,Sheldon>我想到了
<4-14,Sheldon>Oh, I've got it.

150
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,060
<4-14,Sheldon>这主意太好了
<4-14,Sheldon>This is good.

151
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,550
<4-15,Bernadette>是什么
<4-15,Bernadette>What?

152
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,380
<4-16,Sheldon>我要送她一份礼物
<4-16,Sheldon>I'm going to buy her a present.

153
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,870
<4-17,Bernadette>好吧  你得好好给我讲解一下
<4-17,Bernadette>Yeah, you're gonna have to walk me through that.

154
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,730
<4-18,Sheldon>礼品馈赠隐含了一种无形的社会契约
<4-18,Sheldon>With gift-giving, there's an implied social contract.

155
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,620
<4-18,Sheldon>如果我今晚带着礼物去她家
<4-18,Sheldon>If I show up tonight with a present,

156
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,150
<4-18,Sheldon>而她却没有为我准备礼物
<4-18,Sheldon>and she doesn't have one for me,

157
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,690
<4-18,Sheldon>那她就会内疚
<4-18,Sheldon>she'll feel terrible.

158
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,280
<4-19,Bernadette>然后你们俩都不开心
<4-19,Bernadette>Then you're both sad?

159
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,330
<4-19,Bernadette>是的
<4-19,Bernadette>Yes.

160
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,480
<4-20,Sheldon>或许她会内疚到
<4-20,Sheldon>Maybe she'll feel so guilty,

161
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,570
<4-20,Sheldon>永远都不想跟我一起庆祝节日
<4-20,Sheldon>she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again.

162
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,680
<4-21,Bernadette>所以你的邪恶阴谋是送你女朋友一份礼物吗
<4-21,Bernadette>So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?

163
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,150
<4-21,Bernadette>没错
<4-21,Bernadette>That's right.

164
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,420
<4-22,Sheldon>所以别惹我  否则小爷也会赐你点"礼物"
<4-22,Sheldon>So stay on my good side, or I'll get you a little something, too.

165
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,790
<5-1,Howard>好  计划是这样
<5-1,Howard>Okay, here's the plan.

166
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,630
<5-1,Howard>我把食物放进袋子里
<5-1,Howard>I'm gonna put the food in the bag,

167
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,060
<5-1,Howard>一旦鸽子飞进去吃  我们就赶紧把口封死
<5-1,Howard>and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.

168
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,970
<5-2,Leonard>一根肉条吗
<5-2,Leonard>A Slim Jim?

169
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,550
<5-3,Howard>只有这个了  保证管用
<5-3,Howard>It's all I could find. It'll work.

170
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,160
<5-4,Leonard>屁咧
<5-4,Leonard>Sure.

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,910
<5-4,Leonard>除非它嗑药了  或者它是卡车司机
<5-4,Leonard>If the pigeon's stoned or a trucker.

173
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,880
<5-5,Howard>好吧  那你的计划是什么
<5-5,Howard>Okay, well, what's your plan?

174
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,040
<5-6,Leonard>我之前不是说了吗
<5-6,Leonard>I told you my plan.

175
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,020
<5-6,Leonard>打给物业管理处  找人帮忙啊
<5-6,Leonard>Let's call Building Services and get help.

176
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,040
<5-7,Howard>承认我们污染了无尘室吗
<5-7,Howard>And admit that we contaminated the clean room?

177
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,910
<5-8,Leonard>不  是承认你污染了无尘室
<5-8,Leonard>No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.

178
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,520
<5-9,Howard>为什么你总认为责任在我
<5-9,Howard>Why do you keep assuming it was me?

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,530
<5-10,Leonard>因为你总犯这样的错误
<5-10,Leonard>Because you do this kind of thing all the time,

180
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,370
<5-10,Leonard>还会试图掩盖事实
<5-10,Leonard>and then you try to cover it up.

181
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,440
<5-11,Howard>比如说
<5-11,Howard>Like when?

182
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,560
<5-12,Leonard>比如说你把火星漫游者玩坏
<5-12,Leonard>What about when you flipped the Mars Rover,

183
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,080
<5-12,Leonard>弄丢了库萨帕里的狗
<5-12,Leonard>or lost Koothrappali's dog,

184
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,740
<5-12,Leonard>差点开别人的车带着别人的娃走了
<5-12,Leonard>or almost drove off with that baby?

185
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,410
<5-13,Howard>重申一遍  那车跟我的车很像  而且那娃没哭
<5-13,Howard>Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn't even cry

186
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,420
<5-13,Howard>是后来他妈用钥匙打我才吓哭的
<5-13,Howard>until his mother punched me with her keys.

187
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,930
<5-14,Leonard>行  你想把肉条放垃圾袋里就放呗
<5-14,Leonard>Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.

188
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,260
<5-15,Howard>你能不能讲话不这么秀优越感
<5-15,Howard>Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?

189
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,080
<5-16,Leonard>我尽量  但你的计划里有
<5-16,Leonard>I can try, but your plan has the words

190
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,840
<5-16,Leonard>"垃圾袋"和"肉条"这两个词
<5-16,Leonard>"Garbage bag" and "Slim Jim" in it!

191
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,970
<5-17,Raj>什么情况
<5-17,Raj>Hey, what's going on?

192
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,560
<5-18,Leonard>有一个天才想用一个垃圾袋
<5-18,Leonard>Genius here wants to catch a bird

193
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,970
<5-18,Leonard>和一根肉条抓住一只鸟
<5-18,Leonard>with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.

194
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,850
<5-19,Raj>真应该先放进袋子里
<5-19,Raj>Should have put it in the bag first.

195
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,440
<6-1,Penny>希望你别介意我多嘴
<6-1,Penny>So, if you don't mind me asking,

196
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,400
<6-1,Penny>你认为你会开始跟其他人约会吗
<6-1,Penny>do you think you might start dating again?

197
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,900
<6-2,Dr Koothrappali>现在说这个还太早吧
<6-2,Dr Koothrappali>It's much too soon for that.

198
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,380
<6-2,Dr Koothrappali>怎么了  要给我介绍对象吗
<6-2,Dr Koothrappali>Why? Do you know someone?

199
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,890
<6-3,Penny>没有啦  但如果我和莱纳德闹掰了
<6-3,Penny>No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard,

200
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,460
<6-3,Penny>我会打给你的
<6-3,Penny>I'll give you a call.

201
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,900
<6-3,Penny>等等  你会经常大聊特聊《星际迷航》吗
<6-3,Penny>Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?

202
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,230
<6-4,Amy>好啦  我们维多利亚式派对开始啦
<6-4,Amy>Okay, let's get this Victorian party started.

203
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,370
<6-4,Amy>我做了些研究
<6-4,Amy>I've done some research

204
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,840
<6-4,Amy>找了几个我们可以玩的会客厅游戏
<6-4,Amy>about some traditional parlor games we can play.

205
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
<6-5,Penny>比如什么
<6-5,Penny>Like what?

206
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,230
<6-6,Amy>有一个有趣的游戏叫"羊毛球"
<6-6,Amy>Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool.

207
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,300
<6-6,Amy>你拿一个羊毛球
<6-6,Amy>You take a ball of wool,

208
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,110
<6-6,Amy>放在桌子的正中间
<6-6,Amy>and you put it right in the center of the table.

209
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,310
<6-6,Amy>然后让桌子两端的人
<6-6,Amy>Then people sit on opposite sides of the table

210
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,690
<6-6,Amy>来回吹毛球
<6-6,Amy>and try to blow the wool off.

211
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,580
<6-7,Penny>抱歉  她也有男友了
<6-7,Penny>Sorry. She's taken, too.

212
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,340
<7-1,Howard>你知道我觉得你问题在哪吗
<7-1,Howard>You know what I think your problem is?

213
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,310
<7-1,Howard>你嫉妒
<7-1,Howard>You're jealous

214
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,470
<7-1,Howard>因为你曾经是我最好的朋友
<7-1,Howard>because you and I used to be best friends

215
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,760
<7-1,Howard>现在库萨帕里插进来了
<7-1,Howard>until Koothrappali came along.

216
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,110
<7-2,Leonard>于是你终于找到可以任你摆布的人了
<7-2,Leonard>And you found somebody you could push around?

217
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,510
<7-4,Howard>-你别掺合  -好的
<7-4,Howard>- Stay out of this. - Okay.

218
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,880
<7-6,Howard>也许拉杰之所以能成为我最好的朋友
<7-6,Howard>You know, maybe I'm best friends with Raj

219
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,470
<7-6,Howard>是因为他不会觉得自己比我聪明
<7-6,Howard>because he doesn't think he's smarter than me.

220
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,740
<7-8,Howard>-其实...  -我说你别掺合
<7-8,Howard>- Actually... - I said, stay out of it!

221
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,320
<7-9,Leonard>别别  拉杰你说  你刚刚想说什么
<7-9,Leonard>N-No. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.

222
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,500
<7-9,Leonard>我只想说
<7-9,Leonard>All I'm gonna say is

223
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,630
<7-10,Raj>你们别再吵了
<7-10,Raj>you guys need to stop this right now.

224
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,300
<7-10,Raj>我父母闹矛盾已经够糟了
<7-10,Raj>It-It's bad enough that my parents are fighting,

225
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,280
<7-10,Raj>现在还要听你俩吵架
<7-10,Raj>now I have to hear the two of you?

226
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,060
<7-10,Raj>谁在乎谁更聪明啊
<7-10,Raj>And who cares who's smarter?

227
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,820
<7-10,Raj>谁管是莱纳德还是我  还是...
<7-10,Raj>If it's Leonard or me or...

228
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,540
<7-10,Raj>算了  大过节的  霍华德最聪明吧
<7-10,Raj>you know, it's Christmas, let's say it's Howard.

229
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,710
<7-11,Howard>既然你那么聪明  你把鸟赶出去啊
<7-11,Howard>Well, if you're so smart, you get the bird out.

230
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,220
<7-12,Raj>不  是你放进来的
<7-12,Raj>No, you're the one who let him in.

231
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,040
<7-13,Howard>你怎么知道不是莱纳德
<7-13,Howard>How do you know it wasn't Leonard?

232
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,150
<7-14,Raj>得了吧
<7-14,Raj>Come on.

233
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,280
<8-1,Bernadette>那件毛衣怎么样
<8-1,Bernadette>What about that sweater?

234
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,020
<8-2,Sheldon>不行  不够好
<8-2,Sheldon>No, it's not good enough.

235
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,090
<8-2,Sheldon>必须要完美
<8-2,Sheldon>It has to be perfect.

236
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,060
<8-3,Bernadette>我觉得华仔送我最棒的礼物是一份
<8-3,Bernadette>I think the nicest gifts I've got from Howie

237
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,170
<8-3,Bernadette>体现了他有多了解我的礼物
<8-3,Bernadette>show how well he knows me.

238
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,830
<8-4,Sheldon>我想想  我了解艾米什么

<8-4,Sheldon>我爱看她会随着听到的竖琴声舞动手指
<8-4,Sheldon>I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance

243
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,320
<8-4,Sheldon>仿佛一同弹奏
<8-4,Sheldon>as if she's playing along.

244
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,510
<8-5,Bernadette>你真的很爱她

248
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,110
<9-1,Amy>你赢啦
<9-1,Amy>You won!

249
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,320
<9-2,Penny>一点胜利的喜悦都没有  对吧
<9-2,Penny>Certainly doesn't feel like it, does it?

250

<9-3,Dr Koothrappali>我老婆以前总喜欢办这种主题派对
<9-3,Dr Koothrappali>You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.

<9-4,Penny>拉杰大概就是从那学的吧
<9-4,Penny>Oh, I guess that's where Raj gets it from.

<10-1,Santa>逼你过圣诞节
<10-1,Santa>for making you celebrate Christmas?

263
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,250
<10-2,Sheldon>正确
<10-2,Sheldon>Correct.

264
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,170
<10-3,Santa>圣诞老人觉得有你这种男友已经够受罪了
<10-3,Santa>Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.

265
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,220
<10-4,Sheldon>这话不无道理
<10-4,Sheldon>There's an argument for that.

266
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,240
<10-4,Sheldon>但我得确保她一定受到惩罚

<11-1,Leonard>拉杰你把门帘掀开让它可以飞出去
<11-1,Leonard>Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.

<11-2,Howard>你确定我这样的傻蛋可以应付
<11-2,Howard>Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something

274
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,950
<11-2,Howard>毯子这么复杂的东西吗
<11-2,Howard>as complicated as a blanket?

275
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,800
<11-3,Leonard>你想负责灭火器吗

<11-8,Leonard>现在怀念毯子了吧
<11-8,Leonard>You miss the blanket now, don't you?

<11-11,Howard>天啊  我的天啊
<11-11,Howard>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

<11-12,Leonard>别紧张  不是你的错
<11-12,Leonard>Relax, it wasn't your fault.

288
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,880
<11-13,Howard>它可能只是吓呆了
<11-13,Howard>Uh, maybe it's just stunned.

289
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,210
<11-14,Raj>兄弟  呼吸都没了
<11-14,Raj>Dude, I-it's not breathing.

<11-22,Howard>I need to do it.

306
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,520
<11-22,Howard>这是我的责任
<11-22,Howard>This is on me.

<11-23,Leonard>"以嘴覆盖于喙  轻轻胸部挤压"
<11-23,Leonard>"Mouth over beak and light chest compressions."

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,910
<11-24,Raj>别吹得太狠了
<11-24,Raj>Don't blow too hard.

<11-24,Raj>你把它吹炸了  我会吐的
<11-24,Raj>If you pop him, I will vomit.

311
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,320
<11-25,Leonard>有发现吗
<11-25,Leonard>Anything?

312

<11-26,Howard>我尝到好浓的肉条味
<11-26,Howard>I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.

313
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,780
<11-27,Leonard>等等   它的翅膀动了
<11-27,Leonard>Wait, wait, his wing moved!

314
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,560
<11-28,Howard>它眨眼睛了  它活过来了
<11-28,Howard>Oh, he blinked his eyes! He's alive!

315
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,120
<11-29,Raj>这真是圣诞节奇迹啊
<11-29,Raj>It's a Christmas miracle!

316
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,440
<11-30,Howard>对我来说是光明节奇迹  不过圣诞节也不错
<11-30,Howard>I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I'll take it.

318
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,130
<11-30,Howard>来吧小家伙  我们放你出去  把帘子拉开
<11-30,Howard>Come on, little guy, let's get you outside. Get the curtain.

<11-31,Raj>有人真应该去关上外门
<11-31,Raj>Someone should really close that loading door.

320
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,870
<12-1,Raj>事情只能这样了
<12-1,Raj>Well, that's that.

321
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,410
<12-1,Raj>这个房间已经被污染了
<12-1,Raj>The room's compromised.

322

<12-1,Raj>所有的滤网都得换掉
<12-1,Raj>They'll have to change all the filters,

00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,040
<12-1,Raj>可能得关闭好几周呢
<12-1,Raj>probably shut it down for weeks.

324
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,200
<12-2,Howard>你说得对  打电话给管理处吧
<12-2,Howard>You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services.

325
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,790
<12-2,Howard>-就说是我的错  -不  我俩都有错
<12-2,Howard>- Tell them it was my fault. - No, we're both to blame.

<12-3,Leonard>这次就让我承担吧
<12-3,Leonard>You know, let me take the heat on this one.

<12-4,Raj>好吧  别扯到我头上就行
<12-4,Raj>Yeah, just leave me out of it.

328
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,150
<12-4,Raj>如果他们进来看到满地便便
<12-4,Raj>You know if they come here and see crap everywhere,

329
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,590
<12-4,Raj>肯定马上怪在印度人头上
<12-4,Raj>they're just gonna blame the Indian guy.

330
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,960
<12-5,Leonard (on phone)>抱歉  我们还在实验室
<12-5,Leonard (on phone)>Hey. I'm sorry, we're still here.

<12-5,Leonard (on phone)>你那里还好吧
<12-5,Leonard (on phone)>Is everything okay?

332
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,500
<12-6,Penny>有点无聊
<12-6,Penny>It's kind of boring.

333
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,970
<12-6,Penny>虽然艾米误吸进一个羊毛球时
<12-6,Penny>Although it did get exciting for a minute

334
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,360
<12-6,Penny>我稍微开心了一分钟
<12-6,Penny>when Amy inhaled a wool ball.

335
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,060
<12-6,Penny>你们还要多久才能来啊
<12-6,Penny>How much longer do you think you'll be?

336
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,900
<12-6,Penny>我不知道
<12-6,Penny>I don't know.

337
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,430
<12-7,Leonard>又进来了一只鸟
<12-7,Leonard>There's still a bird in here.

<14-4,Sheldon>如果是这样  那就变得"超美味"呢
<14-4,Sheldon>Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.

354
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,410
<14-5,Bernadette>你还好吧  你都没怎么吃鹅肉
<14-5,Bernadette>You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.

355
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,200
<14-6,Howard>闻起来太像冠蓝鸦了
<14-6,Howard>It smelled too much like blue jay.

356
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,110
<14-7,Dr Koothrappali>我帮你收拾吧
<14-7,Dr Koothrappali>Can I help you clean up?

357
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,970
<14-8,Amy>你用海姆力克法帮我咳出了羊毛球
<14-8,Amy>Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me;

358
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,210
<14-8,Amy>就不麻烦你了
<14-8,Amy>you're good.

359
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,200
<14-9,Sheldon>我们开始交换礼物吧
<14-9,Sheldon>Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?

360
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,630
<14-10,Penny>谢尔顿  我们没带礼物啊
<14-10,Penny>Oh, Sheldon, we didn't bring any.

361
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,160
<14-11,Leonard>我以为你讨厌交换礼物呢
<14-11,Leonard>I thought you hate giving gifts.

362
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,050
<14-11,Leonard>我是讨厌
<14-11,Leonard>Yeah, I do.

363
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,620
<14-12,Sheldon>所以我才给艾米带了这个
<14-12,Sheldon>Which is why I got Amy this.

364
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,410
<14-13,Amy>你给我带了礼物吗
<14-13,Amy>You got me something?

365
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,830
<14-14,Sheldon>不  不止是礼物
<14-14,Sheldon>Oh, not just something, no.

366
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,580
<14-14,Sheldon>我这是用心挑选的  节日主题的
<14-14,Sheldon>It's from the heart, it's holiday-themed,

367
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,910
<14-14,Sheldon>收据被我吃了  所以你也没法退了
<14-14,Sheldon>and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.

368
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,620
<14-15,Amy>看看你坐在圣诞老人腿上的样子
<14-15,Amy>Look at you on Santa's lap.

369
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,970
<14-15,Amy>真是太可爱了
<14-15,Amy>That's so sweet.

370
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,090
<14-16,Sheldon>那当然  这礼物可完美呢
<14-16,Sheldon>Of course it is. It's the perfect gift.

371
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,760
<14-16,Sheldon>你现在有什么感想
<14-16,Sheldon>H-How are you feeling right now?

372
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,340
<14-16,Sheldon>是否有罪恶感  悲哀感
<14-16,Sheldon>Guilty? Sad?

373
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,160
<14-16,Sheldon>宁愿自己是不过圣诞的犹太人吗
<14-16,Sheldon>Wishing you were Jewish?

374
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,380
<14-17,Amy>不  我非常喜欢
<14-17,Amy>No, I love it.

375
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,660
<14-18,Sheldon>真的吗
<14-18,Sheldon>Oh, really?

376
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,510
<14-18,Sheldon>那这个怎么样呢

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,950
<14-18,Sheldon>像我珍惜你那样
<14-18,Sheldon>as much as I treasure you.

380
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,930
<14-18,Sheldon>但是你都没为我准备礼物
<14-18,Sheldon>And you got me nothing.

381
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,130
<14-18,Sheldon>圣诞节被你毁了
<14-18,Sheldon>Christmas is ruined.

382
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,790
<14-18,Sheldon>我们再也不要提这件事了
<14-18,Sheldon>Let's never speak of it again.

383
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,250
<14-18,Sheldon>哇  这还真好玩
<14-18,Sheldon>Well, this was fun.

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,130
<14-19,Amy>我为你准备了一份礼物
<14-19,Amy>I did get you something.

386
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,520
<14-20,Sheldon>我们不是有协议吗
<14-20,Sheldon>But what about our agreement?

387
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,480
<14-21,Amy>可你也送了我礼物啊  给你
<14-21,Amy>Well, you got me something. Here.

388
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,350
<14-22,Sheldon>饼干吗

<14-23,Amy>是你外婆的圣诞饼干哦
<14-23,Amy>They're your Meemaw's Christmas cookies.

<14-26,Sheldon>我真不敢相信
<14-26,Sheldon>I can't believe this.

<14-26,Sheldon>你开心  我也开心
<14-26,Sheldon>You're happy, I'm happy.

396
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,630
<14-26,Sheldon>也许一个强调馈赠的节日并不是那么...
<14-26,Sheldon>Well, maybe a holiday that's all about giving isn't so...

397
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,550
<14-26,Sheldon>拿开你的脏爪
<14-26,Sheldon>Get your hand out of that box!

398
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,740

<15-1,Amy>下一个游戏叫做寻找热豆豆
<15-1,Amy>The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.

400
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,060
<15-2,Penny>我猜也是
<15-2,Penny>Of course it is.

401
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,910
<15-3,Amy>选一个人离开房间
<15-3,Amy>One person is sent out of the room

402
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,580
<15-3,Amy>其他人留在里面藏起一个小玩意
<15-3,Amy>while the others hide a small item.

403
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,750
<15-3,Amy>然后对外面的人说
<15-3,Amy>Then they invite the first person back by saying,

404
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,770
<15-3,Amy>"晚餐已煮好  热豆加培根
<15-3,Amy>"Hot boiled beans and bacon for supper,

405
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,570
<15-3,Amy>快快进屋里  趁热找到它"
<15-3,Amy>hurry up before it gets cold."

406
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,550
<15-4,Raj>如果你们觉得这比汤姆·汉克斯感恩节好玩
<15-4,Raj>If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving,

407
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,620
<15-4,Raj>我也是醉了
