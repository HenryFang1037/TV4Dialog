1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,710
<1-1,Sheldon>看到你平安到达我就放心了
<1-1,Sheldon>I'm glad to see you made it safely

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,360
<1-1,Sheldon>酒店怎么样
<1-1,Sheldon>How's your hotel?

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,320
<1-2,Amy (on Skype)>虽然不是我住过的最佳"最佳西方酒店"
<1-2,Amy (on Skype)>It's not the best Best Western I've been to,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
<1-2,Amy (on Skype)>但算得上
<1-2,Amy (on Skype)>but I'd say it's...

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,360
<1-2,Amy (on Skype)>我住过的第三佳"最佳西方酒店"吧
<1-2,Amy (on Skype)>the third best Best Western I've been to.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,910
<1-3,Sheldon>我懂你的感觉
<1-3,Sheldon>I know how you feel.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,600
<1-3,Sheldon>我家附近的百思买[最值买]也只是第三值
<1-3,Sheldon>The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,150
<1-3,Sheldon>它的确有最值买的东西
<1-3,Sheldon>They have the best buys,

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,140
<1-3,Sheldon>但光有最值买的东西并不足以
<1-3,Sheldon>but having the best buys isn't the only thing

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,190
<1-4,Amy>让一家"最值买"荣登最值的"最值买"
<1-4,Amy>that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,340
<1-4,Amy>那最值"最值买"怎么样才能担起这头衔呢
<1-4,Amy>What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,110
<1-5,Sheldon>这问题问得好
<1-5,Sheldon>Mm, that's a great question.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,720
<1-5,Sheldon>我喜欢它们开在墨西哥快餐店旁
<1-5,Sheldon>I like when they're next to a Chipotle.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,870
<1-6,Amy>好了  我该去把行李拿出来了
<1-6,Amy>Okay, well, I should unpack.

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,690
<1-7,Sheldon>好的
<1-7,Sheldon>All right.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,820
<1-7,Sheldon>好好享受神经生物学大会吧
<1-7,Sheldon>Enjoy the neurobiology conference.

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,880
<1-8,Amy>我会的
<1-8,Amy>I will.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,690
<1-8,Amy>我...  真希望你也在这里
<1-8,Amy>I... wish you were here.

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,650
<1-9,Sheldon>参加神经生物学大会吗
<1-9,Sheldon>At a neurobiology conference?

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,910
<1-9,Sheldon>这话也太损了吧
<1-9,Sheldon>What a mean thing to say.

21
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,670
<1-10,Amy>好吧  那我很庆幸你不在这里呢
<1-10,Amy>Okay, I'm glad you're not here?

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,500
<1-11,Sheldon>真好  每次只要我一教
<1-11,Sheldon>Aw, you always know just what to say

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,770
<1-11,Sheldon>你就会把话说到我心坎里
<1-11,Sheldon>after I tell you what to say.

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,900
<1-12,Amy>再见啦  谢尔顿
<1-12,Amy>Good-bye, Sheldon.

25
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,070

28
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,310
<1-13,Sheldon>这就代表你们有荣幸能娱乐本皇
<1-13,Sheldon>which means I'm available to be entertained, hmm.

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,010
<1-13,Sheldon>也就是现在年轻人说的
<1-13,Sheldon>As today's youth might put it:

30
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,670
<1-13,Sheldon>谁有兴趣来"谢"主隆恩啊
<1-13,Sheldon>Who wants to get their Sheld-on?

<1-14,Howard>我跟妮妮要为家里的重新装修做准备
<1-14,Howard>Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel.

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,090
<1-14,Howard>我们很乐意有你来帮忙
<1-14,Howard>We could always use an extra pair of hands.

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,200

<1-15,Sheldon>That sounds awful. Raj?

<1-17,Sheldon>That's the one to beat. Leonard?

38
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,640
<1-18,Leonard>你别来烦我就"谢"天谢地了
<1-18,Leonard>Oh, if anything, I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.

<1-20,Raj>Well, I should warn you, it's just looking at data

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,310
<1-20,Raj>看好几小时的数据而已
<1-20,Raj>for hours and hours on a computer screen.

<1-21,Sheldon>已经选你  别再诱惑我了
<1-21,Sheldon>Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.

53
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,580
<2-4,Howard>今天好吗
<2-4,Howard>How was your day?

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,670
<2-5,Leonard>不太好
<2-5,Leonard>Oh, not good.

55
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,640
<2-6,Penny>还是没能见到加洛医生
<2-6,Penny>Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.

56
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,120
<2-7,Sheldon>医生吗
<2-7,Sheldon>A doctor?

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,700
<2-7,Sheldon>你的病可别有传染性啊
<2-7,Sheldon>Well, I hope you're not contagious.

<2-7,Sheldon>我这周末要去太空望远镜控制室
<2-7,Sheldon>I've got a weekend in the telescope room

59
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,990
<2-7,Sheldon>我可是为此兴奋了将近有三分钟呢
<2-7,Sheldon>I've been excited about for almost three minutes.

60
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,900
<2-8,Penny>我没生病  是工作啦
<2-8,Penny>I'm not sick. It's for work.

61
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,590
<2-8,Penny>有一个医生拒绝见任何医药销售员
<2-8,Penny>There's this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps.

62
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,990
<2-8,Penny>我试着要见这医生好几个月了
<2-8,Penny>I've been trying to get in for months.

63
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,250
<2-9,Leonard>你有穿那件
<2-9,Leonard>Well, did you try wearing the shirt

64
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,110
<2-9,Leonard>我说上班穿太骚的衣服试试吗
<2-9,Leonard>I said was inappropriate for work?

65
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,540
<2-10,Penny>那是个女医生  不过...
<2-10,Penny>Well, the doctor's a woman, but...

66
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,080
<2-10,Penny>穿了  毕竟"直弯"试过才知道
<2-10,Penny>yes, because you never know.

67
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,440
<2-11,Howard>她是什么医生
<2-11,Howard>What kind of doctor is she?

68
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,180
<2-12,Penny>精神科医生  怎么了
<2-12,Penny>Um, a psychiatrist. Why?

69
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,810
<2-13,Howard>那你假装自己是病人去预约呢
<2-13,Howard>Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient?

70
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,150
<2-13,Howard>那你就有机会跟她谈啦
<2-13,Howard>Then you'll get to talk to her.

71
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,580
<2-14,Penny>他们已经知道我是医药销售员了
<2-14,Penny>Yeah, they already know I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.

72
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,730
<2-15,Raj>那如果是莱纳德假装病人去预约
<2-15,Raj>Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment

73
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,690
<2-15,Raj>先帮你铺好路呢
<2-15,Raj>and tried to lay some groundwork for you?

74
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,250
<2-16,Penny>这个主意有意思
<2-16,Penny>That's interesting.

75
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,960
<2-17,Leonard>我才不要假装病人去看精神科医生
<2-17,Leonard>I'm not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist.

76
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,320
<2-17,Leonard>我要假装有啥毛病呢
<2-17,Leonard>What would I say is wrong with me?

79
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,680
<2-21,Leonard>你们说得都不是真的
<2-21,Leonard>None of that is true.

80
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,490
<2-22,Penny>否认现实  亲爱的  毛病多得很啊
<2-22,Penny>Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.

81
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,290
<2-23,Leonard>这也太扯了吧
<2-23,Leonard>That's just crazy.

82
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,910
<2-23,Leonard>我去了对你有什么帮助啊
<2-23,Leonard>How would my going in there even help you?

83
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,390
<2-24,Penny>不知道啊  你可以跟她聊天  谈到药时
<2-24,Penny>I don't know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up,

84
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,930
<2-24,Penny>就顺势问问她有没听过我公司的药
<2-24,Penny>you could ask if she's heard about the drug.

85
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,090
<2-25,Leonard>万一被抓到怎么办

88
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,400
<2-29,Leonard>行  我去
<2-29,Leonard>Fine, I'll do it.

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,530
<2-29,Leonard>但不是因为他们的话  是因为我爱你
<2-29,Leonard>But not because of them, because I love you.

90
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,310
<2-30,Penny>谢谢

93
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,550
<3-1,Howard>真是爽翻天了
<3-1,Howard>That was incredible.

94
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,240
<3-2,Bernadette>的确
<3-2,Bernadette>It was.

95
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,910
<3-2,Bernadette>要是斯图尔特不在就更好了
<3-2,Bernadette>I just wish Stuart wasn't around

96
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,190
<3-2,Bernadette>我们想多大声就能多大声
<3-2,Bernadette>so we didn't have to be so quiet.

97
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,210
<3-2,Bernadette>对啊
<3-2,Bernadette>I know.

98
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,970
<3-3,Howard>而且这家伙看日本色情动画时
<3-3,Howard>It's not like he returns the favor

99
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,190
<3-3,Howard>也不知放大声点回报咱们
<3-3,Howard>when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.

100
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,680
<3-4,Stuart (knocking)>你们俩有空吗

<3-5,Howard>有事吗  斯图尔特
<3-5,Howard>What is it, Stuart?

105
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,280

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,630

<3-11,Stuart>so I thought I'd make it easy on you guys

111
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,780
<3-11,Stuart>就出去找房子
<3-11,Stuart>and find my own place.

112
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,640
<3-12,Howard>我真没想到今晚能"好事"成双啊
<3-12,Howard>I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.

113
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,260
<3-13,Bernadette>所以你计划什么时候搬
<3-13,Bernadette>So, when are you thinking of moving?

114
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,260
<3-14,Stuart>其实我已经找好一间公寓了
<3-14,Stuart>Uh, actually, I already found an apartment,

<3-15,Bernadette>好吧

<4-1,Sheldon>你在干嘛
<4-1,Sheldon>What are you doing?

<4-2,Raj>确保望远镜的摄像机白场已平衡
<4-2,Raj>Uh, making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.

125
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,650
<4-3,Sheldon>那现在呢
<4-3,Sheldon>What are you doing now?

126
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,480
<4-4,Raj>还在确保望远镜的摄像机
<4-4,Raj>Still making sure the telescope's camera

127
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,620
<4-4,Raj>白场已平衡
<4-4,Raj>is white-field balanced.

128
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,970
<4-5,Sheldon>了解
<4-5,Sheldon>Oh, I see.

129
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,840
<4-5,Sheldon>那现在呢
<4-5,Sheldon>How about now?

130
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,650
<4-5,Sheldon>现在在确保望远镜的摄像机白场已平衡
<4-5,Sheldon>Now I'm making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced

131
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,450
<4-6,Raj>以及后悔你没有一本彩色填色本
<4-6,Raj>and wishing you had a coloring book.

132
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,670
<4-7,Sheldon>我可以帮上忙啊
<4-7,Sheldon>Well, I can be helpful.

133
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,020
<4-7,Sheldon>给我点事情做做嘛
<4-7,Sheldon>Give me something to do.

134
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,820
<4-7,Sheldon>告诉你  有一次我爹带我去上班
<4-7,Sheldon>You know, my father took me to work once,

135
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,280
<4-7,Sheldon>才十分钟我就发现了
<4-7,Sheldon>and in ten minutes I figured out

136
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,110
<4-7,Sheldon>到底是谁从收银机里偷钱
<4-7,Sheldon>who'd been stealing from the cash register.

137
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,930
<4-7,Sheldon>就是我爹
<4-7,Sheldon>It was my father.

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,260
<4-7,Sheldon>我爹丢了工作
<4-7,Sheldon>Yeah, Dad lost his job,

139
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,450
<4-7,Sheldon>但是他老板给了我根软糖冰棒
<4-7,Sheldon>but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.

140
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,980
<4-8,Raj>行  你想要来点事做是吧
<4-8,Raj>Fine, you want something to do?

141
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,810
<4-8,Raj>这硬盘里有搜集了大约六个月的数据
<4-8,Raj>There's about six months of data on this hard drive.

142
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,690
<4-8,Raj>你何不过一遍这些数据  看能否发现
<4-8,Raj>Why don't you go through it and see if you can spot

143
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,350
<4-8,Raj>有任何规律或异常呢
<4-8,Raj>any patterns or anomalies.

144
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,540
<4-9,Sheldon>好的  我这就去
<4-9,Sheldon>Yep, I'm on it.

145
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,530
<4-9,Sheldon>你看我们
<4-9,Sheldon>Hey, look at that!

146
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,430
<4-9,Sheldon>印度阿三把电脑工作外包给白人佬
<4-9,Sheldon>An Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.

147
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,620
<4-10,Raj>随便怎么样
<4-10,Raj>Yeah, okay, whatever it takes

148
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,740
<4-10,Raj>只要能让你忙个数小时就行了
<4-10,Raj>to keep you busy for a few hours.

149
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,140
<4-11,Sheldon>找到一个
<4-11,Sheldon>Found one.

150
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,310
<4-12,Raj>不可能
<4-12,Raj>No, you didn't.

151
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,680
<4-12,Raj>那有好几百万数据点呢
<4-12,Raj>There are millions of data points there.

152
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,460
<4-13,Sheldon>可是你看  一个光学瞬态
<4-13,Sheldon>But, look, an optical transient.

153
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,340
<4-14,Raj>好吧  可能真的有东西
<4-14,Raj>Yeah, maybe that is something.

154
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,430
<4-14,Raj>-你怎么发现的  -其实不难啦
<4-14,Raj>- How did you find that? - It wasn't difficult.

155
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,510
<4-15,Sheldon>就像质数在你眼里自动就是红色的
<4-15,Sheldon>You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red,

156
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,900
<4-15,Sheldon>孪生质数是粉红色
<4-15,Sheldon>but when they're twin primes,

157
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,730
<4-15,Sheldon>而且闻起来像汽油  你懂我的意思吗
<4-15,Sheldon>they're pink and smell like gasoline?

158
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,930
<4-16,Raj>不懂
<4-16,Raj>No.

159
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,910
<4-17,Sheldon>可能我与众不同吧
<4-17,Sheldon>I guess I'm a special boy.

160
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,900
<4-17,Sheldon>有时候当一个男孩与众不同
<4-17,Sheldon>You know, sometimes when a boy is special,

161
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,870
<4-17,Sheldon>他会得到一根软糖冰棒
<4-17,Sheldon>he gets a Fudgsicle.

162
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,480
<4-17,Sheldon>而且味道尝起来像光速
<4-17,Sheldon>Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.

163
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,470
<5-1,Leonard>非常感谢你能临时抽空见我
<5-1,Leonard>Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

164
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,830
<5-2,Dr Gallo>乐意效劳
<5-2,Dr Gallo>Ah, it's my pleasure.

165
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,300
<5-2,Dr Gallo>我很好奇
<5-2,Dr Gallo>I'm curious,

166
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,600
<5-2,Dr Gallo>你和贝弗莉·霍斯塔特博士是亲戚吗
<5-2,Dr Gallo>are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?

167
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,100
<5-3,Leonard>她是我母亲  你认识她吗
<5-3,Leonard>Uh, she's my mother. You know her?

168
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,390
<5-4,Dr Gallo>不  不认识本人
<5-4,Dr Gallo>No, not personally,

169
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,500
<5-4,Dr Gallo>但我读过她所有的书
<5-4,Dr Gallo>but I have read all of her books.

170
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,840
<5-5,Leonard>那你对她的认识比我还深
<5-5,Leonard>Well, then you know her better than I do.

171
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,740
<5-6,Dr Gallo>不见得
<5-6,Dr Gallo>Well, I'm not so sure about that.

172
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,570
<5-6,Dr Gallo>但我可以告诉你
<5-6,Dr Gallo>But I can tell you I do not agree

173
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,720
<5-6,Dr Gallo>我完全不同意她育儿的那套理论
<5-6,Dr Gallo>with her theories on child rearing at all.

174
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,970
<5-6,Dr Gallo>是咩
<5-6,Dr Gallo>Really?

175
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,440
<5-7,Leonard>你是不是觉得那一套过于冷漠残酷
<5-7,Leonard>Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,180
<5-7,Leonard>并不适合天真无邪  想快乐生活的小男生
<5-7,Leonard>for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?

177
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,260
<5-8,Dr Gallo>我不想妄加评论
<5-8,Dr Gallo>Well, I didn't want to say it...

178
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,050
<5-9,Leonard>不不  请评论  唱出来
<5-9,Leonard>No, no, say it. Sing it.

179
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,510
<5-9,Leonard>租一架飞机  写在天空
<5-9,Leonard>Rent a plane, write it in the sky.

180
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,630
<5-10,Dr Gallo>听起来你对她
<5-10,Dr Gallo>Sounds like you're holding on

181
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,520
<5-10,Dr Gallo>一直心怀怨念  怒气满满啊
<5-10,Dr Gallo>to quite a bit of anger towards her.

182
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,440
<5-11,Leonard>不  我已经努力克服不少怨念
<5-11,Leonard>Oh, no, I-I've worked through a lot of that stuff;

183
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,220
<5-12,Dr Gallo>-现在好多了  -那就好
<5-12,Dr Gallo>- I'm better now. - Good for you.

184
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,420
<5-13,Leonard>你知道她从不让我庆祝自己的生日
<5-13,Leonard>Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday

185
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,550
<5-13,Leonard>就因为我的出生是她的成就  不是我自己的吗
<5-13,Leonard>because being born was her achievement, not mine?

186
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,590
<5-14,Dr Gallo>真是让人心碎
<5-14,Dr Gallo>That's heartbreaking.

187
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,540
<5-14,Dr Gallo>是吧
<5-14,Dr Gallo>Right?

188
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,830
<5-15,Leonard>直到今天  我还每年给她寄卡片
<5-15,Leonard>To this day, I send her a card every year

189
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,670
<5-15,Leonard>里面还附上一点钱
<5-15,Leonard>with a little money in it.

190
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,040
<6-1,Howard>一旦这房子只剩咱俩
<6-1,Howard>You know, once we get the house back to ourselves,

191
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,330
<6-1,Howard>我们就能在任何一个房间"搞浪漫"啦
<6-1,Howard>we can be romantic in any room we want.

192
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,800
<6-2,Bernadette>好棒  我终于可以让你知道洗衣房在哪了
<6-2,Bernadette>Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.

193
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,310
<6-3,Stuart>天啊  谁能想到
<6-3,Stuart>Boy, who would've thought

194
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,430
<6-3,Stuart>当时你让我搬进来照顾你妈
<6-3,Stuart>when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom,

195
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,730
<6-3,Stuart>结果两年后的今天我才走
<6-3,Stuart>I'd still be here two years later?

196
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,620
<6-5,Bernadette>-没人有想到  -没人
<6-5,Bernadette>- Nobody thought that. - No one.

197
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,820
<6-6,Stuart>都结束了
<6-6,Stuart>Well, that's it.

198
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,730
<6-7,Bernadette>是啊
<6-7,Bernadette>I guess so.

199
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,300
<6-8,Stuart>感觉好奇怪
<6-8,Stuart>This is weird.

200
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,800
<6-9,Howard>是啊  一个成年人即将搬进他自己的公寓
<6-9,Howard>Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment.

201
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,970
<6-9,Howard>真是疯狂的年代  回见
<6-9,Howard>Crazy times. See ya!

202
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,100
<6-10,Bernadette>别管他
<6-10,Bernadette>Ignore him.

203
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,280
<6-10,Bernadette>他只是用幽默来表达他现在...
<6-10,Bernadette>He's just using humor to express how...

204
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,920
<6-10,Bernadette>有多开心
<6-10,Bernadette>happy he is.

205
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,390
<6-11,Stuart>没关系  我知道他爱我
<6-11,Stuart>It's okay. I know he loves me.

206
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,930
<6-12,Bernadette>你说是就是啦
<6-12,Bernadette>Sure he does.

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,890
<6-12,Bernadette>你安顿好了记得告诉我们
<6-12,Bernadette>Well, let us know when you're all settled in.

208
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,780
<6-12,Bernadette>我会的
<6-12,Bernadette>I will.

209
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,670
<6-13,Stuart>我对你们真的感激不尽
<6-13,Stuart>And I really can't thank you guys enough.

210
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,190
<6-14,Bernadette>我们的荣幸
<6-14,Bernadette>Our pleasure.

211
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,030
<6-15,Stuart>-再见  -再见
<6-15,Stuart>- Bye. - Bye.

212
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,620
<6-17,Howard>他走了
<6-17,Howard>He's gone!

213
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,540
<6-17,Howard>我们从车库开始搞吧
<6-17,Howard>Let's start in the garage!

214
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,950
<7-1,Raj>好了  一旦我们接收到下一张图像
<7-1,Raj>Ok, so once we received the next image

215
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,140
<7-1,Raj>把它跟我们之前搜集的作对比
<7-1,Raj>and compare it to the ones we've already collected,

216
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,970
<7-1,Raj>就能知道我们发现的是什么了
<7-1,Raj>we'll know what it is that we found.

217
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,310
<7-2,Sheldon>或许是日鞘闪烁的光
<7-2,Sheldon>Ooh, perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation.

218
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,430
<7-3,Raj>也可能是外海王星天体
<7-3,Raj>It could be a trans-Neptunian object.

219
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,370
<7-4,Sheldon>也许是一个新星球
<7-4,Sheldon>Maybe it's a new planet.

220
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,820
<7-5,Raj>不太可能  但可能是矮行星
<7-5,Raj>Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.

221
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,510
<7-6,Sheldon>只要它有健康的重力
<7-6,Sheldon>Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity

222
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,670
<7-6,Sheldon>该有的卫星都有  我就开心了
<7-6,Sheldon>and all its moons, I'll be happy.

223
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,560
<7-7,Raj>好了  最后一张图片来了
<7-7,Raj>Okay, the final image is coming in.

224
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,920
<7-7,Raj>我们发现的天体是...
<7-7,Raj>And the object we discovered is...

225
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,520
<7-7,Raj>拜托了
<7-7,Raj>Come on,

226
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,910
<7-8,Sheldon>爸比需要一颗可以施行铁拳政策的宜居星球
<7-8,Sheldon>Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.

227
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
<7-9,Raj>一颗中型小行星
<7-9,Raj>A medium-sized asteroid.

228
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,610
<7-9,Raj>就这样吗
<7-9,Raj>That's it?

229
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,030
<7-10,Sheldon>真普通
<7-10,Sheldon>How common.

230
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,550
<7-10,Sheldon>简直就是太空菜单上的鸡柳啊
<7-10,Sheldon>That's the chicken fingers on the menu of space.

231
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,340
<7-11,Raj>我挺喜欢鸡柳的
<7-11,Raj>I kind of like chicken fingers.

232
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,640
<7-12,Sheldon>我也是  我只是想不到其他比喻了
<7-12,Sheldon>Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.

233
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,420
<7-13,Raj>别这样嘛  一颗中型小行星
<7-13,Raj>Come on, a medium-sized asteroid

234
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,370
<7-13,Raj>也是一项有意思的发现啊
<7-13,Raj>is still an interesting discovery.

235
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,860
<7-14,Sheldon>我想它的确有可能会跟地球撞上
<7-14,Sheldon>I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth

236
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,580
<7-14,Sheldon>毁掉一切生命体
<7-14,Sheldon>and destroy life as we know it.

237
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,580
<7-15,Raj>你我梦想天差地远
<7-15,Raj>You dream different than me.

238
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,090
<7-16,Sheldon>它还挺可爱的
<7-16,Sheldon>It is kind of cute.

239
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,270
<7-17,Raj>的确  我们还能给它起名字哦
<7-17,Raj>Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.

240
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,270
<7-18,Sheldon>我们最好选一个没人会取笑的名字
<7-18,Sheldon>We better choose a name no one can make fun of.

242
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,610
<7-18,Sheldon>赫歇尔爵士取的名字就坑死天王星了
<7-18,Sheldon>Sir Frederick William Herschel didn't do Uranus any favors.

243
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,160
<8-2,Penny>-进展如何  -很顺利
<8-2,Penny>- Hey, how'd it go? - Oh, great.

244
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,500
<8-3,Leonard>加洛医生太棒了
<8-3,Leonard>Dr. Gallo is terrific.

245
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,620
<8-3,Leonard>我一直觉得没有安全感
<8-3,Leonard>You know, I-I've always been insecure

246
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,290
<8-3,Leonard>因为没人关心我要说什么
<8-3,Leonard>that no one cares about what I have to say,

247
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,310
<8-3,Leonard>-但她让我觉得...  -没人关心这个啦
<8-3,Leonard>- but she made me see... - Yeah, no one cares.

248
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,920
<8-4,Penny>你到底有没有帮我说话
<8-4,Penny>Did you help me out or not?

249
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,870
<8-5,Leonard>好吧  我听你这句话
<8-5,Leonard>Okay, n-now, what I'm hearing

250
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,940
<8-5,Leonard>感觉像你嫌我有时用太多时间
<8-5,Leonard>is that you feel that I sometimes take too long

251
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,090
<8-5,Leonard>来表达自己的感受
<8-5,Leonard>to express myself,

252
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,980
<8-5,Leonard>你希望我说话简单明了
<8-5,Leonard>and you wish I'd be more succinct.

253
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,900
<8-6,Penny>我之所以说出来是因为
<8-6,Penny>You're only hearing that because

254
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,500
<8-6,Penny>你听不到我翻白眼的声音
<8-6,Penny>I cannot roll my eyes any louder.

255
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,660
<8-7,Leonard>好吧  在我们谈了我跟我妈的问题后
<8-7,Leonard>All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother--

256
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,540
<8-7,Leonard>也没太深入  就聊了她怎么毁了我的人生
<8-7,Leonard>nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life--

257
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,130
<8-7,Leonard>我告诉她你和你的药
<8-7,Leonard>I told her about you and your drug;

258
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,660
<8-7,Leonard>她说她很乐意见你
<8-7,Leonard>she said she'd be happy to meet you.

259
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,710
<8-7,Leonard>真的吗
<8-7,Leonard>Really?

260
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,220
<8-8,Penny>你是史上最棒的老公了
<8-8,Penny>Oh, you're the best husband ever!

261
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,140
<8-9,Leonard>那你下周会跟我去神秘博士大会吗
<8-9,Leonard>So you'll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?

262
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,210
<8-10,Penny>会吧
<8-10,Penny>I guess.

263
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,660
<8-11,Leonard>这次我听出你白眼翻到外太空了
<8-11,Leonard>Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.

264
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,510
<9-1,Bernadette>天啊  斯尔图特从来没打扫过房间吧
<9-1,Bernadette>Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?

265
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,400
<9-2,Howard>肯定是
<9-2,Howard>No kidding.

266
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,220
<9-2,Howard>好了  某物要被我吸进吸尘器了
<9-2,Howard>Oh, okay, I'm about to suck something up.

267
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,170
<9-2,Howard>你觉得这东西听起来像什么
<9-2,Howard>What do you think this object sounds like?

268
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,750
<9-3,Bernadette>我不想再玩猜是乐高  脚趾甲  还是药丸的游戏
<9-3,Bernadette>Howie, I don't want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore.

269
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,660
<9-3,Bernadette>我们该怎么运用这个房间呢
<9-3,Bernadette>So, what do you think we should do with this room?

270
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,420
<9-4,Howard>我在考虑弄成家庭影院或游戏房
<9-4,Howard>Well, I was thinking a home theater or a gaming room--

271
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,150
<9-4,Howard>就像一个男人窝
<9-4,Howard>you know, like a man cave.

272
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,610
<9-5,Bernadette>为什么就不能是女人窝呢
<9-5,Bernadette>Why can't it be a woman cave?

273
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,930
<9-6,Howard>只要内含家庭影院  电子游戏机
<9-6,Howard>As long as it has a home theater, a video game system

274
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,990
<9-6,Howard>而且禁止你入内
<9-6,Howard>and you're not allowed in it,

275
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,780
<9-6,Howard>你想叫什么都行
<9-6,Howard>you can call it whatever you want.

276
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,580
<9-7,Bernadette>我是说真的啦
<9-7,Bernadette>I'm being serious.

277
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,540
<9-8,Howard>你觉得我们该怎么做
<9-8,Howard>Well, what do you think we should do?

278
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,310
<9-8,Howard>我不知道
<9-8,Howard>I don't know,

279
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,150
<9-9,Bernadette>或许弄成家庭办公室或...
<9-9,Bernadette>maybe a home office or...

280
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,890
<9-9,Bernadette>瞧
<9-9,Bernadette>Look.

281
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,390
<9-9,Bernadette>我们带斯尔图特去园游会时  他赢的泰迪熊
<9-9,Bernadette>The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.

282
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,130
<9-10,Howard>他当时超级兴奋
<9-10,Howard>He was so excited.

283
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,620
<9-10,Howard>是啊
<9-10,Howard>Yeah.

284
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,080
<9-11,Bernadette>不管他们怎么绞尽脑汁
<9-11,Bernadette>You know, no matter how hard they tried,

285
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,040
<9-11,Bernadette>都猜不出来他几岁
<9-11,Bernadette>they could not guess his age.

286
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,180
<9-12,Howard>下次我看见他时给他吧
<9-12,Howard>I'll give it to him next time I see him.

287
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,650
<9-13,Bernadette>-他走了之后有和你联系吗  -没有
<9-13,Bernadette>- Have you heard from him since he left? - No.

288
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,920
<9-14,Howard>以为他安顿好了  就会给我们打电话呢
<9-14,Howard>You'd think he would've called once he got settled in.

289
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,220
<9-15,Bernadette>也许他比较忙吧
<9-15,Bernadette>Hmm. Maybe he's busy.

290
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,200
<9-16,Howard>忙到电话都打不了吗
<9-16,Howard>Too busy to call?

291
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,180
<9-16,Howard>他用我的会员账号
<9-16,Howard>He wasn't too busy

292
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,430
<9-16,Howard>上网追《燃情克利夫兰》就有空吗
<9-16,Howard>to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password.

293
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
<9-16,Howard>怎么回事
<9-16,Howard>What is happening?

294
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,960
<9-16,Howard>我们是在想他吗
<9-16,Howard>Are we missing him?

295
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,030
<9-17,Bernadette>没有  这种感觉才不是想他
<9-17,Bernadette>No, that's not what this feeling is.

296
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,650
<9-17,Bernadette>是吗
<9-17,Bernadette>Is it?

297
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,960
<9-18,Howard>当然不是  他总能逼疯我们
<9-18,Howard>Of course not. He drove us crazy.

298
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,000
<9-18,Howard>还记得有一次你准备烤个派
<9-18,Howard>Like when you were gonna make that pie

299
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,710
<9-18,Howard>结果斯图尔特把蓝莓都吃光了
<9-18,Howard>and Stuart ate all the blueberries.

300
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,470
<9-19,Bernadette>他还想赖账  可是牙都吃紫了
<9-19,Bernadette>And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.

301
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,660
<9-20,Howard>还挺可爱的
<9-20,Howard>That was pretty cute.

302
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,230
<9-21,Bernadette>是啊
<9-21,Bernadette>Yeah.

303
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,870
<9-21,Bernadette>靠  我们真是在想他
<9-21,Bernadette>Ew, we are missing him!

304
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,420
<10-1,Raj>我在想  或许我们可以
<10-1,Raj>So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name

305
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,960
<10-1,Raj>把我俩名字拼起来给小行星命名
<10-1,Raj>for the asteroid by combining our names.

306
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,670
<10-1,Raj>这个主意好
<10-1,Raj>That's a great idea.

307
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,860
<10-2,Sheldon>我想到了
<10-2,Sheldon>I've got it.

308
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,510
<10-2,Sheldon>我们就叫它...库珀
<10-2,Sheldon>We'll call it... Cooper.

309
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,750
<10-3,Raj>这哪里是我们俩的名字
<10-3,Raj>How is that both our names?

310
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,270
<10-4,Sheldon>库是取自"库"萨帕里  而珀取自库"珀"
<10-4,Sheldon>"Koo" from Koothrappali and "per" from Cooper.

311
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,300
<10-5,Raj>好吧  所以是我的那个"库"吗
<10-5,Raj>Yeah, s-so it's, like, Kooper with a "K"?

312
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,230
<10-6,Sheldon>不要了  你说得对  这主意太蠢了
<10-6,Sheldon>Nah, you're right, that's dumb.

313
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,450
<10-8,Sheldon>莱纳德  好消息
<10-8,Sheldon>Oh, Leonard, great news.

314
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,010
<10-8,Sheldon>我们一起发现了一颗中型小行星
<10-8,Sheldon>We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.

315
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,700
<10-9,Leonard>太棒了
<10-9,Leonard>Wow, that's amazing!

316
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,720
<10-9,Leonard>我今天心情也很不错
<10-9,Leonard>I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.

317
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,620
<10-10,Sheldon>行吧  看来你要把话题转到你身上了
<10-10,Sheldon>Okay. Guess we're gonna talk about you now.

318
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,790
<10-11,Leonard>是的  因为加洛医生让我意识到
<10-11,Leonard>Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize

319
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,700
<10-11,Leonard>我是值得好好对待的人  我的感觉也很重要
<10-11,Leonard>that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.

320
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,530
<10-12,Raj>我是免费从一张猫咪海报上学到
<10-12,Raj>I learned that for free from a cat poster,

321
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,300
<10-12,Raj>不过你开心就好
<10-12,Raj>but good for you.

322
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,850
<10-13,Sheldon>好的  说回我这里
<10-13,Sheldon>Okay, back to me.

323
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,300
<10-13,Sheldon>我发现了一颗小行星
<10-13,Sheldon>I discovered an asteroid,

324
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,620
<10-13,Sheldon>现在我可以给它起名了
<10-13,Sheldon>and now I get to name it.

325
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,380
<10-14,Raj>等等  不是我们吗
<10-14,Raj>Wait, what happened to us?

326
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,520
<10-15,Sheldon>现在重点不是我们
<10-15,Sheldon>Now, this isn't about us,

327
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,750
<10-15,Sheldon>而是怎样才算对小行星好
<10-15,Sheldon>this is about what's best for the asteroid.

328
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,160
<10-16,Leonard>你们准备给它起名叫什么
<10-16,Leonard>What are you thinking of naming it?

329
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,870
<10-17,Sheldon>我还没有定下来
<10-17,Sheldon>I haven't settled on anything yet.

330
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,710
<10-18,Raj>我们还没有定下来
<10-18,Raj>We haven't settled on anything yet.

331
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,390
<10-19,Sheldon>棒棒棒  猫咪海报  一边挂着去
<10-19,Sheldon>All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.

332
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,470
<10-20,Leonard>用你们女朋友的名字命名不是更好吗
<10-20,Leonard>You know what'd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends.

333
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,950
<10-20,Leonard>显得你们多在乎她们啊
<10-20,Leonard>Show them how much you care.

334
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,400
<10-21,Raj>这个主意妙啊
<10-21,Raj>That is a great idea.

335
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,180
<10-22,Sheldon>完美
<10-22,Sheldon>It's perfect.

336
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,620
<10-22,Sheldon>表面好像很浪漫
<10-22,Sheldon>It appears romantic,

337
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,420
<10-22,Sheldon>其实只是太空里的一块石头而已
<10-22,Sheldon>but it's really just a rock in space

338
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,450
<10-22,Sheldon>还能让我以后都不用愁情人节了
<10-22,Sheldon>that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever.

339
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,220
<10-23,Raj>你有什么想法  把她们名字拼起来吗
<10-23,Raj>So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?

340
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,180
<10-24,Sheldon>这样可以
<10-24,Sheldon>I like it.

341
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,880
<10-24,Sheldon>我们就从艾米的名字里取"艾"字
<10-24,Sheldon>Yeah, we'll take the "A-M" from Amy and, uh,

342
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,570
<10-24,Sheldon>然后艾米丽的名字里取"米"字
<10-24,Sheldon>the "Y" from Emily.

343
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,880
<10-25,Raj>那就是"艾米"啊
<10-25,Raj>That's just Amy.

344
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,380
<10-26,Sheldon>正是如此  瞧我们合作无间啊
<10-26,Sheldon>Exactly. See how well we work together?

345
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,940
<10-27,Penny>在双盲试验中
<10-27,Penny>And in double-blind studies,

346
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,390
<10-27,Penny>此药被证明对治疗各种焦虑症
<10-27,Penny>Placinex proved extremely effective in treating

347
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,880
<10-27,Penny>都极其有效
<10-27,Penny>all kinds of anxiety.

348
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,160
<10-27,Penny>说个有意思的事  实验室里的人
<10-27,Penny>Actually, funny story-- the boys in the lab

349
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,820
<10-27,Penny>很焦虑食品药物管理局会不批这个药
<10-27,Penny>were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex;

350
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,330
<10-27,Penny>就开始吃这药  然后就再也不担心了
<10-27,Penny>they started taking it, stopped worrying.

351
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,740
<10-28,Dr Gallo>懂了
<10-28,Dr Gallo>Got it.

352
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,390
<10-29,Penny>你有什么问题想问吗
<10-29,Penny>Uh, do you have any questions?

353
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,060
<10-30,Dr Gallo>就一个
<10-30,Dr Gallo>Just one.

354
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,610
<10-32,Dr Gallo>当你让你老公扮成病人
<10-32,Dr Gallo>When you made your husband pretend to be a patient

355
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,780
<10-32,Dr Gallo>好让你有机会跟我接触时
<10-32,Dr Gallo>so you could get access to me,

356
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,530
<10-32,Dr Gallo>你当时在想什么呢
<10-32,Dr Gallo>what were you thinking there?

357
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,870
<10-33,Penny>我是指关于药的问题
<10-33,Penny>I just... meant a question about the drug.

358
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,170
<10-34,Dr Gallo>我知道你是什么意思
<10-34,Dr Gallo>Yeah, I know what you meant.

359
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,360
<10-34,Dr Gallo>先把这个放在一边
<10-34,Dr Gallo>Let's put that aside for a minute

360

<11-4,Sheldon>看来我得解释一下
<11-4,Sheldon>Perhaps I should explain.

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,480
<11-5,Amy>谢尔顿  谢谢你

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,140
<11-5,Amy>他同意让你用这名字吗
<11-5,Amy>He was okay with you choosing the name?

381
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,900
<11-6,Sheldon>确实花了一些时间磋商
<11-6,Sheldon>Well, it took a little negotiating,

382
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,050
<11-6,Sheldon>最后我将他说服了
<11-6,Sheldon>but I wore him down.

383
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,480

<12-1,Penny>when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys?

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,490
<12-1,Penny>你跟人上床的时候
<12-1,Penny>I mean, have you ever had sex

<12-3,Penny>有"搞"头那种
<12-3,Penny>Doable.

<12-6,Dr Gallo>莱纳德确实说过他很多事
<12-6,Dr Gallo>Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him.
