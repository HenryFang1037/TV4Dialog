1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:05,200
<1-1,Sheldon>史上最逊的文艺复兴集会
<1-1,Sheldon>Worst. renaissance. fair. ever.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,930
<1-2,Leonard>别再墨迹了  谢尔顿
<1-2,Leonard>Please let it go, sheldon.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,100
<1-3,Sheldon>还原历史的准确度也太低了
<1-3,Sheldon>It was rife with historical inaccuracies.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,030
<1-3,Sheldon>举个例子  客栈的女服务生上给我们一大壶蜂蜜酒
<1-3,Sheldon>For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,300
<1-3,Sheldon>她的服装明显是日耳曼式的
<1-3,Sheldon>Her costume was obviously germanic.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,330
<1-3,Sheldon>但在1487年  巴伐利亚纯酿法令
<1-3,Sheldon>But in 1487, the bavarian purity laws,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,930
<1-3,Sheldon>或者叫"纯度法令"
<1-3,Sheldon>Or "reinheitsgebot,"

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,360
<1-3,Sheldon>严格限制了蜂蜜酒的可用性
<1-3,Sheldon>Severely limited the availability of mead.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,460
<1-3,Sheldon>最多他们只能用一点调味酒
<1-3,Sheldon>At best, they would have had some sort of spiced wine.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,960
<1-4,Leonard>你真是太吹毛求疵了
<1-4,Leonard>You're nitpicking.

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,460
<1-4,Leonard>是吗
<1-4,Leonard>Oh, really?

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,460
<1-5,Sheldon>那我就再来挑一下疵  那个酒壶
<1-5,Sheldon>Well here is another nit for you.The flagons

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,800
<1-5,Sheldon>在以前绝对不会是用聚丙烯做的
<1-5,Sheldon>Would not have been made of polypropylene.

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,600
<1-6,Howard>文艺复兴集会的重点不是历史准确度有多高
<1-6,Howard>Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy.

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,360
<1-6,Howard>重点在于把那些在金考公司上班的丰满女孩们带来
<1-6,Howard>They're about taking chubby girls who work at kinko's

16
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,300
<1-6,Howard>给她们系上紧身胸衣
<1-6,Howard>And lacing them up in corsets so tight

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,000
<1-6,Howard>好让她们的波波跳出来和我们说  您好
<1-6,Howard>Their bosom jumps out and says, "howdy."

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,730
<1-7,Sheldon>十五世纪的胸部不会说  您好
<1-7,Sheldon>Bosoms would not have said "howdy" in the 15th century.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,230
<1-7,Sheldon>如果要说的话  也只能是  万岁
<1-7,Sheldon>If anything, they would've said, "huzzah."

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,560
<1-8,Howard>我才不管波波说什么  谢尔顿
<1-8,Howard>I don't care what the bosoms say, sheldon.

21
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,300
<1-8,Howard>只要它们在对我说话就好
<1-8,Howard>I just want to be part of the conversation.

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,200
<1-9,Penny (arriving with a man in tow)>伙计们
<1-9,Penny (arriving with a man in tow)>Hi, guys.

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,460
<1-9,Penny (arriving with a man in tow)>好像你们刚才去文艺复兴集会了
<1-9,Penny (arriving with a man in tow)>Looks like you've been to the renaissance fair...

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,630
<1-9,Penny (arriving with a man in tow)>我希望是
<1-9,Penny (arriving with a man in tow)>I'm hoping.

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,160
<1-9,Penny (arriving with a man in tow)>文艺复兴集会吗
<1-9,Penny (arriving with a man in tow)>Renaissance fair?

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,400
<1-10,Sheldon>更像是中世纪兼启蒙时代
<1-10,Sheldon>More of a medieval, slash, age of enlightenment,

27
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,660
<1-10,Sheldon>兼找借口穿遮阴布的集会
<1-10,Sheldon>Slash, any-excuse- to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

28
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,030
<1-11,Penny>好吧  随便你
<1-11,Penny>Okay, fine, whatever.

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,400
<1-11,Penny>伙计们  这是我的朋友  埃里克
<1-11,Penny>You guys, this is my friend eric.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,530
<1-15,Leonard>很高兴见到你
<1-15,Leonard>So, yeah, good to see you.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,260
<1-16,Penny>我也是
<1-16,Penny>It's good to see you, too.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,100
<1-16,Penny>我们应该走了
<1-16,Penny>We should probably go.

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,930
<1-18,Penny(leaving)>大家再见
<1-18,Penny(leaving)>Bye, guys.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,300
<1-19,Eric (leaving, to Howard)>我很喜欢你的帽子
<1-19,Eric (leaving, to Howard)>I like your hat.

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,860
<1-20,Howard>谢谢  是我妈做的
<1-20,Howard>Thanks, my mom made it.

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,600
<1-20,Howard>佩妮有了新男友  非常尴尬
<1-20,Howard>Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.

37
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,460
<1-20,Howard>没什么尴尬的
<1-20,Howard>It wasn't awkward.

38
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,560
<1-20,Howard>不过也不算好玩
<1-20,Howard>It wasn't fun.

39
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,160
<1-21,Leonard>再说了  有什么关系
<1-21,Leonard>Besides, what's the big deal?

40
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,060
<1-21,Leonard>我们约会过  然后不约会了  事情已经过去了
<1-21,Leonard>We dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,260
<1-22,Raj>你说过去了的意思
<1-22,Raj>By moving on,

42
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,100
<1-22,Raj>是不是指当她和另外一个男人约会的时候
<1-22,Raj>Do you mean she's going out with other men

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,230
<1-22,Raj>你却整个下午都在
<1-22,Raj>And you spent the afternoon

44
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,760
<1-22,Raj>和沃罗威茨做十五世纪的肥皂
<1-22,Raj>Making 15th-century soap with wolowitz?

45
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,630
<1-23,Sheldon>那不是十五世纪的肥皂
<1-23,Sheldon>That was not 15th century soap.

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,630
<1-23,Sheldon>我的天呐  那些人必须得学学
<1-23,Sheldon>My god, those people need to learn

47
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,830
<1-23,Sheldon>不是在一样东西名字前加上"老"字[仿古字]
<1-23,Sheldon>You can't just put "ye olde" in front of anything you want

48
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,930
<1-23,Sheldon>就能冒充古老的东西了
<1-23,Sheldon>And expect to get away with it.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,100
<1-24,Leonard>我们快点进去好吗
<1-24,Leonard>Can we please just go in?

50
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,260
<1-24,Leonard>我的锁子甲被夹在内裤里了
<1-24,Leonard>My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

51
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,130
<1-25,Sheldon>你穿了现代的内裤
<1-25,Sheldon>You're wearing modern underwear?

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,930
<1-26,Leonard>相对来说是现代的
<1-26,Leonard>Relatively modern.

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,300
<1-26,Leonard>干嘛  你穿了什么
<1-26,Leonard>Why, what are you wearing?

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,300
<1-27,Sheldon>我严格遵守历史  准确无误地
<1-27,Sheldon>I fashioned historically accurate undergarments

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,260
<1-27,Sheldon>穿着亚麻布内衣
<1-27,Sheldon>Out of linen.

56
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,760
<1-28,Leonard>你去买亚麻布了
<1-28,Leonard>You went out and bought linen?

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,930
<1-29,Sheldon>别傻了  我只是借用了你的枕头套
<1-29,Sheldon>Don't be silly-- I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

58
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,660
<1-30,Leonard>借用
<1-30,Leonard>Borrowed?

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,160
<2-1,Leonard>你们知道吗  我很高兴佩妮有了新发展
<2-1,Leonard>You know what,I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

60
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,200
<2-1,Leonard>这样我就可以自由前进了
<2-1,Leonard>It gives me the freedom to move on myself.

61
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,530
<2-2,Howard>你的意思是你一直以来都在踌躇
<2-2,Howard>Are you saying that you've been holding back?

62
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
<2-3,Leonard>当然
<2-3,Leonard>Of course.

63
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,060
<2-3,Leonard>出于对她的尊敬
<2-3,Leonard>Out of respect.

64
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,230
<2-4,Howard>那么在佩妮之前的十年你怎么解释
<2-4,Howard>So, how do you explain the ten years before penny?

65
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,900
<2-5,Raj>那时候你在尊敬谁
<2-5,Raj>Who were you respecting then?

66
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,130
<2-6,Leonard>我和很多女人约会过啊
<2-6,Leonard>Well, I've dated plenty of women.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
<2-6,Leonard>有乔伊斯·金
<2-6,Leonard>There was joyce kim...

68
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,730
<2-6,Leonard>莱斯利·温克尔
<2-6,Leonard>Leslie winkle...

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,630
<2-7,Sheldon>通知一下牛津词典的编者
<2-7,Sheldon>Notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary.

70
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,560
<2-7,Sheldon>"许多"这个词被重新定义为"二个"
<2-7,Sheldon>The word "plenty" has been redefined to mean "two."

71
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,600
<2-8,Leonard>去年那个在动漫展里的那个女孩呢
<2-8,Leonard>What about that girl last year at comic-con?

72
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,630
<2-9,Raj>不算
<2-9,Raj>Doesn't count.

73
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,830
<2-10,Leonard>为什么
<2-10,Leonard>Why not?

74
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,460
<2-11,Raj>在动漫展服装扮演里发生的事情
<2-11,Raj>What happens in costume at comic-con

75
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,560
<2-11,Raj>只是动漫展的事情
<2-11,Raj>Stays at comic-con.

76
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,660
<2-12,Howard>你这样说
<2-12,Howard>You're only saying that

77
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,160
<2-12,Howard>只是因为你的那件事
<2-12,Howard>Because of what happened to you.

78
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,230
<2-13,Leonard>什么事
<2-13,Leonard>What happened to you?

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,800
<2-14,Raj>没什么
<2-14,Raj>Nothing happened to me.

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,630
<2-15,Howard>这不是你的错  拉吉
<2-15,Howard>It wasn't your fault, raj.

81
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,860
<2-15,Howard>他只是打扮成了绿色的猎户座女奴
<2-15,Howard>He was dressed as a green orion slave girl.

82
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,700
<2-16,Raj>怎么开始说我了
<2-16,Raj>How did we get on me?!

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,030
<2-16,Raj>我们不是在嘲笑莱纳德吗
<2-16,Raj>We were mocking leonard for not moving on.

84
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,630
<2-16,Raj>老兄  你完全是在原地踏步啊
<2-16,Raj>Dude, you have totally not moved on.

85
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,000
<2-17,Leonard>不是这样的
<2-17,Leonard>Yes, I have.

86
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,800
<2-17,Leonard>现在我只需要
<2-17,Leonard>It's just a matter of actually making

87
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,760
<2-17,Leonard>-和别人出去约会而已  -谁
<2-17,Leonard>A date with someone. like who?

88
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,560
<2-18,Howard>乔伊斯·金
<2-18,Howard>Well... there's joyce kim.

89
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,130
<2-19,Leonard>但她已经叛逃回朝鲜了
<2-19,Leonard>But she defected back to north korea,

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,360
<2-19,Leonard>所以在地理上来说有点小困难
<2-19,Leonard>So that's a little geographically undesirable.

91
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,700
<2-20,Raj>那莱斯利·温克尔呢
<2-20,Raj>What about leslie winkle?

92
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,960
<2-21,Sheldon>-不行  -为什么
<2-21,Sheldon>Oh, no. why?

93
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,900
<2-22,Raj>她的研究方法论漏洞百出
<2-22,Raj>Her research methodology is sloppy,

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,630
<2-23,Sheldon>她在说圈量子引力论的时候毫无道理的傲慢自大
<2-23,Sheldon>She's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity,

95
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,060
<2-23,Sheldon>而且更糟的是  她对我很坏
<2-23,Sheldon>And to make matters worse, she's often mean to me.

96
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,930
<2-24,Raj>我觉得她很火辣
<2-24,Raj>I think she's smoking hot.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,100
<2-25,Howard>同意
<2-25,Howard>I'd hit that.

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,360
<2-26,Sheldon>你觉得胶体悬浮系统上的
<2-26,Sheldon>You'd hit particulate soil

99
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,760
<2-26,Sheldon>微粒污垢也很火辣
<2-26,Sheldon>In a colloidal suspension.

100
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,360
<2-26,Sheldon>泥巴
<2-26,Sheldon>Mud.

101
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,160
<2-27,Leonard>我喜欢莱斯利  但她对约会并不感兴趣
<2-27,Leonard>Look, I like leslie, but she's not interested

102
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,960
<2-27,Leonard>她只想使用男人的工具来缓解自己的压力
<2-27,Leonard>In dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.

103
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,000
<2-28,Howard>那又如何  做她的工具好了
<2-28,Howard>Yeah, so? be a tool.

104
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,300
<2-28,Howard>你也可以给自己缓解一下"压力"
<2-28,Howard>Go get yourself a little rebound "stress release."

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,460
<2-29,Raj>严格来说  要是他和佩妮有过亲密接触的话
<2-29,Raj>Technically, it would only be rebound if he and penny

106
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,360
<2-29,Raj>那才能算是缓解压力
<2-29,Raj>Had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

107
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,700
<2-30,Howard>你是说像你和女奴理查德[男子名]那样吗
<2-30,Howard>You mean like you and richard the slave girl?

108
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,730
<2-31,Raj>我给他买了晚饭  然后亲了一下
<2-31,Raj>I bought him dinner and we kissed once!

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,900
<2-31,Raj>就结束了
<2-31,Raj>That was it.

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
<2-31,Raj>而且他告诉我他叫金伯利
<2-31,Raj>And he told me his name was kimberly.

111
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,930
<3-1,Sheldon>你知道我们如何知道我们不是在母体里的么[骇客帝国]
<3-1,Sheldon>You know how I know we're not in the matrix?

112
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,360
<3-2,Leonard>如何
<3-2,Leonard>How?

113
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,130
<3-3,Sheldon>如果我们是的话  这些食物就不会这么糟了
<3-3,Sheldon>If we were, the food would be better.

114
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,160
<3-4,Leslie (arriving)>嗨  莱纳德
<3-4,Leslie (arriving)>Hey, Leonard.

115
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,260
<3-5,Leonard>嗨  莱斯利
<3-5,Leonard>Hey, Leslie.

116
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,260
<3-6,Leslie>嗨  傻蛋
<3-6,Leslie>Hey, dummy.

117
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,760
<3-7,Sheldon>你好
<3-7,Sheldon>Hello, to you...

118
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,700
<3-7,Sheldon>你这个智商不够的人
<3-7,Sheldon>Insufficiently intelligent person.

119
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,960
<3-8,Leslie>快把我送到烧伤病房[阿甘正传里台词]
<3-8,Leslie>Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.

120
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,830
<3-8,Leslie>莱纳德  你有空么
<3-8,Leslie>Hey, Leonard, do you have a second?

121
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,260
<3-8,Leslie>-我想问你几个问题 -当然
<3-8,Leslie>-I need to ask you something. -sure.

122
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,460
<3-9,Leonard>如果你不介意的话
<3-9,Leonard>Well, if you'll excuse me,

123
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,730
<3-10,Sheldon>我要去做一些成绩斐然的工作
<3-10,Sheldon>I'm going to go do work that promises

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,760
<3-10,Sheldon>而不像你做的
<3-10,Sheldon>Significant results, as opposed to what you do...

125
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,830
<3-10,Sheldon>那些没有意义的
<3-10,Sheldon>Which does not.

126
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,730
<3-10,Sheldon>没错  就是说你呢
<3-10,Sheldon>Yeah, you heard me.

127
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,530
<3-11,Leslie>我听说你和佩妮吹了
<3-11,Leslie>So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground

128
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,400
<3-11,Leslie>就像从飞机厕所里扔出的蓝冰一样吹了
<3-11,Leslie>Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.

129
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,860
<3-12,Leonard>这你是听谁说的
<3-12,Leonard>Where did you hear that?

130
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,800
<3-13,Leslie>其实是我读到的  沃罗威茨发短信给我
<3-13,Leslie>Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me.

131
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,030
<3-14,Leonard>"就像从飞机厕所里扔出的蓝冰一样"  好吧
<3-14,Leonard>"like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory," yeah.

132
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,160
<3-15,Leslie>我觉得这个笑话很不错  我发给他一个LOL[笑脸]
<3-15,Leslie>I thought it was a pretty good one. I gave him an lol.

133
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,600
<3-15,Leslie>不过  这让我想到
<3-15,Leslie>Anyway, it got me thinking.

134
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,000
<3-15,Leslie>你现在是单身一人
<3-15,Leslie>Now that you're unattached,

135
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,560
<3-15,Leslie>说不定我们能重温一下之前的关系
<3-15,Leslie>Maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.

136
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,160
<3-16,Leonard>你是在暗示再来一次"舒缓压力"么
<3-16,Leonard>Are you suggesting another bout of stress release?

137
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,760
<3-17,Leslie>不  我受够临时性爱了
<3-17,Leslie>No, I'm all done with casual sex.

138
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,060
<3-17,Leslie>从现在开始
<3-17,Leslie>From now on, I'm fully committed

139
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,900
<3-17,Leslie>我只要传统的关系模式
<3-17,Leslie>To the traditional relationship paradigm.

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,100
<3-18,Leonard>真的  这之间有什么不同
<3-18,Leonard>Really? what changed?

141
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,630
<3-19,Leslie>很难说
<3-19,Leslie>It's hard to say.

142
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,200
<3-19,Leslie>我想大概在每个女人一生总有那么一段时间
<3-19,Leslie>I guess there's just a time in every woman's life

143
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,160
<3-19,Leslie>厌倦了醒来发现自己躺在陌生的沙发上
<3-19,Leslie>When she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon

144
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,060
<3-19,Leslie>和一群她根本不认识的人在一起
<3-19,Leslie>With a bunch of people she doesn't know.

145
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,400
<3-20,Leonard>我明白  一群人
<3-20,Leonard>Yeah, I can see how that would-- a bunch of people?

146
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,260
<3-21,Leslie>无论如何  我想该是慢慢来的时候了
<3-21,Leslie>Anyway, I figure it's time to slow things down

147
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,660
<3-21,Leslie>又有谁比你更适合慢慢来呢
<3-21,Leslie>And who better to slow things down with than you?

148
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,630
<3-22,Leonard>噢  我深感荣幸
<3-22,Leonard>Oh... I'm flattered.

149
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,260
<3-22,Leonard>那你认为我们应该怎么开始
<3-22,Leonard>So how do you suggest we proceed?

150
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,860
<3-23,Leslie>去你家  点份中国菜  租一部电影
<3-23,Leslie>Your place, we'll order chinese, you'll rent a movie--

151
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,130
<3-23,Leslie>文艺一点但不要那么深奥  然后轻轻的抚摸  不发生性关系
<3-23,Leslie>Artsy, but accessible-- then light petting, no coitus.

152
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,700
<3-24,Leonard>听起来不错
<3-24,Leonard>Sounds fun.

153
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,200
<3-25,Leslie>你可以来决定那些细节部分
<3-25,Leslie>I'll leave the details up to you.

154
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,000
<3-25,Leslie>我想如果你设想你是男性角色的话会比较好
<3-25,Leslie>I think it's better if you assume the male role.

155
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,630
<3-26,Leonard>谢谢  想的真周到
<3-26,Leonard>Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

156
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,760
<3-27,Leslie>好
<3-27,Leslie>Great.

<4-3,Sheldon>马里奥差不多就能通关了  怀念旧日校园生活啊
<4-3,Sheldon>It's time to rock mario, old school.

163
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,300
<4-4,Leonard>今天晚上貌似我有别的计划了
<4-4,Leonard>I kind of have other plans tonight.

<4-5,Sheldon>Friday's always vintage game night.

166
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,430
<4-5,Sheldon>你看我妈把记忆卡也寄来了
<4-5,Sheldon>Look, mom included the memory card.

167
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,560
<4-5,Sheldon>我们可以从我1999年的纪录接着打
<4-5,Sheldon>We can pick up right where I left off in 1999

168
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,800
<4-5,Sheldon>那时候我得了恶性贫血症
<4-5,Sheldon>When I had pernicious anemia.

169
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,960
<4-6,Leonard>问题是有人要来
<4-6,Leonard>Well, the thing is, someone's coming over.

170
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,560
<4-7,Sheldon>没关系  我有三副手柄
<4-7,Sheldon>Okay, no problem. I have three controllers.

171

173
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,230
<4-8,Leonard>我有个约会
<4-8,Leonard>I have a date coming over.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,360
<4-9,Sheldon>不要怪我猜不到是这么回事
<4-9,Sheldon>Well, you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.

175
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,830
<4-10,Leonard>为什么  我有约会这事很新奇么
<4-10,Leonard>Why? what's so unusual about me having a date?

176
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
<4-11,Sheldon>统计学意义上  是的
<4-11,Sheldon>Well, statistically speaking...

177
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,730
<4-11,Sheldon>好吧
<4-11,Sheldon>All right, all right.

178

<4-12,Leonard>如果你能呈缺省态
<4-12,Leonard>And I'd appreciate it if you would, you know,

180
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,500
<4-12,Leonard>我会感激不尽的
<4-12,Leonard>Make yourself scarce.

181
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,130
<4-13,Sheldon>莱纳德  我是理论物理学家
<4-13,Sheldon>Leonard, I'm a published theoretical physicist

<4-13,Sheldon>我有两个博士学位
<4-13,Sheldon>With two doctorates and an iq

183
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
<4-13,Sheldon>还有普通测试无法准确测量的智商水平
<4-13,Sheldon>Which can't be accurely measured by normal tests.

184
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,460
<4-13,Sheldon>我还能更稀缺点么
<4-13,Sheldon>How much scarcer could I be?

185
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,030
<4-14,Leonard>你知道我的意思的
<4-14,Leonard>You know what I mean.

186
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,500
<4-14,Leonard>你能不能给我们一点私人空间
<4-14,Leonard>Could you just give us a little privacy?

<4-15,Sheldon>-你想让我离开这个公寓  -是的
<4-15,Sheldon>-You want me to leave the apartment? -yes.

<4-19,Sheldon>Well, why should I leave? this is my apartment, too.

192
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,430
<4-20,Leonard>我知道  如果科学家能够发现你们种族里
<4-20,Leonard>I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member

193
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
<4-20,Leonard>你的另一个同类  如果你们两个想要一点隐私
<4-20,Leonard>Of your species and you two would like some privacy,

194
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,260
<4-20,Leonard>我绝对乐意不碍你的事
<4-20,Leonard>I'd be more than happy to get out of your way.

195
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,060
<4-21,Sheldon>那好吧

<5-1,Penny>谢尔顿  你在这干嘛呢
<5-1,Penny>Sheldon, what are you doing?

197

<5-20,Sheldon>这么多被高估的物理学家
<5-20,Sheldon>In all the labs in all the world,

224
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,300
<5-20,Sheldon>为什么偏偏就选中了莱斯利·温克尔
<5-20,Sheldon>Why does it have to be leslie winkle?

225
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,430

<5-22,Sheldon>唯一的贡献
<5-22,Sheldon>If they resumed sending chimps into space.

<8-16,Sheldon>It's leslie winkle, penny.

351
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,330
<8-16,Sheldon>她看不起我的研究
<8-16,Sheldon>She belittles my research.

352
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,700
<8-17,Penny>亲爱的  太遗憾了
<8-17,Penny>Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

353
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,070
<8-18,Sheldon>她叫我"傻蛋"
<8-18,Sheldon>She called me "dumbass."

354
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,300
<8-19,Penny>我知道  听见了
<8-19,Penny>I know. I heard.

355
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,830
<8-20,Sheldon>现在看来  无奈之下
<8-20,Sheldon>Given this situation, I have no choice

356
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,670
<8-20,Sheldon>我只能收回我之前对
<8-20,Sheldon>But to withdraw my previous objections

357
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,130
<8-20,Sheldon>你和莱纳德关系的反对
<8-20,Sheldon>To your ill-considered relationship with leonard.

358
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,470
<8-21,Penny>那还真要谢谢你了
<8-21,Penny>Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.

359
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,800
<8-21,Penny>不过我想目前
<8-21,Penny>But I think for now,

360
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,700
<8-21,Penny>莱纳德和我只能做朋友了
<8-21,Penny>Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.

361
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,670
<8-22,Sheldon>不行  我不接受你这样的回答
<8-22,Sheldon>No, that response is unacceptable to me.

362
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,170
<8-23,Penny>谢尔顿  你是个聪明人
<8-23,Penny>Sheldon, you are a smart guy.

363
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,440
<8-23,Penny>-你一定知道  -我"聪明"
<8-23,Penny>You must know... I'm "smart"?

364
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,990
<8-24,Sheldon>我要是被归类为"聪明"  我的智商测试就要少六十分了
<8-24,Sheldon>I'd have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as "smart."

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,300
<8-25,Penny>你还让我说下去吗
<8-25,Penny>Are you gonna let me talk?

366
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,900
<8-26,Sheldon>对不起
<8-26,Sheldon>I'm sorry.

367
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,730
<8-27,Penny>你一定知道如果莱纳德和莱斯利要在一起
<8-27,Penny>You must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together,

368
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,630
<8-27,Penny>你怎么做都阻止不了的
<8-27,Penny>Nothing you can do is gonna stop it.

369
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,230
<8-28,Sheldon>你又在低估我的智商了  小姐
<8-28,Sheldon>You continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam.

370
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
<8-29,Penny>好了  这么说好了
<8-29,Penny>Okay, let me put it this way.

371
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,900
<8-29,Penny>如果你拿莱纳德当朋友  你要支持他
<8-29,Penny>If you're really leonard's friend, you will support him

372
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,600
<8-29,Penny>不管他和谁在一起
<8-29,Penny>No matter who he wants to be with.

373
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,370
<8-30,Sheldon>等会
<8-30,Sheldon>Wait a minute.

374
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,870
<8-30,Sheldon>为什么老要我支持他
<8-30,Sheldon>Why am I doing all the giving here?

375
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,370
<8-30,Sheldon>如果莱纳德拿我当朋友
<8-30,Sheldon>If leonard's really my friend,

376
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,700
<8-30,Sheldon>为什么他不支持我
<8-30,Sheldon>Why doesn't he have to support me

377
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,630
<8-30,Sheldon>讨厌莱斯利·温克尔
<8-30,Sheldon>An my hatred of leslie winkle?

378
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,000
<8-31,Penny>因为爱大于恨
<8-31,Penny>Because love trumps hate.

379
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,070
<8-32,Sheldon>哦  你现在是和事佬了
<8-32,Sheldon>Oh, now you're just making stuff up.

380
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,670
<8-33,Penny>好了  晚安  谢尔顿
<8-33,Penny>Okay, good night, sheldon.

381
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,130
<8-34,Sheldon>马里奥  真希望能像控制你一样
<8-34,Sheldon>Oh, mario, if only I could control everyone

382
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,970
<8-34,Sheldon>控制所有人
<8-34,Sheldon>The way I control you.

383
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,530
<8-34,Sheldon>跳呀  你这小管道工  跳跳跳
<8-34,Sheldon>Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.

384
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,870
<9-1,Sheldon (entering)>当你们到自然暂停时
<9-1,Sheldon (entering)>When the two of you reach a natural stopping point,

385
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,170
<9-1,Sheldon (entering)>我想说点事
<9-1,Sheldon (entering)>I'd like to have a word.

386
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,170
<9-2,Leonard>你要说的是"尿尿"  去就好了
<9-2,Leonard>The word is "pee-pee." just do it.

387
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,630
<9-2,Leonard>莱纳德  你是我朋友
<9-2,Leonard>Leonard, you're my friend,

388
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,170
<9-3,Sheldon>朋友就应该支持朋友
<9-3,Sheldon>And friends support their friends...

389
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,500
<9-3,Sheldon>显然如此
<9-3,Sheldon>Apparently.

390
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,300
<9-3,Sheldon>所以我收回对你想和莱斯利发展 的反对
<9-3,Sheldon>So I'm withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with leslie.

391
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,130
<9-4,Leonard>谢谢
<9-4,Leonard>Thank you.

392
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,730
<9-5,Sheldon>我会很绅士地
<9-5,Sheldon>I will graciously

393
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,370
<9-5,Sheldon>忽略一个事实  她是个又傲慢
<9-5,Sheldon>Overlook the fact that she is an arrogant,

394
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,870
<9-5,Sheldon>水平又低的科学家  竟然认为圈量子引力论
<9-5,Sheldon>Subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity

395
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,300
<9-5,Sheldon>比弦理论更好地结合了
<9-5,Sheldon>Better unites quantum mechanics with generally relativity

396
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,670
<9-5,Sheldon>量子力学和广义相对论
<9-5,Sheldon>Than does string theory.

397
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,270
<9-5,Sheldon>你们好好玩
<9-5,Sheldon>You kids have fun.

398
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,430
<9-6,Leslie>等下
<9-6,Leslie>Hang on a second.

399
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,800
<9-6,Leslie>圈量子引力论比弦理论更明确地提供了
<9-6,Leslie>Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions

400
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,130
<9-6,Leslie>可验证的假设
<9-6,Leslie>Than string theory.

401
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,570
<9-7,Sheldon>我听着呢  嘲弄我吧
<9-7,Sheldon>I'm listening. amuse me.

402
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,800
<9-8,Leslie>好的  首先  在量子时空观里
<9-8,Leslie>Okay, well, for one thing, we expect quantized space-time

403
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,370
<9-8,Leslie>细小的不同呈现为
<9-8,Leslie>To manifest itself as minute differences

404
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,070
<9-8,Leslie>不同光谱的不同速度
<9-8,Leslie>In the speed of light for different colors.

405
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,670
<9-9,Sheldon>胡扯  事物显然是由无数细小闭弦组成的
<9-9,Sheldon>Balderdash. matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

406
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,670
<9-10,Leslie>你就让他这么和我说话
<9-10,Leslie>Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?

407
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,300
<9-11,Leonard>两种理论都有道理
<9-11,Leonard>Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.

408
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,630
<9-12,Leslie>不  不是的  只有圈量子引力论
<9-12,Leslie>No, there isn't. only loop quantum gravity

409
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,770
<9-12,Leslie>计算出了黑洞的熵
<9-12,Leslie>Calculates the entropy of black holes.

410
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,130
<9-13,Leonard>谢尔顿  别发出那种声音  很不尊重人
<9-13,Leonard>Sheldon, don't make that noise. it's disrespectful.

411
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,230
<9-13,Leonard>我倒希望能尊敬
<9-13,Leonard>I should hope so.

412
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,930
<9-14,Sheldon>这是嘲笑的鼻音
<9-14,Sheldon>It was a snort of derision.

413
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
<9-15,Leslie>你赞同我的意见  对吧
<9-15,Leslie>You agree with me, right?

414
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,800
<9-15,Leslie>圈量子引力论是物理学的未来
<9-15,Leslie>Loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.

415
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,170
<9-16,Leonard>抱歉  莱斯利  我更倾向于空间弦化  而不是圈化
<9-16,Leonard>Sorry, leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.

416
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,700
<9-17,Leslie>我很庆幸在我们更进一步之前
<9-17,Leslie>I'm glad I found out the truth about you

417
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,570
<9-17,Leslie>发现你的真正想法
<9-17,Leslie>Before this went any further.

418
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,570
<9-18,Leonard>真正想法  什么真正想法
<9-18,Leonard>Truth? what truth?

419
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,470
<9-18,Leonard>我们讨论的是未验证的假想
<9-18,Leonard>We're talking about untested hypotheses.

420
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,630
<9-18,Leonard>没什么大不了的
<9-18,Leonard>It's no big deal.

421
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,200
<9-19,Leslie>没什么  真的吗
<9-19,Leslie>It isn't? really?

422
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,700
<9-19,Leslie>告诉我  莱纳德  我们怎么告诉孩子们
<9-19,Leslie>Tell me, leonard, how will we raise the children?

423
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,600
<9-20,Leonard>我  我想等他们大了
<9-20,Leonard>I... I guess we wait until they're old enough

424
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,970
<9-20,Leonard>让他们自己选择自己相信的理论
<9-20,Leonard>And let them choose their own theory.

425
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,070
<9-21,Leslie>不能让他们自己选  莱纳德  他们是孩子
<9-21,Leslie>We can't let them choose, leonard. they're children!

426
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,700
<9-22,Leonard>等会  你去哪
<9-22,Leonard>Wait. where are you going?

427
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,430
<9-22,Leonard>很抱歉
<9-22,Leonard>I'm sorry.

428
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,270
<9-23,Leslie>我可以接受我们的孩子
<9-23,Leslie>I could have accepted our kids being

429
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,930
<9-23,Leslie>在基因上不能吃冰激凌
<9-23,Leslie>Genetically unable to eat ice cream

430
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,530
<9-23,Leslie>或者对走台也没有坏印象
<9-23,Leslie>Or ever get a good view of a parade.

431
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,170
<9-23,Leslie>但这个
<9-23,Leslie>But this?

432
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,230
<9-23,Leslie>这是原则问题
<9-23,Leslie>This is a deal breaker.

433
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:06,030
<9-24,Sheldon>-看好的一面吧  -好的一面是什么
<9-24,Sheldon>-Look on the bright side. -What's the bright side?

434
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,170
<9-26,Sheldon>还有九个月就到动漫盛会了
<9-26,Sheldon>Only nine more months to comic-con.

435
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,370
<9-27,Leonard>太好了
<9-27,Leonard>Oh, yeah.

436
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,270
<10-1,Sheldon>船长  我捕获到异常信号
<10-1,Sheldon>Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.

437
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,470
<10-2,Leonard>哦  还不错
<10-2,Leonard>Yeah, that's great.

438
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,700
<10-2,Leonard>你们想要玉米肠吗
<10-2,Leonard>You guys want a corn dog?

439
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,130
<10-3,Howard>好的
<10-3,Howard>Yeah.

440
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
<10-4,Sheldon>时代混乱
<10-4,Sheldon>That's a temporal anomaly.

441
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,130
<10-4,Sheldon>玉米肠直到
<10-4,Sheldon>Corn dog's didn't come into existence

442
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,430
<10-4,Sheldon>二十世纪上半叶才出现
<10-4,Sheldon>Till the first half of the 20th century.
