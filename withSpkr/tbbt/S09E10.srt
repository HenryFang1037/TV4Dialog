00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,410
<3-6,Sheldon>谢尔顿·库珀的发疯之路
<3-6,Sheldon>Sheldon Cooper's descent into madness...

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,840
<1-1,Sheldon>第二天
<1-1,Sheldon>day two.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,360
<1-1,Sheldon>现在是深夜2点25
<1-1,Sheldon>It's 2:25 A.M.,

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,610
<1-1,Sheldon>我有一股强烈的尿意
<1-1,Sheldon>and I feel the urge to urinate.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,070
<1-1,Sheldon>我正常的晨尿时间是早上7点10分
<1-1,Sheldon>My normal urination time is 7:10 A.M.,

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,690
<1-1,Sheldon>但在这夜半时刻
<1-1,Sheldon>but here I am, in the middle of the night,

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,840
<1-1,Sheldon>我却挣扎着要保持头脑清晰
<1-1,Sheldon>struggling to keep my mind sharp

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,400
<1-1,Sheldon>与睡衣裤干燥
<1-1,Sheldon>and my pajamas dry.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,950
<1-1,Sheldon>迟早有一天
<1-1,Sheldon>It's only a matter of time

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,920
<1-1,Sheldon>我对现实薄弱的掌握力就会消失
<1-1,Sheldon>before my tenuous grasp on reality fades.

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,640
<1-1,Sheldon>还是趁没忘记什么是厕所前  赶紧去尿吧
<1-1,Sheldon>I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,590
<2-1,Leonard>你什么时候开始哼歌了
<2-1,Leonard>Since when do you hum songs?

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,670
<2-2,Sheldon>你说啥呢
<2-2,Sheldon>What are you talking about?

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,700
<2-3,Leonard>你刚才在哼歌
<2-3,Leonard>You were just humming.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,690
<2-4,Sheldon>你确定吗
<2-4,Sheldon>Are you sure?

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,030
<2-4,Sheldon>有时候当我脑筋运转飞快
<2-4,Sheldon>Sometimes when my brain really gets moving,

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,360
<2-4,Sheldon>也会发出声音
<2-4,Sheldon>it makes noise.

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,600
<2-5,Leonard>那你的大脑对于
<2-5,Leonard>How does your brain feel about

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,310
<2-5,Leonard>计算畴壁的表面张力怎么看
<2-5,Leonard>calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,050
<2-5,Leonard>我看看
<2-5,Leonard>Let's see.

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,030
<2-6,Sheldon>我还真是在哼歌
<2-6,Sheldon>Hey! I was humming.

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,990
<2-6,Sheldon>赫奇帕奇加一分
<2-6,Sheldon>One point for Hufflepuff.

<2-6,Sheldon>该学院学生多为勤能补拙型的学生

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,700
<2-6,Sheldon>这是什么歌啊
<2-6,Sheldon>What song is that?

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,990
<2-7,Leonard>你再哼一次
<2-7,Leonard>Well... Hum it again.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,570
<2-7,Leonard>是《海绵宝宝》的主题曲吗
<2-7,Leonard>Is that the SpongeBob song?

28
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,510
<2-8,Sheldon (singing)>♪  是谁住在深海的大凤梨里 ♪
<2-8,Sheldon (singing)>♪  Who lives in a pineapple? ♪

29
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,660
<2-8,Sheldon (singing)>不是
<2-8,Sheldon (singing)>Nope.

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,040
<2-9,Leonard>随便啦  能回到正题吗
<2-9,Leonard>Whatever. Can we just get back to this?

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,290
<2-10,Sheldon>我总感觉我知道这首歌
<2-10,Sheldon>I feel like I know what song that is,

32
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,800
<2-10,Sheldon>但就是想不起是哪一首
<2-10,Sheldon>but I can't put my finger on it.

<2-11,Leonard>只是歌曲卡脑里[耳虫]了  会想起来的
<2-11,Leonard>It's just an earworm. It'll come to you.

37
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,450
<2-11,Leonard>好吧

<2-13,Leonard>我们今晚余下时间都要这样吗
<2-13,Leonard>Is this what we're doing the rest of the night?

<2-14,Sheldon (singing)>您好  是的  我希望你们能帮一下我
<2-14,Sheldon (singing)>Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me.

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,080
<2-14,Sheldon (singing)>这首歌是什么歌呢
<2-14,Sheldon (singing)>What song is this?

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,130
<2-14,Sheldon (singing)>你不知道吗
<2-14,Sheldon (singing)>You don't know?

56
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,980
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>你们怎么好意思称自己为"摇滚名人堂"呢
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

58
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,890
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我的老天  你就是用这张脏嘴来
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits

59
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,260
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>跟唱猫王的传世杰作吗
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>of Elvis Presley with that mouth?

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,450
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>他们一点屁用都没有
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Well, they were no help at all.

61
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,400
<3-2,Leonard>真"不敢置信"啊
<3-2,Leonard>Which is crazy,

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,110
<3-2,Leonard>毕竟摇滚最讲究良好的客户服务了
<3-2,Leonard>since rock and roll is all about good customer service.

63
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,010
<3-3,Penny>你脑子里卡了一首歌
<3-3,Penny>Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head.

64
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,150
<3-3,Penny>这在大家身上都发生过啊
<3-3,Penny>It happens to everybody.

65
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,640
<3-4,Sheldon>我不是大家  我有过目不忘的记忆力
<3-4,Sheldon>Well, I'm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory.

66
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,270
<3-4,Sheldon>我应该要能记住这是哪首歌的
<3-4,Sheldon>I should be able to remember what song this is,

67
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,430
<3-4,Sheldon>可我就是想不起来
<3-4,Sheldon>but I can't.

68
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,090
<3-4,Sheldon>我脑子肯定哪里有问题
<3-4,Sheldon>Something's wrong with me.

69
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,210
<3-5,Penny>我就说如果我们够耐心  他会自己发现这事
<3-5,Penny>I told you if we were patient, he'd figure it out for himself.

70
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,370
<3-6,Sheldon>我从以前就很害怕这天的到来
<3-6,Sheldon>Oh... I was always afraid this day would come.

71
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,060
<3-6,Sheldon>这可能是我变成疯子的第一步
<3-6,Sheldon>This might be the first step of my descent into madness,

72
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,100
<3-6,Sheldon>然后我逐步探底直至在公众场合裸露
<3-6,Sheldon>where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.

73
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,290
<3-7,Penny>公众场合裸露吗
<3-7,Penny>Public nudity?

74
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,740
<3-8,Leonard>那只是意味着没穿袜子罢了
<3-8,Leonard>Eh, that just means going barefoot.

75
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:24,970
<4-1,Dave (voice on phone)>您好
<4-1,Dave (voice on phone)>Hello?

76
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,300
<4-2,Amy>戴夫  你好
<4-2,Amy>Hi, Dave.

77
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,770
<4-2,Amy>我是艾米
<4-2,Amy>Uh, it's Amy.

78
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,650
<4-3,Dave>你好吗
<4-3,Dave>Oh. How are you?

79
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,090
<4-4,Amy>我很好  你呢
<4-4,Amy>I'm fine. How are you?

80
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,570
<4-5,Dave>也很好啊  你打来真让我又惊又喜
<4-5,Dave>Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you,

81
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,850
<4-5,Dave>毕竟上次约会时我的表现不太出色
<4-5,Dave>given how I acted on our last date.

82
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,150
<4-6,Amy>我们俩都有不好的地方嘛
<4-6,Amy>Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know.

83
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,470
<4-6,Amy>我吃了最后一根面包棒  你不停提我前任
<4-6,Amy>I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend

84
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,200
<4-6,Amy>就像我前任讨论他爱的《星际旅行》演员一样
<4-6,Amy>like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.

85
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,030
<4-7,Dave>所以今天什么风把你吹来
<4-7,Dave>So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

86
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,840
<4-8,Amy>我有点好奇
<4-8,Amy>Well, I was wondering

87
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,260
<4-8,Amy>你有没有兴趣找个时间再共进晚餐
<4-8,Amy>if you'd like to get dinner again sometime.

88
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,790
<4-9,Dave>好的  没问题
<4-9,Dave>Yes, please.

89
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,220
<4-10,Amy>太好了
<4-10,Amy>Great.

90
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,030
<4-11,Dave>让我看一下行程表  他说道
<4-11,Dave>Let me just check my schedule, he said,

91
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,810
<4-11,Dave>好像他行程表上真有安排一样
<4-11,Dave>trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.

92
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,220
<4-12,Amy>这周六如何
<4-12,Amy>How 'bout Saturday?

93
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,570
<4-13,Dave>我看看
<4-13,Dave>Uh, hmm...Let me see.

94
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,990
<4-13,Dave>周五跟大牌嘻哈歌手去农贸市场
<4-13,Dave>Uh, Friday, farmers' market with Jay Z.

95
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,510
<4-13,Dave>周日跟歌手艾尔顿·约翰去买钢琴
<4-13,Dave>Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John.

96
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,920
<4-13,Dave>周六行啊
<4-13,Dave>Saturday works.

97
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,450
<5-1,Raj>你知道联合国里
<5-1,Raj>Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations,

98
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,320
<5-1,Raj>有一个外层空间事务部门吗
<5-1,Raj>there's a Department for Outer Space Affairs?

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,890
<5-2,Howard>真的吗  为啥要这部门
<5-2,Howard>Really? Why?

100
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,450
<5-3,Raj>以防哪天真有机会跟外星文明接触
<5-3,Raj>They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.

101
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,000
<5-4,Howard>这种工作大概就是无聊  无聊
<5-4,Howard>Mm, boy, that's one of those jobs that's boring, boring,

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
<5-4,Howard>无聊到死  突然"哇靠
<5-4,Howard>boring, then, "Oh, God!

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,160
<5-4,Howard>我们该怎么做的备忘录放哪去了"
<5-4,Howard>Where's the memo with what we do now?!"

104
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,330
<5-5,Raj>这挺酷
<5-5,Raj>Oh, this is cool.

105
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,730
<5-5,Raj>几周前呢
<5-5,Raj>So, a few weeks ago,

106
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,430
<5-5,Raj>我在脸书上给我们乐团开了个粉丝页...
<5-5,Raj>I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and...

107
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,900
<5-6,Howard>等等
<5-6,Howard>Wait a second.

108
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,820
<5-6,Howard>你怎么可以不问过我就做这种事
<5-6,Howard>How could you do that without consulting me?

109
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,750
<5-7,Raj>这又不是什么大事
<5-7,Raj>It's not a big deal.

110
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,180
<5-7,Raj>就花五分钟就能弄好的东西
<5-7,Raj>It just took, like, five minutes to set up.

111
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,810
<5-8,Howard>这不是重点
<5-8,Howard>That's not the point.

112
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,990
<5-8,Howard>我们创立"月球足迹"乐团时
<5-8,Howard>When we created Footprints on the Moon,

113
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,160
<5-8,Howard>说好乐团所有决定都得经过两人同意
<5-8,Howard>we agreed that every band decision would be mutual.

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,860
<5-8,Howard>你现在就是想独揽一切
<5-8,Howard>Now you're just trying to take over the whole thing.

115
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,040
<5-8,Howard>或许我该单飞
<5-8,Howard>You know, maybe I should go solo.

116
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,200
<5-9,Raj>但有人加了我们的粉丝页
<5-9,Raj>But someone joined our page.

117
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,730
<5-9,Raj>我们有一个粉丝了
<5-9,Raj>We have an actual fan.

118
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,970
<5-10,Howard>好吧  这事比咱俩重要
<5-10,Howard>All right. This thing's bigger than you and me--

119
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,880
<5-10,Howard>乐团重组
<5-10,Howard>band's back together.

120
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,300
<5-11,Raj>你听他写了什么
<5-11,Raj>So, listen to what he wrote.

121
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,820
<5-11,Raj>"我看到你们在漫画店的演出
<5-11,Raj>Uh, "I saw you play at the comic book store.

122
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,290
<5-11,Raj>你们屌爆了"
<5-11,Raj>You guys rock."

123
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,360
<5-11,Raj>然后还有一张笑脸的动图
<5-11,Raj>And then there's a animated smiley face

124
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,960
<5-11,Raj>像嗨到要掀了房顶一样
<5-11,Raj>raising the roof like this...

125
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,850
<5-12,Howard>那晚我们的确是嗨爆了全场
<5-12,Howard>We did raise the roof that night.

126
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,070
<5-13,Raj>绝对啊
<5-13,Raj>Yeah, we totally did.

127
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,370
<5-14,Howard>摇滚明星为啥要嗑药啊  这感觉明明爽炸了
<5-14,Howard>Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?

<7-3,Bernadette>他不停地说自己有多爱谢尔顿

<7-6,Amy>他会来家里  这次是我要下厨

169
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,990
<7-9,Bernadette>这是很亲密的事
<7-9,Bernadette>It's intimate.

173
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,800
<7-10,Amy>而戴夫喜欢我
<7-10,Amy>Dave likes me.

174
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,360
<7-10,Amy>或许我需要的就是亲密
<7-10,Amy>Maybe intimate is what I need.

175
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,920
<7-10,Amy>你确定吗
<7-10,Amy>You sure?

<10-7,Sheldon>Oh, no, he's drinking it.

249
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,240
<11-1,Howard>看看这个
<11-1,Howard>Look at this.

250
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,440
<11-1,Howard>特伦特在组装古董摩托车
<11-1,Howard>Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.

251
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,100
<11-2,Raj>那真是太酷了
<11-2,Raj>That is so cool!

252
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,760
<11-2,Raj>老旧坏掉的东西远比
<11-2,Raj>Old broken things are so much better

253
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,810
<11-2,Raj>全新能用的赞太多了
<11-2,Raj>than new things that work.

254
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,390
<11-3,Bernadette>谁是特伦特
<11-3,Bernadette>Who's Trent?

255
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,980
<11-4,Howard>他是我们的粉丝
<11-4,Howard>Oh, he's our fan.

256
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,400
<11-5,Bernadette>粉你们什么
<11-5,Bernadette>Fan of what?

257
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,020
<11-6,Howard>你忘了吗  我俩组了个乐团啊
<11-6,Howard>Did you forget? We're in a band.

258
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,090
<11-7,Bernadette>就因为你们在漫画店演出过一次吗
<11-7,Bernadette>You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?

259
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,900
<11-8,Howard>还有儿童医院  虽然最后被人赶走了
<11-8,Howard>And at the children's hospital until they asked us to leave.

260
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,990
<11-9,Raj>兄弟
<11-9,Raj>Hey, dude,

261
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,880
<11-9,Raj>特伦特刚在一家费尔奥克斯的咖啡店签到
<11-9,Raj>Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.

262
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,100
<11-10,Howard>真的吗  你想去见见他吗
<11-10,Howard>Really? You want to go down there and meet him?

263
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,460
<11-11,Bernadette>你们要跟踪人家吗  太变态了吧
<11-11,Bernadette>Are you stalking him? That's creepy.

264
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,900
<11-12,Raj>那不是变态
<11-12,Raj>It's not creepy.

265
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,790
<11-12,Raj>我创建了我们乐团的主页  特伦特加了进来
<11-12,Raj>I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.

266
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,370
<11-13,Howard>在那之后  我只需点开他的个人档案
<11-13,Howard>After that, all I did was check out his profile,

267
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,840
<11-13,Howard>查找他以前发表的东西
<11-13,Howard>go back in the archive of his feed

268
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,100
<11-13,Howard>直到找到他的推特用户名
<11-13,Howard>until I found his Twitter handle.

269
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,530
<11-14,Raj>然后就很容易在照片分享应用上找到他
<11-14,Raj>From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat

270
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,050
<11-14,Raj>接着就能掌握他的一举一动了
<11-14,Raj>and pretty much track his every movement.

271
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,660
<11-15,Howard>如果你觉得这样很变态  那你可真是嫁错人了
<11-15,Howard>So if you think that's creepy, you married the wrong guy.

272
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,480
<11-16,Bernadette>或许我该嫁给特伦特
<11-16,Bernadette>Maybe I should marry Trent.

273
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,180
<11-17,Raj>是啊  那也得她泡得到他啊
<11-17,Raj>Yeah, like she could get Trent.

274
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,900
<12-1,Dave>真是太好吃了
<12-1,Dave>This is delicious.

275
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,040
<12-2,Amy>谢谢
<12-2,Amy>Thank you.

276
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,670
<12-3,Dave>我很久没吃过家常饭了
<12-3,Dave>Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.

277
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,810
<12-4,Amy>你结婚之后  你的妻子不做饭吗
<12-4,Amy>When you were married, did your wife cook?

278
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,250
<12-5,Dave>一开始不做
<12-5,Dave>Not at first, no.

279
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,490
<12-5,Dave>但在她背着我跟一个法国大厨偷情之后
<12-5,Dave>But when she began cheating on me with a French chef,

280
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,020
<12-5,Dave>她快变成了特级厨师
<12-5,Dave>she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.

281
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,370
<12-6,Amy>也算一丝慰籍吧
<12-6,Amy>So, a little silver lining.

282
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,860
<12-7,Dave>算是吧
<12-7,Dave>I suppose. Yeah.

283
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,170
<12-7,Dave>没有什么比一碗精心调味的法式洋葱汤
<12-7,Dave>Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life

284
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,290
<12-7,Dave>更能让破碎的生活变得好接受了
<12-7,Dave>like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup.

285
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,720
<12-7,Dave>你住在这里多久了
<12-7,Dave>How long have you, uh, lived here?

286
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,290
<12-8,Amy>大概五年了
<12-8,Amy>About five years.

287
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,200
<12-8,Amy>我其实正打算搬去一间更好的公寓
<12-8,Amy>I'm actually thinking of moving to a better place

288
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,180
<12-8,Amy>因为我现在不用住得那么近好去载...
<12-8,Amy>now that I don't need to be so close to...

289
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,550
<12-8,Amy>你懂的
<12-8,Amy>Well, you know.

290
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,910
<12-9,Dave>我懂  那位出色的物理学家
<12-9,Dave>I do. The brilliant physicist

291
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,660
<12-9,Dave>我现在知道他也住附近了  不过我"毫不关心"
<12-9,Dave>that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.

292
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
<12-10,Amy>总之  他不开车
<12-10,Amy>Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive,

293
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,940
<12-10,Amy>所以他去哪儿基本都得要我载
<12-10,Amy>so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.

294
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,190
<12-11,Dave>你是逼于无奈  还是三生有幸
<12-11,Dave>Had to or got to?

295
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,990
<12-12,Amy>-抱歉  -我的错
<12-12,Amy>- Sorry. - My fault.

296
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,050
<12-12,Amy>-是我先提他  -是啊
<12-12,Amy>- I brought him up. - Yeah.

297
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,450
<12-13,Dave>我们换个话题吧
<12-13,Dave>Well, let's change the subject.

298
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,900
<12-13,Dave>不要再提那个谁了
<12-13,Dave>No more mentions of you-know-who.

299
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,010
<12-13,Dave>那火车好酷啊
<12-13,Dave>That's a cool train.

300
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,800
<12-13,Dave>你从哪里买的
<12-13,Dave>Where did you get that?

301
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,410
<13-1,Sheldon>这歌真是根本停不下来啊
<13-1,Sheldon>This song is never going to stop.

302
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,580
<13-1,Sheldon>你们遇到过这种烦人无极限的事物吗
<13-1,Sheldon>Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?

303
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,170
<13-2,Leonard>这是陷阱题  对吧
<13-2,Leonard>That's a trick question, right?

304
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,700
<13-3,Sheldon>我不应该感到惊讶
<13-3,Sheldon>Well, I shouldn't be surprised.

305
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,320
<13-3,Sheldon>历史上有不少的睿智之士最后沦为了疯子
<13-3,Sheldon>There's a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.

306
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,380
<13-4,Penny>拜托  谢尔顿
<13-4,Penny>Come on, Sheldon.

307
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,300
<13-4,Penny>还有好多不是疯子的聪明人呢
<13-4,Penny>There are plenty of smart people who don't have mental problems.

308
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,220
<13-5,Leonard>她说得对
<13-5,Leonard>Yup, she's right.

309
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,320
<13-5,Leonard>这世上每有一个精神病牛顿
<13-5,Leonard>For every Newton who had a psychological issue,

310
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,940
<13-5,Leonard>就会有一个混蛋爱迪生
<13-5,Leonard>there's an Edison who was just a jerk.

311
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,000
<13-5,Leonard>这混蛋完全有可能是你嘛
<13-5,Leonard>That could totally be you.

312
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,240
<13-6,Sheldon>恩培多克勒以为他是天神  跳进了火山
<13-6,Sheldon>Empedocles thought he was a God and jumped into a volcano.

313
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,500
<13-6,Sheldon>毕达哥拉斯对豆子有莫名的恐惧
<13-6,Sheldon>And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans.

315
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,610
<13-6,Sheldon>特斯拉疯狂地爱上了一只鸽子
<13-6,Sheldon>Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon

316
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,890
<13-6,Sheldon>还声称那只鸽子也爱他
<13-6,Sheldon>who he claimed loved him back.

317
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,480
<13-7,Penny>也许是他口袋里有面包
<13-7,Penny>Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.

318
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,920
<13-8,Sheldon>这个名单可以延伸到科学界之外
<13-8,Sheldon>The list extends outside of science.

319
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,590
<13-8,Sheldon>比如像梵高和波洛克那样的画家
<13-8,Sheldon>Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock,

320
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,380
<13-8,Sheldon>国际象棋大师鲍比·菲舍尔

325
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,550
<13-8,Sheldon>是"海滩男孩"的《亲爱的》
<13-8,Sheldon>It's called "Darlin'" by the Beach Boys!

326

329
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,560
<13-9,Leonard>他住屋顶鸽舍的事看来是没指望了
<13-9,Leonard>There goes our shot at him living on the roof.

330
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,680
<14-1,Raj>好了  就是他
<14-1,Raj>So, all right, there he is.

331
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,810
<14-1,Raj>我们主动上前自我介绍吗
<14-1,Raj>So, should we introduce ourselves?

332
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,090
<14-2,Howard>别  让他自己发现我们
<14-2,Howard>No! Let him spot us.

333
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,500
<14-3,Raj>他会不会正听着我们的歌呢
<14-3,Raj>I wonder if he's listening to our music right now.

334
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,620
<14-4,Howard>你能想象吗
<14-4,Howard>Could you imagine?

335
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,870
<14-4,Howard>多么酷的见面方式啊
<14-4,Howard>What a cool way for us to meet.

336
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,220
<14-4,Howard>他听着我们的歌  一抬头我们正在他眼前
<14-4,Howard>He's playing our song and looks up, and there we are--

338
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,840
<14-5,Raj>他一定会说
<14-5,Raj>And he's, all, like,

339
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,790
<14-5,Raj>"你们不是月球足迹乐团的..."
<14-5,Raj>"Aren't you the guys from Footprints on the Moo...?"

340
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,600
<14-5,Raj>他在干什么啊
<14-5,Raj>Ooh, what is he doing?!

341
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,920
<14-6,Howard>我看不下去了
<14-6,Howard>I can't watch.

342
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,000
<14-6,Howard>没  没关系
<14-6,Howard>I-I-It's okay.

343

<14-7,Raj>没关系  他已经抠完了
<14-7,Raj>Oh, it's okay. He's done.

344
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,540
<14-8,Howard>他干嘛要盯着那玩意看
<14-8,Howard>Why is he looking at it?!

345
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,810
<14-9,Raj>他该不会想吃了那玩意吧
<14-9,Raj>Eh, no, he's not going to eat it, is he?

346
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,500

353
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,850
<15-1,Sheldon>卡在我脑海里
<15-1,Sheldon>that was stuck in my head.

354
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,350
<15-2,Leonard>我也不知道  这歌朗朗上口呀
<15-2,Leonard>I don't know. It's pretty catchy.

355
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,350

<15-4,Sheldon>你觉得呢
<15-4,Sheldon>What do you think?

358
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,330

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,070
<15-7,Penny>为什么
<15-7,Penny>Why?

364
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,860
<15-8,Sheldon>和艾米有关
<15-8,Sheldon>It's about Amy.

365
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,150
<15-9,Penny>我知道艾米举止打扮像个老太太
<15-9,Penny>Okay, look, I know Amy's like an old lady,

366
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,650
<15-9,Penny>但她也不至于老到被唱进
<15-9,Penny>but she's not old enough to have a song

367
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,850
<15-9,Penny>一首60年代的歌里吧
<15-9,Penny>from the '60s written about her.

368
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,320
<15-10,Sheldon>她让我的人生变得更美好
<15-10,Sheldon>It's about how she made my life better.

369
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,580
<15-10,Sheldon>想想这歌词吧
<15-10,Sheldon>Consider the lyrics.

370
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,700
<15-10,Sheldon>"从前的我灵魂从未完整
<15-10,Sheldon>"I was living like half a man.

371
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,280
<15-10,Sheldon>从前的我不会爱  现在的我已会爱
<15-10,Sheldon>Then I couldn't love, but now I can.

372
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,630
<15-10,Sheldon>灵魂从此变得完整
<15-10,Sheldon>More soul than I ever had.

373
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,470
<15-10,Sheldon>我爱你将我的心变得柔软"
<15-10,Sheldon>I love the way you soften my life."

374
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,150
<15-11,Penny>她的确让你变得柔软了  不是吗
<15-11,Penny>Well, she did soften your life, didn't she?

375
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,510
<15-11,Penny>没错
<15-11,Penny>Yes!

376
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,610
<15-12,Sheldon>她就是我的心灵柔顺剂
<15-12,Sheldon>She's like the dryer sheets of my heart!

377
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,110
<15-12,Sheldon>我得走了
<15-12,Sheldon>I have to go.

378
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,950
<15-13,Leonard>我也是你的心灵柔顺剂吗
<15-13,Leonard>Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?

379
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,820
<15-14,Penny>不止  你可是我"爱的绒毛清除器"
<15-14,Penny>Better. You're the lint trap of my love.

380
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,030
<16-1,Amy>这个领带夹还挺有趣的
<16-1,Amy>That's an interesting tie clip.

381
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,960
<16-2,Dave>谢谢
<16-2,Dave>Oh, thanks.

382
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,310
<16-2,Dave>这是阿伏伽德罗常量
<16-2,Dave>It's, uh, Avogadro's constant.

383
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,140
<16-2,Dave>可以用来计算物质中的原子数
<16-2,Dave>It's useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance,

384
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,970
<16-2,Dave>或是让每个提问者后悔自己提了这问题
<16-2,Dave>or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.

385
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,670
<16-3,Amy>我...
<16-3,Amy>Oh, I...

386
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,340
<16-3,Amy>我觉得挺不错的
<16-3,Amy>I think it's neat.

387
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,830
<16-4,Dave>对不起  对不起
<16-4,Dave>Sorry. Sorry.

388
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,180
<16-4,Dave>从来没人喜欢过这个领带夹
<16-4,Dave>No one's ever liked the tie clip before,

389
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,210
<16-4,Dave>所以我就失控了
<16-4,Dave>so I just lost all control.

390
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,260
<16-5,Amy>不  没关系  我们本来就在约会
<16-5,Amy>No, it... it's okay, and we are on a date.

391
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,730
<16-5,Amy>我只是有点紧张
<16-5,Amy>I'm... I'm just a little nervous.

392
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,840
<16-6,Dave>你无需对我紧张
<16-6,Dave>Well, no need to be nervous with me.

393
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,400
<16-6,Dave>我只是一个来自异国  人畜无害的巨人
<16-6,Dave>I'm just a harmless giant from a foreign land.

394
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,900
<16-7,Amy>我只是犯傻而已  我...
<16-7,Amy>You know, I'm just being silly. I...

395
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,370
<16-7,Amy>我不知道我还在等什么
<16-7,Amy>I don't know what I'm waiting for.

396
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,810
<16-8,Sheldon>艾米
<16-8,Sheldon>Amy?

397
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,190
<16-8,Sheldon>艾米
<16-8,Sheldon>Amy.

398
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,920
<16-8,Sheldon>艾米
<16-8,Sheldon>Amy?

399
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,270
<16-9,Amy>那是谢尔顿
<16-9,Amy>That's Sheldon.

400
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,200
<16-10,Dave>你开玩笑的吧  我头发乱不乱
<16-10,Dave>You're kidding! How's my hair?

401
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,940
<16-11,Amy>谢尔顿  你来的真不凑巧
<16-11,Amy>Sheldon, this-this isn't a good time.

402
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,960
<16-11,Amy>我才不管呢
<16-11,Amy>I don't care.

403
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,260
<16-12,Sheldon>艾米  有一首歌总是在我脑海盘旋
<16-12,Sheldon>Amy, there was a song I couldn't get out of my head.

404
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,300
<16-12,Sheldon>最后我终于发现  这歌和你有关
<16-12,Sheldon>Eventually, I realized the song was about you,

405
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,000
<16-12,Sheldon>你是我挥之不去的耳虫  久久盘旋在心口
<16-12,Sheldon>and like that earworm, I can't get you out of my heart.

406
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,040
<16-12,Sheldon>所以我想告诉你
<16-12,Sheldon>So, what I'm trying to say is,

407
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,190
<16-12,Sheldon>你是我的心虫
<16-12,Sheldon>you're my heartworm.

408
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,880
<16-12,Sheldon>这是比喻  不是指真的犬心丝虫
<16-12,Sheldon>The metaphorical kind, not-not the poodle-killing kind.

409
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,230
<16-13,Amy>你说什么
<16-13,Amy>W-W-W-What?

410
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,180
<16-14,Dave>打扰一下...
<16-14,Dave>If I may...

411
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,390
<16-14,Dave>我觉得他是在用
<16-14,Dave>I believe what he's saying,

412
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,810
<16-14,Dave>一种更诗意更抒情的方式表达
<16-14,Dave>in a charming and delightful way,

413
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,230
<16-14,Dave>他很爱你  希望你能回到他身边
<16-14,Dave>is that he loves you and wants you back.

414
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,090
<16-14,Dave>戴夫·吉布斯  您的铁杆粉丝

417
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,260
<16-16,Amy>不  没关系  你继续说
<16-16,Amy>No, it-it... it's okay. Keep going?
