1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,500
<1-1,Sheldon>每次看这部电影  我都很困惑
<1-1,Sheldon>This movie baffles me every time we watch it.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,950
<1-2,Leonard>什么意思
<1-2,Leonard>What do you mean?

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,000
<1-3,Sheldon>指南说得一清二楚
<1-3,Sheldon>The instructions are very clear:

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,240
<1-3,Sheldon>午夜后别喂魔怪
<1-3,Sheldon>"don't feed the gremlins after midnight."

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,920
<1-3,Sheldon>别弄湿魔怪
<1-3,Sheldon>"don't get the gremlins wet."

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,930
<1-3,Sheldon>这能有多难
<1-3,Sheldon>How hard is that?

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,850
<1-4,Penny (arriving)>伙计们好啊
<1-4,Penny (arriving)>Hi, guys.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,850
<1-4,Penny (arriving)>好啊  亲爱的
<1-4,Penny (arriving)>Hi, honey.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,830
<1-5,Leonard>好
<1-5,Leonard>Hey.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,750
<1-6,Howard>都已经是"亲爱的"啦
<1-6,Howard>Ooh, we're "honey" now, are we?

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,490
<1-7,Sheldon>对  自从他们发展至肉体关系
<1-7,Sheldon>Yes. Since their relationship become carnal,

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,110
<1-7,Sheldon>佩妮就升级了对他的爱称
<1-7,Sheldon>Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment,

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,610
<1-7,Sheldon>跟她称为"甜心"的人区分
<1-7,Sheldon>Thus distinguishing him from those she calls "sweetie,"

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,290
<1-7,Sheldon>通常为了略微消减隐含的讽刺之意
<1-7,Sheldon>Usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,630
<1-8,Penny>别这么无聊  "甜心"
<1-8,Penny>You're boring people, "sweetie".

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,940
<1-9,Sheldon>但有时她就是赤裸裸的讽刺
<1-9,Sheldon>Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,400
<1-10,Penny>你们在干什么
<1-10,Penny>So, what are you guys doing?

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,210
<1-11,Howard>庆祝哥伦布发现美洲纪念日
<1-11,Howard>Celebrating Columbus day.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,660
<1-12,Leonard>我们在看《七宝奇谋》《小魔怪》《少年福尔摩斯》
<1-12,Leonard>We're watching goonies, gremlins and young sherlock holmes.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,280
<1-12,Leonard>都是克里斯·哥伦布的作品
<1-12,Leonard>They're all written by Chris Columbus.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,510
<1-12,Leonard>好啊
<1-12,Leonard>Okay.

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,250
<1-13,Penny>那你们感恩节看什么
<1-13,Penny>What do you watch on thanksgiving?

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,420
<1-14,Sheldon>游行
<1-14,Sheldon>The parade.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,220
<1-15,Penny>这倒是提醒了我
<1-15,Penny>Oh, you know, that reminds me--

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,940
<1-15,Penny>我通常回内布拉斯加过感恩节
<1-15,Penny>I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving,

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,420
<1-15,Penny>但今年取消了
<1-15,Penny>But this year they're calling it off,

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,230
<1-15,Penny>因为我哥哥被人告了
<1-15,Penny>On account of my brother's trial.

28
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,930
<1-16,Leonard>为什么
<1-16,Leonard>What's he on trial for?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,810
<1-17,Penny>只是个误会
<1-17,Penny>Oh, just a big misunderstanding.

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,400
<1-17,Penny>你应该会喜欢我哥哥
<1-17,Penny>You know, you'd actually like my brother.

31
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,320
<1-17,Penny>他也算是个化学家
<1-17,Penny>He's kind of a chemist.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,240
<1-17,Penny>既然我今年在这里过感恩节
<1-17,Penny>Anyway, I was thinking I'd have thanksgiving here,

33
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,570
<1-17,Penny>你们都要来
<1-17,Penny>And you are all invited.

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,620
<1-18,Leonard>我会去的
<1-18,Leonard>Oh. I'll be there.

35
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,710
<1-19,Sheldon>你是用蔓越橘果冻
<1-19,Sheldon>Will you be serving cranberry jelly

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,810
<1-19,Sheldon>还是蔓越橘酱招待客人
<1-19,Sheldon>Or cranberry sauce?

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,600
<1-20,Penny>估计两个都有
<1-20,Penny>I guess I could serve both.

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,450
<1-21,Sheldon>估计  貌似你对这方面不在行
<1-21,Sheldon>You guess? You don't seem to have much of a handle on this.

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,500
<1-22,Howard>佩妮  我很想参加  但每年
<1-22,Howard>Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year,

40
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,010
<1-22,Howard>我妈都请所有亲戚过来
<1-22,Howard>My mother has all the relatives over and cooks up

41
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,440
<1-23,Penny>做传说中的鸡胸鱼
<1-23,Penny>Her famous tur-briska-fil.

42
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,680
<1-23,Penny>鸡脯鱼?
<1-23,Penny>Tur-briska-fil?

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,130
<1-24,Howard>火鸡包胸脯肉杂  胸脯肉里包鱼丸
<1-24,Howard>Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish.

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,190
<1-24,Howard>没听起来那么好吃
<1-24,Howard>It's not as good as it sounds.

45
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,770
<1-25,Penny>拉杰  你呢
<1-25,Penny>Raj, what about you?

46
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,660
<1-26,Howard>他通常都去我家过节  对吧
<1-26,Howard>Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?

47
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,150
<1-26,Howard>好啦  今年不逼你
<1-26,Howard>All right, this year, you don't have to

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
<1-26,Howard>吃鸡脯鱼啦
<1-26,Howard>Eat the tur-briska-fil.

49
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,450
<1-26,Howard>我根本不嚼
<1-26,Howard>I don't even chew it.

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
<1-26,Howard>直接当药丸吞
<1-26,Howard>I swallow it like pills.

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,700
<2-1,Leonard>拉杰怎么了
<2-1,Leonard>So, what's going on with Raj?

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,650
<2-2,Howard>好消息是
<2-2,Howard>Well, the good news is,

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
<2-2,Howard>我对我妈的鸡脯鱼没意见
<2-2,Howard>He has no problem with my mother's tur-brka-fil.

55
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,800
<2-3,Penny>真不敢相信  继续说
<2-3,Penny>Hard to believe, but go on.

56
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,020
<2-4,Howard>坏消息是  他要被驱逐出境了
<2-4,Howard>The bad news is, he says he'getting deported.

57
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,210
<2-4,Howard>他要被驱逐出境
<2-4,Howard>What do you mean,

58
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,580
<2-5,Leonard>是什么意思
<2-5,Leonard>He's getting deported?

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,360
<2-6,Sheldon>意思是美国政府
<2-6,Sheldon>I believe it means that the U.S. Government

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,960
<2-6,Sheldon>要驱赶他离开本国
<2-6,Sheldon>Is going to expel him from the country.

61
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,050
<2-6,Sheldon>他要么回印度老家
<2-6,Sheldon>He could then either return to his native india,

62
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,170
<2-6,Sheldon>要么移居接受他的国家
<2-6,Sheldon>Emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him,

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,020
<2-6,Sheldon>或者去公海当个无国籍海盗
<2-6,Sheldon>Or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate.

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,490
<2-6,Sheldon>要是我  我就选海盗
<2-6,Sheldon>Personally, I'd choose pirate.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,010
<2-7,Howard>佩妮  你能不能先出去
<2-7,Howard>Penny, would you mind stepping outside

66
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,330
<2-7,Howard>我们才能和他谈谈
<2-7,Howard>So we can speak to him?

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,350
<2-7,Howard>好吧
<2-7,Howard>Fine.

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,820
<2-8,Penny>但他也该改改不敢跟女生说话的毛病了
<2-8,Penny>But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.

69
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,390
<2-9,Sheldon>这也是考虑做海盗的理由
<2-9,Sheldon>Another reason to consider life of piracy.

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,410
<2-9,Sheldon>即使是今天  海盗仍是男性职业
<2-9,Sheldon>Even today, I unrstand that's an all-male profession.

71
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,730
<2-10,Howard>好了  她走了
<2-10,Howard>Okay, she's go.

72
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,920
<2-11,Raj>对不起  我失态了
<2-11,Raj>Sorry. I lost my cool.

73
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,600
<2-12,Leonard>怎么回事
<2-12,Leonard>So, what's going on?

74
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,090
<2-13,Raj>事情是这样的
<2-13,Raj>Okay, here's the deal:

75
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,360
<2-13,Raj>六个月前  我的实验
<2-13,Raj>Six months ago, my research testing

76
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,590
<2-13,Raj>测试海王星物体的成分
<2-13,Raj>The predicted composition of trans-neptunian objects

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,050
<2-13,Raj>宣告失败
<2-13,Raj>Ran into a dead end.

78
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,460
<2-14,Howard>所以?
<2-14,Howard>So?

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,180
<2-15,Raj>我的签证只有在大学任聘才有用
<2-15,Raj>So, my visa's only good as long as i employ to the university.

80
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,770
<2-15,Raj>如果他们发现我的实验一无所获
<2-15,Raj>And when they find out that I've got squat,

81
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,700
<2-15,Raj>他们就会裁掉我
<2-15,Raj>They're going to cut me off.

82
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,360
<2-15,Raj>而且  我说的一无所获是一丁点都没有
<2-15,Raj>By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat.

83
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,430
<2-15,Raj>我倒是希望有那么一丁点收获
<2-15,Raj>I wish I had squat.

84
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,900
<2-16,Leonard>等等  那你过去6个月都在做什么
<2-16,Leonard>So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?

85
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,980
<2-17,Raj>收收邮件啦
<2-17,Raj>You know, checking e-mail,

86
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,430
<2-17,Raj>更新FACEBOOK页面啦
<2-17,Raj>Updating my facebook status,

87
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,090
<2-17,Raj>搞搞维基词条啦
<2-17,Raj>Messing up wikipedia entries.

88
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,110
<2-17,Raj>你们知道吗
<2-17,Raj>Hey, do you know netflix

89
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,810
<2-17,Raj>NETFLIX现在允许客户端下载电影了
<2-17,Raj>Lets you stream movies on your computer now?

90
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,990
<2-18,Sheldon>这么说你一直都拿大学的薪水
<2-18,Sheldon>And you've continued to take the university's money

91
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,460
<2-18,Sheldon>蒙混过日子
<2-18,Sheldon>Under false pretenses?

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,280
<2-18,Sheldon>你这个天体物理学家也太没职业道德了
<2-18,Sheldon>Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.

93
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,120
<2-18,Sheldon>不过倒是很适合海盗
<2-18,Sheldon>Although practically mandatory for a pirate.

94
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,590
<2-19,Raj>我不想回印度
<2-19,Raj>I don't want to go back to india.

95
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,290
<2-19,Raj>印度又热又吵  人又多
<2-19,Raj>It's hot and loud, and there's so many people.

96
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,200
<2-19,Raj>你们不知道  到处都是人
<2-19,Raj>You have no idea-- they're everywhere.

97
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,650
<2-20,Howard>伙计们  动动脑子
<2-20,Howard>Okay, guys, think.

98
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,780
<2-20,Howard>怎么才能让拉杰留下来
<2-20,Howard>How do we keep Raj in the country?

99
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,820
<2-21,Penny (from outside)>另找一份工作不就行了
<2-21,Penny (from outside)>Why doesn't he just get another job?

100
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,120
<2-22,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>你问我有什么用
<2-22,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>What are you asking me for?

101
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,000
<2-22,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>我哪知道你能不能说话
<2-22,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>I don't know if you can talk now or not.

102
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,090
<3-1,Raj>牛肉
<3-1,Raj>Oh, beef...

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,490
<3-1,Raj>我会很想念你的
<3-1,Raj>I'm going to miss you so much.

104

<3-1,Raj>知道吗  孟买的麦当劳
<3-1,Raj>Do you know, at the mumbai Mcdonald's,

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,550
<3-1,Raj>没有巨无霸
<3-1,Raj>You can't get a big mac?

106
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,050
<3-1,Raj>只有鸡肉大君麦香堡
<3-1,Raj>All you can get is a chicken maharaja mac.

107
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,140
<3-1,Raj>而特制酱料
<3-1,Raj>And the special sauce--

108
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,850
<3-1,Raj>咖喱  相信我  在印度
<3-1,Raj>Curry-- which, in india, believe you me,

109
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,940
<3-2,Leonard>咖喱一点也不特别
<3-2,Leonard>Is really not that special.

110
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,310
<3-2,Leonard>别担心  能找到工作的
<3-2,Leonard>Don't worry, you'll find another job.

111
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,110
<3-3,Raj>我先练习一下
<3-3,Raj>Yeah,let me start practicing for it.

112
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,280
<3-3,Raj>"要薯条和大君麦香堡吗"
<3-3,Raj>"do you want fries with maharaja mac?"

<3-5,Raj>Hello， Sheldon.

116
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,360
<3-6,Sheldon>不好意思  虽然我还不善长解读面部表情
<3-6,Sheldon>Forgive me, as you know, I'm no adept at reading facial cues,

117
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,210
<3-6,Sheldon>但我想试一试
<3-6,Sheldon>But I'm going to take a stab here:

118
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,360
<3-6,Sheldon>你不是在伤心就是在反胃中
<3-6,Sheldon>You're either sad or nauseated.

119
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,080
<3-8,Sheldon>-我是伤心  -我正准备说伤心的
<3-8,Sheldon>- I'm sad.  - I was going to say sad.

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,530
<3-8,Sheldon>不知道怎么的我犹豫了
<3-8,Sheldon>I don't know why I hedged.

121
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,380
<3-9,Raj>你在吃什么
<3-9,Raj>What are you eating?

<3-12,Leonard>我一直对这事儿有些疑惑
<3-12,Leonard>I've always been a little confused about this.

126
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,760
<3-12,Leonard>为什么印度教不准吃牛肉
<3-12,Leonard>Why don't hindus eat beef?

127
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,750
<3-13,Raj>我们相信牛就是神
<3-13,Raj>We believe cows are gods.

128
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,050
<3-14,Sheldon>学术上说并不准确
<3-14,Sheldon>Not technically.

129
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
<3-14,Sheldon>在印度教中  牛被认为长的像神
<3-14,Sheldon>In hinduism, cattle are thought to be like god.

130
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,340
<3-15,Raj>不需要你教我自家的文化  谢尔顿
<3-15,Raj>Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon!

131
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,500
<3-15,Raj>就我现在的心情  老子会揪你出去的
<3-15,Raj>In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out--

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,810
<3-15,Raj>我向牛发誓
<3-15,Raj>I swear to cow!

133
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,590
<3-16,Sheldon>对不起
<3-16,Sheldon>I'm sorry.

<3-17,Raj>可以理解
<3-17,Raj>Understandle.

<3-18,Sheldon>你的未来充其量也只能说惨淡无光
<3-18,Sheldon>And your future appears bleak at best.

<3-19,Raj>谢谢
<3-19,Raj>Thank you.

140
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,410
<3-20,Sheldon>而且你在印度教和牛的问题上是错的
<3-20,Sheldon>And you're wrong about hinduism and cows.

212
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,930
<5-15,Leonard>就像是无数的动作片里面
<5-15,Leonard>Like the subordinate male protagonist

<5-14,Sheldon>他通常都是在欢呼声中回归的
<5-14,Sheldon>Usually, he's met by cheers.

218
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,140
<5-14,Sheldon>不论如何  我正想着探索
<5-14,Sheldon>Anyway, I was thinking about exploring

<5-14,Sheldon>Of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations,

221
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,810

222
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,230
<5-15,Leonard>打扰一下  谢尔顿
<5-15,Leonard>Excuse me, Sheldon.

223

<5-15,Leonard>通常需要浪费多少卷胶片才能让次要的男主角
<5-15,Leonard>How many reels before the subordine male protagonist

<5-15,Leonard>说到重点上
<5-15,Leonard>Gets to s point?

225
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,240
<5-16,Sheldon>不好意思  如果你没有为我的出场欢呼
<5-16,Sheldon>I'm sorry-- if you didn't cheer at my entrance,

226
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,850
<5-16,Sheldon>那你现在提出你的假设也为时已晚了
<5-16,Sheldon>It's too late to buy into the premise.

227
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,210
<5-16,Sheldon>不管怎么说  我从系主任那里
<5-16,Sheldon>Anyway, I got some extra money

228
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,710
<5-16,Sheldon>获得了多余的资金
<5-16,Sheldon>From the head of the department,

229
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,330
<5-16,Sheldon>而拉杰可以来给我打工

232
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,550

<5-18,Sheldon>You're going to have to listen

233
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,920
<5-18,Sheldon>必须要更仔细的听清我的话
<5-18,Sheldon>More careful when you're on the job.

234
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,340
<5-19,Raj>好吧  但是可别搞错了
<5-19,Raj>Ay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way,

235
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,480
<5-19,Raj>我情愿在乳头上别张纸
<5-19,Raj>But I'd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,080
<9-14,Leonard>独处一会儿
<9-14,Leonard>Alone time.

358
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,140
<9-15,Howard>我明白了  我当电灯泡了
<9-15,Howard>I-I get it, I'm the third wheel.

359
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,520
<9-15,Howard>抱歉  我早该明白的
<9-15,Howard>Sorry, I should have seen that.

360
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,520
<9-15,Howard>我这就走
<9-15,Howard>I'll get out of your way.

361
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,010
<9-15,Howard>还有那些鸡蛋...  快趁热吃吧
<9-15,Howard>You're gonna want to eat those eggs while they're still hot.

362
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,410
<9-15,Howard>谢谢
<9-15,Howard>Thank you.

363
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,430
<9-16,Leonard>冰箱里还有熏鲑鱼和奶油芝士
<9-16,Leonard>There's lox and cream cheese in the fridge.

364
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,690
<9-16,Leonard>百吉饼在烤箱里  我正在加热
<9-16,Leonard>The bagels are in the oven.I was warming them up.

365
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,770
<9-17,Penny>太好了
<9-17,Penny>That's great.

366
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,530
<9-18,Howard>我就去跟我妈呆着好了  反正一直都很好玩的
<9-18,Howard>I'm just going to hang out with my mother.That's always fun.

367
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,730
<9-19,Leonard>很好
<9-19,Leonard>Good.

368
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,210
<9-20,Penny>我们是不是太坏了
<9-20,Penny>Are we terrible people?

369
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,620
<9-20,Penny>我不知道
<9-20,Penny>I don't know.

370
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,060
<9-21,Leonard>那你想让我怎么办
<9-21,Leonard>What do you want me to do?

371
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,860
<9-22,Penny>去追他吧  带他回来
<9-22,Penny>G-get him; bring him back.

372
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,720
<9-23,Leonard>你确定
<9-23,Leonard>Are you sure?

373
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,970
<9-24,Penny>-对  -好吧
<9-24,Penny>- Yeah. - Okay.

374
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,100
<9-25,Leonard>霍华德  回来吧
<9-25,Leonard>Howard come back.

375
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,520
<9-26,Howard>你们还真让我担心了那么一会儿
<9-26,Howard>Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.

376
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,700
<9-26,Howard>不对  不对
<9-26,Howard>No, no, no, no!

377
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,300
<10-1,Raj>据我们对本次对撞的预测  这个比率远远过低了
<10-1,Raj>That rate is much too low from what we'd expect from this collision.

378
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,550
<10-1,Raj>你到底明不明白
<10-1,Raj>Do you understand

379
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,340
<10-1,Raj>我们在讨论的是  暗物质在外层空间的对撞
<10-1,Raj>We're talking about Dark Matter colliding in outer space?

380
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,750
<10-2,Sheldon>我当然明白
<10-2,Sheldon>Of course I understand.

381
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,120
<10-2,Sheldon>你算哪根葱  来跟我讨论外层空间
<10-2,Sheldon>And who are you to tell me about outer space?

382
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,340
<10-3,Raj>我是天体物理学家
<10-3,Raj>I'm the astrophysicist.

383
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,840
<10-3,Raj>天体  就意味着外太空
<10-3,Raj>"astro" means "space"

384
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,030
<10-4,Sheldon>天体是指星星
<10-4,Sheldon>"astro" means "star"

385
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,050
<10-5,Raj>好吧  这么跟你说吧
<10-5,Raj>Okay, well, let me just tell you,

386
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,380
<10-5,Raj>如果这会儿是用我的母语在跟你争论
<10-5,Raj>If we having this argument in my native language

387
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,630
<10-5,Raj>我早就把你杀得片甲不留
<10-5,Raj>I'd be kicking your butt.

388
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,120
<10-6,Sheldon>英语本来就是你的母语
<10-6,Sheldon>English is your native language.

389
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,640
<10-7,Raj>好吧  这个让你说对了  但这边你确实错了
<10-7,Raj>Okay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!

390
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,860
<10-8,Sheldon>错误和幻想还是有微妙区别的
<10-8,Sheldon>There is a fine line between wrong and visionary.

391
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,360
<10-8,Sheldon>不幸的是  想看我出错  除非你做梦
<10-8,Sheldon>Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.

392
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,850
<10-9,Raj>我的天  你还真以为蹦到你脑子里的
<10-9,Raj>My god, you think that every thought

393
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,720
<10-9,Raj>每一个想法  一定都是真金不怕火炼的
<10-9,Raj>That comes out of your head is pure gold.

394
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,870
<10-9,Raj>我告诉你
<10-9,Raj>Well, let me tell you something.

395
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,570
<10-9,Raj>你有些想法  它就是一堆粪球
<10-9,Raj>Some of those thoughts are pure caca.

396
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
<10-10,Sheldon>粪球
<10-10,Sheldon>Caca

397
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,910
<10-11,Raj>就是一坨屎
<10-11,Raj>It means "doo-doo."

398
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,240
<10-11,Raj>够了
<10-11,Raj>All right!

399
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,630
<10-12,Sheldon>首先  库萨帕里博士
<10-12,Sheldon>First of all, Dr. Koothrappali,

400
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,830
<10-12,Sheldon>我当初提议你跟我共事的时候...
<10-12,Sheldon>When I first proposed that you work with me..

401
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,730
<10-13,Raj>这么说我是跟你共事咯
<10-13,Raj>Aha! So I am working with you.

402
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,190
<10-14,Sheldon>在此语境下  "跟我共事"就是指"为我做事"
<10-14,Sheldon>In this context, "with me" means for me."

403
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,220
<10-15,Raj>好吧  在此语境下...
<10-15,Raj>Ah, well, in this context...

404
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,840
<10-16,Sheldon>你说我错了  证明给我看
<10-16,Sheldon>If I'm wrong, prove it.

405
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,340
<10-16,Sheldon>好吧
<10-16,Sheldon>Okay.

406
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,880
<10-17,Raj>这里我们推导出了暗物质粒子的质量
<10-17,Raj>Here's where we derive the mass of the Dark Matter particle.

407
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,060
<10-18,Sheldon>不 不
<10-18,Sheldon>No, no, no.

408
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,710
<10-18,Sheldon>你对它原子量的表述是错误的
<10-18,Sheldon>You've misstated the atomic weight of the target.

409
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,400
<10-20,Sheldon>-让我说完  -你这是在毁了我的研究
<10-20,Sheldon>- Let me finish. - You're defacing my work.

410
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,350
<10-21,Raj>不对  我是在修正你的研究
<10-21,Raj>I'm not defacing it, I'm fixing it.

411
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,100
<10-22,Sheldon>-把白板擦给我  -不要
<10-22,Sheldon>- Give me the eraser. - No.

412
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,520
<10-24,Sheldon>我说了  把白板擦给我
<10-24,Sheldon>I said give it to me.

413
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,720
<10-25,Raj>有本事就来拿
<10-25,Raj>Come and get it.

414
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,360
<10-25,Raj>好吧
<10-25,Raj>Fine.

415
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,610
<10-26,Sheldon>上帝啊
<10-26,Sheldon>Oh, lord.

416
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,330
<10-26,Sheldon>库萨帕里博士
<10-26,Sheldon>Dr. Koothrappali,

417
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,920
<10-26,Sheldon>我以你上级的身份  禁止你在我的白板上写字
<10-26,Sheldon>As your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!

418
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,420
<10-27,Raj>你才不是我的上级
<10-27,Raj>You are not my superior.

419
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,760
<10-28,Sheldon>从各方面看  我都占优势
<10-28,Sheldon>I am in every way.

420
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,790
<10-29,Raj>是吗
<10-29,Raj>Oh, yeah?

421
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,130
<10-29,Raj>这个你能做到吗
<10-29,Raj>Can you do this?

422
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,130
<10-29,Raj>很高兴与您共事
<10-29,Raj>Nice working with you.

423
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,220
<10-29,Raj>抱歉说错了  是为您做事
<10-29,Raj>I'm sorry-- for you.

424
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,850
<11-1,Sheldon>拉杰
<11-1,Sheldon>Raj...

425
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,680
<11-1,Sheldon>拉杰  拉杰
<11-1,Sheldon>Raj... Raj...

426
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,450
<11-2,Raj>我很忙
<11-2,Raj>I'm busy.

427
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,720
<11-3,Sheldon>忙什么
<11-3,Sheldon>Doing what?

428
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,340
<11-3,Sheldon>好吧  你说得很清楚了
<11-3,Sheldon>All right, you've made your point.

429
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,440
<11-4,Raj>你来干什么  谢尔顿
<11-4,Raj>What do you want, Sheldon?

430
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,860
<11-5,Sheldon>我仔细看了板上的内容
<11-5,Sheldon>I looked over the board

431
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,850
<11-5,Sheldon>结果证明  你是对的
<11-5,Sheldon>And it turns out you were right.

432
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,620
<11-6,Raj>-这么说  你错了  -我可没这么说
<11-6,Raj>- So you were wrong. - I didn't say that.

433
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,870
<11-8,Raj>这是唯一合乎逻辑的推理
<11-8,Raj>That's the only logical inference.

434
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,770
<11-9,Sheldon>尽管如此  反正我没说过
<11-9,Sheldon>Nevertheless, I didn't say it.

435
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,770
<11-9,Sheldon>总之  我想请你回来帮我做事
<11-9,Sheldon>Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.

436
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,890
<11-10,Raj>是帮你做事还是跟你共事
<11-10,Raj>For you or with you?

437
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,230
<11-11,Sheldon>在此语境下  "帮我做事"也指"跟我共事"
<11-11,Sheldon>In this coext "for me" could mean "with me."

438
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,530
<11-12,Raj>好吧  但我有几个条件
<11-12,Raj>All right, but I have some conditions.

439
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,220
<11-13,Sheldon>-我一概拒绝  -我接受这份工作
<11-13,Sheldon>- I reject them all. - I'll take the job.

440
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,130
<11-14,Raj>周一见
<11-14,Raj>See you Monday.

441
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,520
<11-15,Sheldon>等等  你得载我回家
<11-15,Sheldon>Wait, you have to drive me home.

442
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,970
<11-16,Raj>-你怎么来的  -走路来的
<11-16,Raj>- How did you get here? - I walked.

443
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,970
<11-18,Raj>-那就再走回去  -不行
<11-18,Raj>- So walk home. - I can't.

444
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,490
<11-19,Sheldon>外面有条大狗...
<11-19,Sheldon>There's a big dog outside...

445
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,580
<11-19,Sheldon>回家路上  我们可以开始想想
<11-19,Sheldon>On the way home, we can start thinking

446
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,870
<11-19,Sheldon>为500GeV的粒子  优化探测器的办法
<11-19,Sheldon>About methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GeV particles

447
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,570
<11-19,Sheldon>好吧
<11-19,Sheldon>All right.
