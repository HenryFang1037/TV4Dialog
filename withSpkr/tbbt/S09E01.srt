20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,410
<1-1,Penny>你觉得哪个婚礼套餐好
<1-1,Penny>So, what package are you thinking?

<1-2,Leonard>而且还能在网上直播我们的婚礼
<1-2,Leonard>Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,060
<1-3,Penny>我们直播了干嘛
<1-3,Penny>Why would we want that?

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,570
<1-4,Leonard>因为世上还有许多漂亮的金发妹
<1-4,Leonard>'Cause there's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,740
<1-4,Leonard>不信自己能有幸找到一个四眼短腿科学家
<1-4,Leonard>who don't believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,810
<1-4,Leonard>让她们看到还有希望嘛
<1-4,Leonard>Let's give them hope.

<1-5,Penny>随便  网上直播就直播吧
<1-5,Penny>Whatever. Put us on the Internet.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,510
<1-5,Penny>我从小就"梦想"自己的婚礼有个留言区
<1-5,Penny>I've always wanted a wedding with a comment section.

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,290
<1-6,Leonard>如果你不想  我们可以以后再结
<1-6,Leonard>I-If you're not into this, we can do it another time.

30
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,350
<1-7,Penny>不  不  我想结婚
<1-7,Penny>No. No, I want to.

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,890
<1-7,Penny>这事我们已经拖得太久了
<1-7,Penny>Look, we've put this off long enough.

32
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,360
<1-7,Penny>现在就做吧
<1-7,Penny>Let's do it.

33
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,890
<1-8,Leonard>我们第一次"睡"时  你也说现在就"做"吧
<1-8,Leonard>That's exactly what you said the first time we slept together.

34
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,920
<1-8,Leonard>抱歉
<1-8,Leonard>Oh, excuse me.

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,440

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,550
<1-9,Sheldon>莱纳德  你结完婚了吗
<1-9,Sheldon>Leonard, have you gotten married yet?

37
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,490
<1-10,Leonard>还没  怎么了
<1-10,Leonard>No. Why?

38
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,380
<1-11,Sheldon>-那就好  别结  -为什么不行
<1-11,Sheldon>- Good. Don't do it! - Why not?

39
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,680
<1-13,Sheldon>我刚发现了重要的新资讯
<1-13,Sheldon>Some important new information has come to light.

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,700
<1-13,Sheldon>女人最坏了
<1-13,Sheldon>Women are the worst.

41
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,450
<1-13,Sheldon>我本以为就像被纸割到手  但我错了
<1-13,Sheldon>I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong.

42
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,120
<1-13,Sheldon>从没有一张纸比女人割我还深
<1-13,Sheldon>No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.

43
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,530
<1-14,Leonard>又怎么啦
<1-14,Leonard>What happened now?

44
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,720
<1-15,Sheldon>艾米跟我分手了
<1-15,Sheldon>Amy has ended our relationship.

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,230
<1-16,Leonard>不是吧  真的吗
<1-16,Leonard>Oh, no. Seriously?

46
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,150
<1-17,Penny>发生什么事了
<1-17,Penny>What's going on?

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,430
<1-18,Leonard>艾米甩了谢尔顿
<1-18,Leonard>Amy broke up with Sheldon.

48

49
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,230
<1-20,Sheldon>佩妮泪崩了吗
<1-20,Sheldon>Is Penny crying?

50
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,850
<1-21,Leonard>没有
<1-21,Leonard>No.

51
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,880
<1-22,Sheldon>她当然不会哭啦
<1-22,Sheldon>No, of course not.

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,740
<1-22,Sheldon>女人巴不得看我们受折磨
<1-22,Sheldon>They thrive on our suffering.

53
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,820
<1-23,Leonard>兄弟  我很遗憾
<1-23,Leonard>Buddy, I-I'm so sorry.

54
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,170
<1-23,Leonard>我能为你做点什么吗
<1-23,Leonard>Is there anything I can do?

55
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,820
<1-24,Sheldon>能  以后我再说我要跟女生交往
<1-24,Sheldon>Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again,

56
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,950
<1-24,Sheldon>你就对我翻白眼
<1-24,Sheldon>roll your eyes at me

57
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,210
<1-24,Sheldon>就像我听到你说蠢话时的那样
<1-24,Sheldon>like I do to you when you say dumb things.

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,480
<1-25,Leonard>行  谢尔顿
<1-25,Leonard>Sheldon, uh, o-okay,

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,090
<1-25,Leonard>虽然艾米让你难过了
<1-25,Leonard>just because you're going through this with Amy

60
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,320
<1-25,Leonard>但并不代表所有女人都很坏
<1-25,Leonard>doesn't mean that all women are bad.

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,080
<1-26,Sheldon>呵呵
<1-26,Sheldon>Whatever.

62
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,820
<1-27,Penny (on phone)>我刚听说你跟谢尔顿的事  你还好吗
<1-27,Penny (on phone)>Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,880
<1-28,Amy>不太好

64
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,000
<1-28,Amy>你能来陪我吗
<1-28,Amy>Can you come over?

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,060
<1-29,Penny>我现在在赌城
<1-29,Penny>Uh, actually I'm in Vegas.

66
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,160
<1-29,Penny>我跟莱纳德准备要结婚了
<1-29,Penny>Leonard and I are about to get married.

67
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,470
<1-30,Amy>等等
<1-30,Amy>Hold on.

68
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,930
<1-30,Amy>你们结婚居然没邀请我
<1-30,Amy>You're getting married and you didn't invite me?

69
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,770
<1-31,Penny>我们只是一时心血来潮
<1-31,Penny>Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.

<1-32,Amy>希望我能从这里接到你的捧花啊
<1-32,Amy>Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.

71
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,680
<1-33,Penny>艾米  别这样嘛
<1-33,Penny>Amy, don't be like that.

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,330
<1-34,Sheldon>为什么我听到有人说艾米的名字
<1-34,Sheldon>Why did I just hear Amy's name?

73
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,490
<1-35,Leonard>佩妮在跟她通电话
<1-35,Leonard>Penny's on the phone with her.

00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,910
<1-36,Sheldon>她有提到我吗
<1-36,Sheldon>Did she say anything about me?

75
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,390
<1-36,Sheldon>算了  我才不在乎
<1-36,Sheldon>Never mind. I don't care.

<1-36,Sheldon>如果你在乎  你可以问清楚告诉我
<1-36,Sheldon>Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me.

77
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,590
<1-36,Sheldon>但你发现我压根不在乎时  别太惊讶哦
<1-36,Sheldon>Just don't be shocked when you find out that I don't care.

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,790
<1-37,Penny>你别激动好吗

<1-40,Sheldon>艾米心情不好是因为我吗
<1-40,Sheldon>Amy's upset? Is it about me?

85
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,620
<1-41,Leonard>不是  我想是因为我们私奔来结婚
<1-41,Leonard>No, I think it's because we're eloping.

86
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,450
<1-42,Sheldon>你的婚礼让她难受了吗
<1-42,Sheldon>Your marriage is causing her pain?

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,210
<2-11,Sheldon>一逮到机会
<2-11,Sheldon>Just couldn't wait for that first notch

115
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,270
<2-11,Sheldon>就等不及要"开荤"了是吧
<2-11,Sheldon>on your bedpost, could you?

116
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,000
<2-12,Amy>如果你一定要问

118
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,710
<2-12,Amy>一起看婚礼直播
<2-12,Amy>to watch the wedding.

119
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,000
<2-13,Sheldon>你要带哪个男人去
<2-13,Sheldon>And who's this guy you're taking?

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,130
<2-14,Amy>没有要带男人
<2-14,Amy>There's no guy!

121
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,360
<2-15,Sheldon>你要形单影只的去参加婚礼吗
<2-15,Sheldon>Oh, you're going to a wedding alone?

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,040
<2-15,Sheldon>好惨呐
<2-15,Sheldon>That's sad.

123
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,470
<2-16,Amy>我才不会形单影只
<2-16,Amy>I'm not gonna be alone.

124
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,070
<2-16,Amy>我的小伙伴们也会在

127
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,540
<2-17,Sheldon>而且为什么没人邀请我啊
<2-17,Sheldon>And why wasn't I invited to this?

128
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,540
<2-18,Amy>或许是因为我们两个同时在场
<2-18,Amy>Maybe because the two of us being there

129
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,030
<2-18,Amy>会让他们觉得很尴尬吧
<2-18,Amy>would make them feel awkward.

130
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,870
<2-19,Sheldon>我们让所有人感到尴尬
<2-19,Sheldon>We make everyone feel awkward.

131
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,360
<2-19,Sheldon>这是我们的招牌啊
<2-19,Sheldon>That's our thing!

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,550
<3-1,Leonard>前面的人可能耽误了
<3-1,Leonard>They're running a little behind.

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,050
<3-1,Leonard>-应该很快就到我们了  -好的
<3-1,Leonard>- Should be pretty soon. - Okay.

134
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,850
<3-3,Leonard>如果你饿了  隔壁那家脱衣舞厅
<3-3,Leonard>Hey, if you're hungry, there's a breakfast buffet

135
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,800
<3-3,Leonard>有自助早餐

136
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,950
<3-4,Penny>多谢  但我不喜欢煎蛋上有闪粉
<3-4,Penny>Thanks, but I don't like glitter on my scrambled eggs.

138
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,190
<3-5,Leonard>早餐应该不是脱衣舞娘做的吧  但没关系
<3-5,Leonard>I don't think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay.

139
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,180
<3-5,Leonard>虽然这跟我想象中的也不一样
<3-5,Leonard>Look, it-it's not how I pictured it either,

140
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,890
<3-5,Leonard>但我很高兴我们要结婚了

<3-7,Leonard>-你确定吗  -确定
<3-7,Leonard>- You sure? - Yes.

143
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,010
<3-9,Leonard>你保证车里的谈话不会影响到你吗
<3-9,Leonard>And you promise you're okay with everything from the car?

144
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,280
<3-10,Penny>老天  你能不能别一个劲地提这茬
<3-10,Penny>Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?

145
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,970
<3-10,Penny>你说得对  对不起
<3-10,Penny>You're right. I'm sorry.

<3-11,Leonard>We have the rest of our lives

147
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,900
<3-11,Leonard>可以慢慢翻旧账  再大吵一架
<3-11,Leonard>to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it.

148
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,910
<3-11,Leonard>你觉得怎么样
<3-11,Leonard>So what do you think?

149
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,920
<3-11,Leonard>我们要不要去隔壁吃一口
<3-11,Leonard>Should we run next door and grab a bite?

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,260
<3-12,Penny>万一叫到我们怎么办
<3-12,Penny>What if they call our names?

151
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,480
<3-13,Leonard>别担心  他们给了我震动叫号器
<3-13,Leonard>Oh, don't worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,270
<3-14,Penny>哇  真是犹如"童话"一般
<3-14,Penny>Oh, and the fairy tale continues.

153
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,110
<4-1,Amy>感谢你们收留我
<4-1,Amy>Thank you for doing this.

154
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,330
<4-2,Bernadette>别客气
<4-2,Bernadette>Our pleasure.

155
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,690
<4-2,Bernadette>你心情还好吗
<4-2,Bernadette>You feeling okay?

156
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,750
<4-3,Amy>我们在一起这么久
<4-3,Amy>We were together for so long,

157
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,070
<4-3,Amy>老实说  我都不知道现在是什么心情
<4-3,Amy>I honestly don't know what I'm feeling.

158
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,510
<4-4,Howard>可以理解
<4-4,Howard>Well, that's understandable.

159
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,370
<4-4,Howard>因为你忘了这种心情叫"快乐"
<4-4,Howard>You forgot. It's called "happy."

160
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,210
<4-5,Bernadette>霍华德
<4-5,Bernadette>Howard.

161
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,700
<4-6,Howard>我又没说什么不好的话
<4-6,Howard>I'm not saying anything bad.

162
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,240
<4-6,Howard>她爱上了囚禁自己的变态
<4-6,Howard>Just that she was in love with her captor

163
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,410
<4-6,Howard>结果福至心灵逃出了他阴暗又疯狂的地牢
<4-6,Howard>and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.

164
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,690
<4-7,Stuart>我知道你现在的感受
<4-7,Stuart>I know what you're going through.

165
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,340
<4-7,Stuart>我前一次分手也非常不好受
<4-7,Stuart>My-my last breakup was pretty tough.

166
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,220
<4-8,Amy>是吗  那女孩叫什么
<4-8,Amy>Oh. What was her name?

167
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,330
<4-9,Stuart>拜托  这可是真事
<4-9,Stuart>Hey, it's a true story.

168
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,570
<4-9,Stuart>不需要这么逼问我细节吧
<4-9,Stuart>I don't need the third degree.

169
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,580
<4-10,Bernadette>要人命啊  谢尔顿  你在干嘛
<4-10,Bernadette>For God's sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?

170
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,060
<4-11,Sheldon>我不想进去
<4-11,Sheldon>I didn't want to come in.

171
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,180
<4-11,Sheldon>有人说我会让大家觉得尴尬
<4-11,Sheldon>I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable.

172
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,800
<4-11,Sheldon>所以我就在外面待着
<4-11,Sheldon>So I'll just stay out here

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,710
<4-11,Sheldon>假装我不需要上洗手间
<4-11,Sheldon>and pretend that I don't have to go to the bathroom.

174
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,420
<4-12,Bernadette>霍华德  想想办法
<4-12,Bernadette>Howard, do something.

175
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,900
<4-13,Howard>交给我吧
<4-13,Howard>I'm on it.

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,410
<4-14,Amy>谢尔顿  你来这也不会让事情产生转机
<4-14,Amy>Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.

177
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,780
<4-14,Amy>我明白
<4-14,Amy>I see.

178
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,500
<4-15,Sheldon>所以你们邀请大家  唯独漏了我吗
<4-15,Sheldon>And is that why everybody was invited but me?

179
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,610
<4-16,Amy>他们没有邀请大家不邀请你啊
<4-16,Amy>They didn't invite everybody but you.

180
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,010
<4-16,Amy>伯纳黛特邀请我
<4-16,Amy>Bernadette invited me,

181
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,510
<4-16,Amy>斯尔图特本来就住这里
<4-16,Amy>and Stuart lives here.

182
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,960
<4-17,Raj>谁想吃刚出炉的肉桂卷啊
<4-17,Raj>Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?

183
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,500
<5-1,Official>一听到音乐  你们就可以往前走了
<5-1,Official>So, when you hear the music, that's your cue.

184
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,400
<5-1,Official>有问题吗
<5-1,Official>Any questions?

185
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,410
<5-2,Leonard>我们买的那个套餐
<5-2,Leonard>Oh, the package that we paid for

186
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,040
<5-2,Leonard>写着走道上会铺满玫瑰花瓣
<5-2,Leonard>said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.

187
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,290
<5-3,Official>玫瑰花瓣呢
<5-3,Official>Where are the rose petals?!

188

<5-5,Female Voice>我们可以用厕所里的干花瓣
<5-5,Female Voice>We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!

191
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,290
<5-6,Penny>真的不需要了
<5-6,Penny>Really, we're good.

192

<5-14,Female Voice>干花瓣还要不要了
<5-14,Female Voice>Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?!

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,670
<5-15,Penny>-不要了  -谢谢
<5-15,Penny>- No, thank you! - We're good!

200
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,830
<6-1,Sheldon>拉杰  你脑中肯定在想
<6-1,Sheldon>Raj, you're probably wondering

201
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,010
<6-1,Sheldon>为什么我和艾米不秀恩爱了
<6-1,Sheldon>why Amy and I aren't showing any affection to one another.

202
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,680
<6-2,Raj>这事都没挤进我脑海中的前十
<6-2,Raj>Didn't even crack the top ten.

203
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,550
<6-3,Sheldon>你应该要知道她刚刚跟我分手了
<6-3,Sheldon>Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.

204
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,280
<6-4,Amy>我说我需要时间思考
<6-4,Amy>I said I needed time to think.

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,940
<6-5,Raj>我相信你们俩会想出解决办法
<6-5,Raj>I'm sure you guys will figure something out.

206
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,380
<6-6,Sheldon>听见了没  拉杰都悲痛欲绝了
<6-6,Sheldon>You hear that? Raj is devastated.

207
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,460
<6-7,Bernadette>谢尔顿  别吵  婚礼开始了
<6-7,Bernadette>Sheldon, shh. The wedding's starting.

208
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,810
<6-8,Sheldon>我知道怎么回事了
<6-8,Sheldon>I see what's happening.

209
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,050
<6-8,Sheldon>大伙儿开始分边站了
<6-8,Sheldon>Sides are forming.

210
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,440
<6-8,Sheldon>如果伯纳黛特支持艾米  那我选霍华德好了
<6-8,Sheldon>Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team, I pick Howard.

211
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,320
<6-9,Howard>我不偏袒任何一方
<6-9,Howard>I'm not taking sides.

212
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,270
<6-10,Sheldon>好吧  那我只能选拉杰了
<6-10,Sheldon>Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.

213
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,440
<6-11,Raj>你不是吧
<6-11,Raj>Really?

214
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,070
<6-12,Stuart>至少你被选上了
<6-12,Stuart>At least you got picked.

215
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,700
<7-1,Official>在我继续仪式前
<7-1,Official>Before I go any further,

216
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,930
<7-1,Official>我想问你们俩有准备誓词吗
<7-1,Official>have either of you prepared your own vows?

217
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,500
<7-2,Leonard>-有  -没有

<7-3,Penny>你居然写了誓词
<7-3,Penny>You wrote vows?

219
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,150
<7-4,Leonard>是的
<7-4,Leonard>Yeah.

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,910
<7-5,Penny>我一个字都没写
<7-5,Penny>Well, I don't have any.

221
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,020
<7-5,Penny>你让我好没面子啊
<7-5,Penny>You're kind of making me look bad.

222
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,090
<7-6,Leonard>没事  我也不一定非要念
<7-6,Leonard>It's okay. I-I don't have to say them.

223
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,910
<7-7,Penny>不不不  念吧
<7-7,Penny>No, no, no, go ahead.

228
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,170
<7-8,Leonard>我常想那些原子
<7-8,Leonard>I like to think those atoms traveled

229
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,880
<7-8,Leonard>用140亿年穿越时间和空间来创造我们
<7-8,Leonard>14 billion years through time and space to create us,

241
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,420
<7-12,Official>这不是《玩具总动员》的歌吗
<7-12,Official>Is that the song from Toy Story?

242

<7-13,Penny>他可喜欢那部电影了

<8-4,Sheldon>艾米  我不明白  我们到底分手了没
<8-4,Sheldon>Amy, I don't understand, are we broken up or not?

248
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,380
<8-4,Sheldon>你好像一直作不了决定啊
<8-4,Sheldon>It's like you can't make up your mind.

249
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,150
<8-5,Amy>那是因为你完全不给我思考的空间
<8-5,Amy>It's because you're not giving me any space to think.

250
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,510
<8-6,Sheldon>是吗  那你最好赶紧想
<8-6,Sheldon>Well, you should think fast,

251
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,070
<8-6,Sheldon>因为男人一辈子都能传宗接代
<8-6,Sheldon>because men can sire offspring their entire lives,

252
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,110
<8-6,Sheldon>你的卵子可是会过期作废哦
<8-6,Sheldon>but those eggs you're toting around have a sell-by date.

253
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,530
<8-7,Amy>谢尔顿  你这临门一脚来得正是时候
<8-7,Amy>You know what, Sheldon, you've made this really easy.

254
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,150
<8-7,Amy>你是个幼稚透顶  自私自利的人
<8-7,Amy>You're immature, you're selfish,

255
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,110
<8-7,Amy>你还当面羞辱我
<8-7,Amy>you just insulted me to my face.

256
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,410
<8-7,Amy>我不用再想了  咱俩玩完了
<8-7,Amy>I don't need any more time to think. We're broken up.

257
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,690
<8-8,Bernadette>艾米

<9-1,Leonard>I believe I'm supposed to carry you across the threshold.

267
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,060
<9-2,Penny>你行吗
<9-2,Penny>Can you?

268
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,350
<9-3,Leonard>你以为谢尔顿看电视睡着
<9-3,Leonard>Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed

269
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,020
<9-3,Leonard>都是哪位壮士抱他回房间的啊
<9-3,Leonard>when he falls asleep in front of the TV?

270
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,770
<9-4,Penny>好吧  来吧
<9-4,Penny>Okay, let's do it.

271
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,300
<9-4,Penny>-你能做到吗  -没问题
<9-4,Penny>- You gonna make it? - I'm okay!

272
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,530
<9-6,Penny>顺利完成
<9-6,Penny>Nicely done!

273
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,810
<9-6,Penny>谢谢你
<9-6,Penny>Thank you.

274
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,210
<9-7,Leonard>总算有一位"霍夫斯塔德夫人"
<9-7,Leonard>Finally, there's a Mrs. Hofstadter

275
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,130
<9-7,Leonard>没对我失望了
<9-7,Leonard>who isn't disappointed in me.

276
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,770
<9-8,Penny>说这话还为时尚早呢
<9-8,Penny>Well, the night is still young.

277
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,780
<9-9,Leonard>你没事吧
<9-9,Leonard>Everything all right?

278
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,860
<9-10,Penny>没事
<9-10,Penny>Yeah. I guess.

279
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,120
<9-11,Leonard>告诉我嘛
<9-11,Leonard>Just tell me.

280
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,360
<9-12,Penny>我们接吻时
<9-12,Penny>It's just, when we were kissing,

281
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,650
<9-12,Penny>我总是忍不住去想你和其他女孩的画面
<9-12,Penny>I couldn't help but picture you with that other girl.

282
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,690
<9-12,Penny>不会吧
<9-12,Penny>Oh, no.

283
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,080
<9-13,Leonard>别这样
<9-13,Leonard>No, come on.

284
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,970
<9-13,Leonard>你可是我的好朋友
<9-13,Leonard>I have a friend in you.

285
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,510
<9-13,Leonard>你自己说的
<9-13,Leonard>You said so.

286
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,340
<9-14,Penny>你说得对  忘掉这事吧
<9-14,Penny>You're right. Just forget it.

287
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,040
<9-14,Penny>好的
<9-14,Penny>Yeah.

288
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,170
<9-15,Leonard>好了  听我说
<9-15,Leonard>Okay, listen. Uh...

289
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,620
<9-15,Leonard>如果你以为那是很香艳的画面
<9-15,Leonard>If you're imagining that it was sexy,

290
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,760
<9-15,Leonard>其实并没有
<9-15,Leonard>it wasn't.

291
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,550
<9-15,Leonard>我们都喝挂了  她一股子烟灰缸味
<9-15,Leonard>We-we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray.

292
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,800
<9-15,Leonard>船身摇晃不定  我还撞碎了她的牙齿
<9-15,Leonard>The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.

293
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,390
<9-16,Penny>你觉得内疚吗
<9-16,Penny>Did you feel guilty?

294
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,750
<9-17,Leonard>不  她有牙医保险
<9-17,Leonard>No, she had dental insurance.

295
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,470
<9-18,Penny>你和她接吻后觉得内疚吗
<9-18,Penny>Did you feel guilty after kissing her?

296
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,380
<9-19,Leonard>当然  我刚亲完就后悔了
<9-19,Leonard>Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened.

297
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,900
<9-19,Leonard>每次看到她都有深深的负罪感
<9-19,Leonard>I feel guilty every time I see her.

298
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,420
<9-20,Penny>你说每次看到她是什么意思
<9-20,Penny>What do you mean, every time you see her?

299
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,170
<9-21,Leonard>我...是什么意思呢
<9-21,Leonard>What... do I mean?

300
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,080
<9-21,Leonard>老天  这个问题可真难
<9-21,Leonard>Boy, that's a toughie.

301
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,090
<9-22,Penny>你现在还会见她吗
<9-22,Penny>You still see her?

302
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,540
<9-23,Leonard>不  不是约她见面的那种
<9-23,Leonard>Well, no, not socially.

303
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,860
<9-23,Leonard>只是工作时会遇到
<9-23,Leonard>But, you know, just at work.

304
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,660
<9-24,Penny>你还和她一起工作吗
<9-24,Penny>You work with her?!

305
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,280
<9-24,Penny>你怎么不告诉我这件事
<9-24,Penny>How could you not tell me that?!

306
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,070
<9-25,Leonard>我在车里就想告诉你  可你要我闭嘴
<9-25,Leonard>I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking!

307
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,700
<9-26,Penny>好呀  所以现在是我错了吗
<9-26,Penny>Oh, okay. So you're saying this is my fault?

308
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,340
<9-26,Penny>不  当然不是
<9-26,Penny>No, of course not.

309
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,270
<9-27,Leonard>好了  我说
<9-27,Leonard>Okay, l-look,

310
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,470
<9-27,Leonard>我们不要吵了
<9-27,Leonard>instead of fighting,

311
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,130
<9-27,Leonard>不如把灯关掉
<9-27,Leonard>why don't we dim the lights,

312
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,970
<9-27,Leonard>脱光光  造宝宝好不好
<9-27,Leonard>um, get naked and make a baby?

313
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,400
<9-27,Leonard>我是在努力调节气氛
<9-27,Leonard>I was trying to lighten the mood.

314
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,950
<9-27,Leonard>这事可不容易  不信你试试
<9-27,Leonard>It's not easy. You try it.

315
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,740
<10-1,Sheldon (on phone)>妈妈  你好
<10-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Hello, Mother.

316
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,250
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>谢利  宝贝你还好吗
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>Shelly! How's my baby doing?

317
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,930
<10-3,Sheldon>我想让你知道
<10-3,Sheldon>I just wanted to let you know

318
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,880
<10-3,Sheldon>你可以把艾米从你的夜祷名单上去掉了
<10-3,Sheldon>that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers.

319
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,320
<10-3,Sheldon>除非你愿意祈祷
<10-3,Sheldon>Unless you're open to praying for

320
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,580
<10-3,Sheldon>一个大蜂巢掉在她头上
<10-3,Sheldon>a beehive to fall on her head.

321
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,070
<10-4,Mrs Cooper>这是怎么了
<10-4,Mrs Cooper>Oh, what's going on?

322
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,380
<10-5,Sheldon>她和我分手了
<10-5,Sheldon>She broke up with me.

323
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,930
<10-6,Mrs Cooper>谢利
<10-6,Mrs Cooper>Oh, Shelly.

324
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,290
<10-6,Mrs Cooper>不  我没事
<10-6,Mrs Cooper>No, I'll be okay.

325
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,970
<10-7,Sheldon>但我想把
<10-7,Sheldon>But I think that I'd like

326
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,710
<10-7,Sheldon>戒指寄还给你
<10-7,Sheldon>to send the ring back to you.

327
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,420
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>先别这么着急
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>Well, let's not be hasty.

328
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,040
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>你确定真的结束了吗
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>Are you sure it's over for good?

329
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,780
<10-9,Sheldon>反正我是结束了  我受够女人了
<10-9,Sheldon>It's over for me. I'm done with women.

330
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,550
<10-9,Sheldon>就像我再也不吃跳跳糖一样
<10-9,Sheldon>Like when I swore off Pop Rocks.

331
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,930
<10-9,Sheldon>他们都故意伤害我
<10-9,Sheldon>They both hurt you on purpose.

332
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,070
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>想跟妈妈倾诉一下吗
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>You want to tell me what happened?

333
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,020
<10-11,Sheldon>你会说一切都是上帝安排好的吗
<10-11,Sheldon>Are you going to say it's all part of God's plan?

334
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,010
<10-12,Mrs Cooper>很有可能
<10-12,Mrs Cooper>Good chance.

335
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,730
<10-13,Sheldon>谢谢  那还是算了
<10-13,Sheldon>Then no, thank you.

336
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,460
<10-14,Mrs Cooper>宝贝  先别把戒指寄回来
<10-14,Mrs Cooper>Well, honey, don't send it back yet.

337
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,350
<10-14,Mrs Cooper>你姐姐结婚了  我祖母的戒指
<10-14,Mrs Cooper>Your sister's married, and I'm not letting your brother

338
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,910
<10-14,Mrs Cooper>我不想送给你哥哥在泡的那个小荡妇
<10-14,Mrs Cooper>give my grandmother's ring to that whore he's dating.

339
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,810
<10-15,Sheldon>抹大拉的玛利亚不也是个妓女吗
<10-15,Sheldon>Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?

340
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,510
<10-16,Mrs Cooper>如果你那白痴哥哥可以拯救人间苍生
<10-16,Mrs Cooper>When your idiot brother redeems mankind,

341
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,790
<10-16,Mrs Cooper>那他想和谁约会都没问题
<10-16,Mrs Cooper>he can date whoever he wants.

342
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,300
<11-1,Bernadette>我知道你现在很难过  但会过去的
<11-1,Bernadette>I know it hurts now, but it's gonna get better.

343
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,020
<11-2,Amy>是的
<11-2,Amy>Yeah.

344
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,760
<11-3,Howard>一切都会好起来
<11-3,Howard>Everything's gonna be okay.

345
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,390
<11-4,Stuart>你集无数优点于一身
<11-4,Stuart>You've got so much to offer.

346
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,840
<11-5,Amy>谢谢你
<11-5,Amy>Thank you.

347
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,100
<11-6,Stuart>能和你在一起是每个男人的荣幸
<11-6,Stuart>Any man would be lucky to have you.

348
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,830
<11-7,Bernadette>没错
<11-7,Bernadette>That's true.

349
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,820
<11-8,Amy>我只希望我做了正确的选择
<11-8,Amy>I just hope I did the right thing.

350
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,540
<11-9,Stuart>我肯定你做得对
<11-9,Stuart>I'm sure you did.

351
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,740
<11-9,Stuart>或许这就是你的问题  永远做正确的选择
<11-9,Stuart>Maybe that's the problem-- you always do the right thing.

352
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,150
<11-9,Stuart>或许是时候"犯个错误"了
<11-9,Stuart>Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing.

353
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,760
<11-10,Amy>比如做你现在这样的错事吗
<11-10,Amy>Like you're doing right now?

354
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,810
<11-11,Stuart>没错
<11-11,Stuart>Exactly.

355
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,290
<12-1,Leonard>我一次又一次问你介不介意
<12-1,Leonard>I asked you over and over if you were okay.

356
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,420
<12-1,Leonard>如果你介意  为什么还要完婚呢
<12-1,Leonard>Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?

357
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,050
<12-2,Penny>我本来以为我不介意  谁知道原来不行
<12-2,Penny>I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.

358
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,020
<12-3,Leonard>好吧  我或许不是百分百诚实
<12-3,Leonard>Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful,

359
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,040
<12-3,Leonard>但你体重也不是多轻好吗
<12-3,Leonard>but you, you are not easy to lift!

360
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,680
<12-4,Sheldon>婚姻太适合你了
<12-4,Sheldon>Well, marriage must agree with you.

361
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,440
<12-4,Sheldon>你整个人容光焕发啊
<12-4,Sheldon>Well, you are just glowing.

362
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,780
<12-5,Leonard>我才没有容光焕发
<12-5,Leonard>I'm not glowing.

363
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,350
<12-5,Leonard>我是不爽到炸
<12-5,Leonard>I'm upset.

364
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,840
<12-6,Sheldon>随便你什么心情  反正太适合你了
<12-6,Sheldon>Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.

365
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,540
<13-1,Sheldon (outside)>敲  敲  敲  佩妮
<13-1,Sheldon (outside)>Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

366
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,310
<13-1,Sheldon (outside)>敲  敲  敲  佩妮
<13-1,Sheldon (outside)>Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

367
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,210
<13-1,Sheldon (outside)>敲  敲  敲  佩妮
<13-1,Sheldon (outside)>Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

368
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,330
<13-2,Penny>这是什么
<13-2,Penny>What's this?

369
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,860
<13-3,Sheldon>莱纳德都跟我说了
<13-3,Sheldon>Leonard told me what happened,

370
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,740
<13-3,Sheldon>所以我自发为你做了热饮
<13-3,Sheldon>so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.

371
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,410
<13-4,Penny>你真是太贴心了
<13-4,Penny>Oh. That's so sweet of you.

372
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,850
<13-4,Penny>我知道
<13-4,Penny>Yeah. I know.

373
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,690
<13-5,Sheldon>事实证明  这年头
<13-5,Sheldon>Turns out, being sweet

374
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,950
<13-5,Sheldon>贴心并不能留住姑娘
<13-5,Sheldon>isn't enough to keep a girl these days.

375
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,570
<13-5,Sheldon>都怪麦当娜
<13-5,Sheldon>I blame Madonna.

376
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,790
<13-6,Penny>很遗憾你和艾米分手了
<13-6,Penny>I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.

377
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,550
<13-7,Sheldon>我也很遗憾莱纳德那样对你
<13-7,Sheldon>Well, I'm sorry about Leonard.

378
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,610
<13-7,Sheldon>都怪我没教好他
<13-7,Sheldon>Thought I raised him better than that.

379
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,510
<13-8,Penny>发生那种事已经够糟心了
<13-8,Penny>You know, it's bad enough what happened,

380
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,830
<13-8,Penny>但更糟心的是他还试图隐瞒
<13-8,Penny>but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her

381
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,890
<13-8,Penny>他整天能在大学里见到她
<13-8,Penny>all the time at the university.

382
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,080
<13-9,Sheldon>是吗  谁啊
<13-9,Sheldon>He does? Who is it?

383
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,330
<13-10,Penny>一个叫曼蒂的女人
<13-10,Penny>Some girl named Mandy.

384
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,330
<13-11,Sheldon>-曼蒂·周吗  -对的
<13-11,Sheldon>- Mandy Chao? - Yeah.

385
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,200
<13-13,Sheldon>你完全不需要担心她
<13-13,Sheldon>Oh, you don't need to worry about her.

386
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,590
<13-13,Sheldon>她美貌与智慧兼具
<13-13,Sheldon>She's brilliant and attractive.

387
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,950
<13-13,Sheldon>她能找到比莱纳德好十万倍的男人
<13-13,Sheldon>She can do way better than Leonard.

388
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,290
<13-14,Penny>太好了
<13-14,Penny>That's great.

389
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,850
<13-15,Sheldon>等等
<13-15,Sheldon>Wait a minute.

390
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,780
<13-15,Sheldon>我知道这话可能有点不现实
<13-15,Sheldon>I know this may sound farfetched,

391
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,520
<13-15,Sheldon>但我现在也单身了
<13-15,Sheldon>but I'm on the market now.

392
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,650
<13-15,Sheldon>如果我跟曼蒂好上了
<13-15,Sheldon>You know, if I dated Mandy,

393
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,510
<13-15,Sheldon>应该能给莱纳德与艾米一个教训
<13-15,Sheldon>that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.

394
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,960
<13-16,Penny>这也太荒谬了
<13-16,Penny>That's ridiculous.

395
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,240
<13-16,Penny>也是
<13-16,Penny>Oh, you're right.

396
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,010
<13-17,Sheldon>我决不会跟一个自尊心低到能跟莱纳德
<13-17,Sheldon>I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low

397
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,750
<13-17,Sheldon>在一起的女人好上
<13-17,Sheldon>she'd be with Leonard.

398
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,790
<13-18,Penny>我就跟莱纳德在一起啊
<13-18,Penny>I'm with Leonard.

399
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,050
<13-19,Sheldon>是啊  一辈子呢
<13-19,Sheldon>Yeah, I know. Forever.

400
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,060
<13-19,Sheldon>谁敢相信我们居然会碰到这样的事
<13-19,Sheldon>Who would have believed these things would happen to us?

401
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,140
<13-19,Sheldon>对吧
<13-19,Sheldon>Right?

402
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,870
<13-20,Penny>我也不敢相信艾米居然真决定狠下心
<13-20,Penny>I can't believe Amy actually went through with it.

403
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,450
<13-20,Penny>等等
<13-20,Penny>Hang on.

404
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,900
<13-21,Sheldon>你之前就知道她会跟我分手吗
<13-21,Sheldon>You knew that she was going to end it with me?

405
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,910
<13-21,Sheldon>你有试图阻止她吗
<13-21,Sheldon>Did you try and stop her?

406
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,030
<13-22,Penny>我让她直面本心
<13-22,Penny>I told her to be true to herself

407
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,480
<13-22,Penny>做让自己开心的选择
<13-22,Penny>and do what makes her happy.

408
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,180
<13-22,Penny>做让自己开心的选择
<13-22,Penny>Do what makes her happy?

409
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,290
<13-23,Sheldon>她有竖琴有车
<13-23,Sheldon>She plays the harp and her car is paid for.

410
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,600
<13-23,Sheldon>这还不够开心吗
<13-23,Sheldon>How much happier can she be?

411
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,350
<13-24,Penny>这不能怪我啊
<13-24,Penny>Okay, look, it's not my fault

412
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,800
<13-24,Penny>她是自己觉得你是差劲的男友
<13-24,Penny>that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.

413
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,880
<13-25,Sheldon>我懂了
<13-25,Sheldon>I see.

414
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,390
<13-25,Sheldon>我先走一步了
<13-25,Sheldon>I think I'll be going.

415
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,200
<13-27,Sheldon>-谢尔顿  -多说无益
<13-27,Sheldon>- Sheldon... - No, no, no, no.

416
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,820
<13-27,Sheldon>就此别过
<13-27,Sheldon>We are done here.

417
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,240
<13-27,Sheldon>不介意帮我开个门
<13-27,Sheldon>Would you mind opening the door

418
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,190
<13-27,Sheldon>等我出去后  再帮我气愤地甩门吧
<13-27,Sheldon>and then angrily slamming it behind me?

419
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,330
<13-28,Penny>-好  -多谢
<13-28,Penny>- Sure. - Thank you.

420
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,080
<13-29,Sheldon>要重重地甩
<13-29,Sheldon>And slam it hard,

421
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,020
<13-29,Sheldon>因为我火冒好几丈了
<13-29,Sheldon>because I am pretty steamed.

422
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,530
<14-1,Howard (on phone)>好  莱纳德  撑着点啊
<14-1,Howard (on phone)>All right, Leonard, hang in there.

423
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,440
<14-1,Howard (on phone)>明天见
<14-1,Howard (on phone)>Talk to you tomorrow.

424
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,510
<14-2,Bernadette>怎么了  他们才刚刚完婚不是吗
<14-2,Bernadette>What happened? They just got married.

425
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,660
<14-3,Howard>我也不知道 反正就一团乱
<14-3,Howard>I don't know. It's a mess.

426
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,330
<14-3,Howard>他们在赌城吵了一大架
<14-3,Howard>They had a huge fight in Vegas.

427
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,710
<14-4,Bernadette>你觉得他们会分手吗
<14-4,Bernadette>Think they'll break up?

428
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,890
<14-5,Howard>不确定  听起来挺严重
<14-5,Howard>I don't know. Sounds pretty bad.

429
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,740
<14-5,Howard>佩妮自己一个人在公寓里待着
<14-5,Howard>Penny's back in her apartment all by herself.

430
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,180
<14-5,Howard>是咩
<14-5,Howard>Really?

431
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,970
<15-1,Sheldon>还想再听另一个
<15-1,Sheldon>Would you like to hear another reason

432
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,020
<15-1,Sheldon>为什么男人比女人强的理由吗
<15-1,Sheldon>why men are better than women?

433
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,010
<15-2,Leonard>行啊  说一百个也无妨
<15-2,Leonard>Sure, let's make it an even hundred.

434
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,270
<15-3,Sheldon>你永远不会亲我  让我说"我爱你"
<15-3,Sheldon>You would never kiss me and make me say "I love you"

435
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,110
<15-3,Sheldon>然后再跟我分手
<15-3,Sheldon>and then break up with me.

436
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,810
<15-4,Leonard>我的确不会
<15-4,Leonard>I wouldn't.

437
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,050
<15-5,Sheldon>你知道为什么吗
<15-5,Sheldon>And you know why?

438
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,570
<15-5,Sheldon>因为你是个男人
<15-5,Sheldon>'Cause you're a man.

439
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,480
<15-5,Sheldon>高档牛逼的性别
<15-5,Sheldon>The champagne of genders.

440
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,370
<15-6,Leonard>或许我是个男人
<15-6,Leonard>Well, I may be a man,

441
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,280
<15-6,Leonard>但这一次做错事的好像是我
<15-6,Leonard>but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.

442
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,360
<15-7,Sheldon>是啊  但你像个男人一样  承认了
<15-7,Sheldon>Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man.

443
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,300
<15-7,Sheldon>你只会听到女人说
<15-7,Sheldon>All you hear women say is,

444
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,200
<15-7,Sheldon>"我想要一份色拉"
<15-7,Sheldon>"I'll just have a salad."

445
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,160
<15-7,Sheldon>"我的唇彩跑哪去了"
<15-7,Sheldon>"Where's my lip gloss?"

446
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,810
<15-7,Sheldon>"我觉得这个元素应该叫镭"
<15-7,Sheldon>"I think this element should be called radium."

447
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,200
<15-7,Sheldon>最后那句话是居里夫人说的
<15-7,Sheldon>That last one was Madame Curie.

448
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,470
<15-8,Leonard>我想到了
<15-8,Leonard>I figured that out.

449
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,230
<15-9,Sheldon>她其实应该算是荣誉男人
<15-9,Sheldon>You know what? She was kind of an honorary man.

450
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,530
<15-9,Sheldon>她有科学做的鸡鸡
<15-9,Sheldon>She had a penis made of science.

451
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,530
<15-10,Leonard>真不敢相信我的新婚之夜是跟你过
<15-10,Leonard>Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.

452
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,780
<15-10,Leonard>是吗
<15-10,Leonard>Really?

453
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,270
<15-11,Sheldon>我从没想过会有别种可能
<15-11,Sheldon>I never imagined it any other way.
