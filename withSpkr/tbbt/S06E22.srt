<1-14,Penny>你错用"酷"来形容傻事的时候真可爱
<1-14,Penny>Aw, so cute when you use the word "Cool" wrong.

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,610
<1-14,Penny>小孩就常把"意大利面"说错成"大意利面"
<1-14,Penny>Like when kids say "pasghetti."

77
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,320
<3-7,Raj>不让她会把马桶的水喝光的

78
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,670
<3-8,Howatd>我深感同情
<3-8,Howatd>I feel for ya.

79

83
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,820
<4-5,Sheldon (off)>我睡不着
<4-5,Sheldon (off)>I can't sleep.

<4-6,Leonard>我睡得着  麻烦别吵我
<4-6,Leonard>Well, I can, so shut up.

85
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,120
<4-7,Sheldon (off)>你知道还有不到九个小时
<4-7,Sheldon (off)>Do you realize that in less than nine hours,

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,060
<4-7,Sheldon (off)>亚瑟·杰弗里斯  也就是质子教授
<4-7,Sheldon (off)>Arthur Jeffries, a.k.a. Professor Proton,

87
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,630
<4-7,Sheldon (off)>将会大驾光临我们的公寓吗
<4-7,Sheldon (off)>will be in our apartment?

88
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,850
<4-8,Leonard>谢尔顿  你知道如果你整夜不睡觉
<4-8,Leonard>Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night,

89
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,410
<4-8,Leonard>你明天就会犯困
<4-8,Leonard>you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow.

90
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,610
<4-8,Leonard>犯困的谢尔顿就会变狂躁古怪
<4-8,Leonard>And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon.

91
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,050
<4-8,Leonard>而狂躁古怪的谢尔顿
<4-8,Leonard>And a cranky Sheldon...

92
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,890
<4-8,Leonard>其实跟平时的谢尔顿也没什么区别
<4-8,Leonard>is actually no different than a regular Sheldon.

93
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,830
<4-8,Leonard>晚安

<4-9,Sheldon (off)>我在考虑明天穿燕尾服
<4-9,Sheldon (off)>I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.

95
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,700
<4-10,Leonard>那一点也不可笑  晚安
<4-10,Leonard>That's not ridiculous. Good night.

96
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,980
<4-11,Sheldon (off)>你有袖扣吗
<4-11,Sheldon (off)>Do you have cufflinks?

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,630
<4-13,Sheldon (off)>-没有  -无所谓了
<4-13,Sheldon (off)>- No. - Ah, just as well.

98
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,440
<4-13,Sheldon (off)>反正凌晨3点也借不到燕尾服
<4-13,Sheldon (off)>Where can you rent a tuxedo 3:00 in the morning?

99
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,530
<4-14,Leonard>好吧  晚安
<4-14,Leonard>Okay, good night.

100
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,670
<4-15,Sheldon (off)>很高兴见到您  质子教授
<4-15,Sheldon (off)>Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

<4-15,Sheldon (off)>很高兴见到您  质子教授
<4-15,Sheldon (off)>Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

103
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,130
<4-15,Sheldon (off)>很高兴见到您  质子...
<4-15,Sheldon (off)>Nice to meet you, Prof...

104
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,320
<4-15,Sheldon (off)>莱纳德
<4-15,Sheldon (off)>Leonard?

105
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,460
<4-16,Leonard>又干嘛

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,440
<4-17,Sheldon (off)>我还是睡不着

<5-1,Howard>今天在公园真是把这小家伙累坏了
<5-1,Howard>She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?

108
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,470
<5-2,Bernadette>是啊  你们俩一起玩的时候真可爱
<5-2,Bernadette>Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.

109
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,080
<5-3,Howard>玩扔球游戏时
<5-3,Howard>It was kind of fun throwing a ball

110
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,880
<5-3,Howard>没人笑我的感觉真好
<5-3,Howard>and not having anyone laugh at me.

111
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,160
<5-4,Bernadette>你真贴心  没把球扔太远
<5-4,Bernadette>And you were sweet not to throw it too far

112
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,000
<5-4,Bernadette>是怕她的小短腿捣腾坏了吧
<5-4,Bernadette>so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,730
<5-5,Howard>是啊  我扔得近完全是出于担心
<5-5,Howard>Yeah, that's what I was doing.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,060
<5-6,Bernadette>今天有些时候
<5-6,Bernadette>You know, there were a few moments today

115
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,300
<5-6,Bernadette>我几乎觉得我们就是个小家庭
<5-6,Bernadette>when I almost felt like we were a little family.

116
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,670
<5-7,Howard>-真的吗  -真的
<5-7,Howard>- Really? - Yeah.

117
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,190
<5-8,Bernadette>我从来没想过要当一位母亲
<5-8,Bernadette>I never thought of myself as a mom,

118
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,750
<5-8,Bernadette>但当今天我们仨在外面一起玩时
<5-8,Bernadette>but when the three of us were out there having fun,

119
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,110
<5-8,Bernadette>我觉得或许某天我们真的可以建立个小家庭
<5-8,Bernadette>I felt like maybe someday we could do it.

120
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,290
<5-9,Howard>我们当然可以
<5-9,Howard>Of course we can.

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
<5-9,Howard>尤其是如果我们的宝宝也这么乖这么安静
<5-9,Howard>Especially if our baby's as calm and quiet

122
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,330
<5-9,Howard>就像这位小公主一样...
<5-9,Howard>as little Cinna...

123
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,080
<5-9,Howard>我勒个去  她不见了
<5-9,Howard>Son of a bitch, she's gone!

124
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
<5-10,Bernadette>她去哪里了
<5-10,Bernadette>Where'd she go?!

125
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,760
<5-11,Howard>我怎么知道  她又没有留个条
<5-11,Howard>I don't know! She didn't leave a note!

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,970
<5-12,Bernadette>不是你负责
<5-12,Bernadette>You were the one who was supposed

127
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,370
<5-12,Bernadette>把她放进婴儿车的吗
<5-12,Bernadette>to put her back in the stroller!

128
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,480
<5-13,Howard>才不是我  是你啊
<5-13,Howard>No, I wasn't! You were!

129
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,860
<5-15,Howard>-不是我  -就是你
<5-15,Howard>- No, I wasn't! - Yes, you were!

130
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,600
<5-16,Bernadette>好吧  你个弱鸡扔球像个娘们
<5-16,Bernadette>Yeah, well, you throw like a girl!

131
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,300
<6-1,Sheldon>我开始担心了
<6-1,Sheldon>I'm getting worried.

132
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,480
<6-2,Penny>别紧张  谢尔顿  他就晚到几分钟而已
<6-2,Penny>Relax, Sheldon, he's only a few minutes late.

133
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,600
<6-3,Sheldon>质子教授上电视时  从来不会迟到
<6-3,Sheldon>Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV.

134
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,730
<6-3,Sheldon>每天准时4点打开电视都能看见他
<6-3,Sheldon>You know, every day, 4:00, he was there.

135
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,100
<6-3,Sheldon>除非龙卷风在东德克萨斯肆虐
<6-3,Sheldon>Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas,

136
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,600
<6-3,Sheldon>这样的话  我们只能边看他边看新闻插播
<6-3,Sheldon>in which case, we'd join him in progress.

137
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,830
<6-3,Sheldon>是他打来的
<6-3,Sheldon>It's him.

138
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,220
<6-3,Sheldon>您好
<6-3,Sheldon>Hello.

139
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,780

143
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,150
<6-4,Leonard>-再见  -他在那里
<6-4,Leonard>- Bye. - Where is he?

144
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,720
<6-5,Sheldon>三楼平台那
<6-5,Sheldon>The third floor landing.

145
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,710
<6-5,Sheldon>那可怜的老头爬楼梯爬了半个小时
<6-5,Sheldon>The poor old guy's been walking up the stairs for half an hour.

146
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,900
<6-5,Sheldon>真的是你
<6-5,Sheldon>It's really you.

147
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,700
<6-6,Leonard>杰弗里斯先生  真的很抱歉
<6-6,Leonard>Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry.

148
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,030
<6-6,Leonard>我们应该提前告诉你电梯坏了
<6-6,Leonard>We should've told you about the broken elevator.

149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,060
<6-7,Arthur>我同意
<6-7,Arthur>I agree.

150
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,070
<6-8,Sheldon>质子教授  很荣幸见到你
<6-8,Sheldon>Professor Proton, it's an honor to meet you.

151
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,280
<6-9,Arthur>叫我亚瑟就行
<6-9,Arthur>Just-just call me Arthur.

153
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,170
<6-10,Sheldon>你听见了吗
<6-10,Sheldon>...you hear that?

154
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,010
<6-10,Sheldon>质子教授让我直呼他名字
<6-10,Sheldon>Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur.

155
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,270
<6-10,Sheldon>这意味着我们是朋友了
<6-10,Sheldon>That means we're friends.

156
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,640
<6-10,Sheldon>不是
<6-10,Sheldon>No.

157
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,900
<6-11,Arthur>是朋友就会先告诉我电梯坏了
<6-11,Arthur>A friend would've-would've told me about the elevator.

158
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,630
<6-12,Sheldon>快看我
<6-12,Sheldon>Look at me.

<6-12,Sheldon>我想离你多近就多近
<6-12,Sheldon>I can get as close to you as I want

160
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,130
<6-12,Sheldon>妈妈再也不用担心我的眼睛会坏掉
<6-12,Sheldon>without my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes.

161
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,360
<6-13,Arthur>他是不是个危险人物
<6-13,Arthur>Is, uh, is he dangerous?

162
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,300
<6-14,Leonard>其实他是个天才人物
<6-14,Leonard>Actually, he's a genius.

163
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,030
<6-15,Sheldon>真的哦
<6-15,Sheldon>I am.

164
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,900
<6-16,Arthur>你没有正面回答我的问题
<6-16,Arthur>Th-That doesn't answer my question.

165
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,410
<6-17,Leonard>杰弗里斯先生  我是莱纳德
<6-17,Leonard>Mr. Jeffries, I'm-I'm Leonard.

<6-20,Arthur>Well, I hope I haven't kept

169
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,590
<6-20,Arthur>楼上的孩子们等太久
<6-20,Arthur>the kids waiting too long for-for the show.

170
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,340
<6-21,Sheldon>不  楼上没有孩子
<6-21,Sheldon>Oh, no, there are no kids.

171
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,520
<6-21,Sheldon>我是你唯一的观众
<6-21,Sheldon>No, the-the show's for me.

172
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,440
<6-21,Sheldon>走吧  比比看谁先上去
<6-21,Sheldon>Come on. I'll race ya...

173
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
<6-21,Sheldon>亚瑟
<6-21,Sheldon>Arthur.

174
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,300
<6-22,Arthur>这位金发女郎真的是你的女朋友吗
<6-22,Arthur>Is the, is the blonde girl really your-your girlfriend?

175
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,530
<6-23,Leonard>是的  先生
<6-23,Leonard>Yes, sir.

176
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,770
<6-24,Arthur>你才是天才
<6-24,Arthur>You're the genius.

177
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,740
<6-25,Penny>您经常出席像这样的场合吗
<6-25,Penny>So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?

178
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,280
<6-26,Arthur>不好说
<6-26,Arthur>It-It's hard to say.

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,840
<6-26,Arthur>我至今还在琢磨
<6-26,Arthur>I'm-I'm still trying to figure out what...

180
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,870
<6-26,Arthur>你们到底请我来干嘛
<6-26,Arthur>what-what this is.

181
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,150
<6-27,Leonard>我们只是想跟你一起玩
<6-27,Leonard>We just wanted to hang out with you

182
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,600
<6-27,Leonard>或许了解下你的人生
<6-27,Leonard>and maybe learn a little about your life.

183
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,810
<6-28,Arthur>其实没什么好说的
<6-28,Arthur>Well, there-there really isn't too much to tell.

184
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,350
<6-28,Arthur>自从电视节目取消后
<6-28,Arthur>After the TV show was-was canceled,

185
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,650
<6-28,Arthur>科学界没有人
<6-28,Arthur>nobody in the scientific world

186
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,460
<6-28,Arthur>把我当真正的科学家
<6-28,Arthur>would, uh, would take me seriously.

187
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,300
<6-28,Arthur>所以为了维持生计
<6-28,Arthur>So I was forced to do these,

188
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,410
<6-28,Arthur>我只好出席一些儿童聚会
<6-28,Arthur>uh, children's parties to-to make a living.

189
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,470
<6-29,Leonard>真是太糟糕了
<6-29,Leonard>That's too bad.

190
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,900
<6-29,Leonard>但跟孩子们一起  肯定也有收获吧
<6-29,Leonard>But still, working with kids-- it must be rewarding.

191
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,800
<6-30,Arthur>常会被小孩咬
<6-30,Arthur>You-you get bit a lot.

192
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,400
<6-30,Arthur>看看我是否理解了
<6-30,Arthur>Let me see if-if I have this straight.

193
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,750
<6-30,Arthur>你们俩是物理学家
<6-30,Arthur>You-you two are-are physicists,

194
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,530
<6-30,Arthur>而你们请我来
<6-30,Arthur>and-and you, and you want me

195
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,360
<6-30,Arthur>是想让我表演一个儿童科学节目
<6-30,Arthur>to do a children's... science show?

196
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,220
<6-30,Arthur>是的
<6-30,Arthur>Yes.

197
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,430
<6-31,Sheldon>如果有多余的时间
<6-31,Sheldon>And if there's time,

198
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,530
<6-31,Sheldon>麻烦跟我们拍12张不同季节不同着装的照片
<6-31,Sheldon>take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.

199
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,950
<6-32,Arthur>我是个真正的科学家呢
<6-32,Arthur>You know, I'm a real scientist.

200
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,980
<6-32,Arthur>我是康乃尔大学的博士
<6-32,Arthur>I-I have a PhD from Cornell University.

201
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,740
<6-33,Sheldon>那很棒啊
<6-33,Sheldon>Yeah, that's great.

202
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,650
<6-33,Sheldon>你有带你的玩偶来吗
<6-33,Sheldon>Did you bring your puppet?

203
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,310
<6-34,Arthur>没有
<6-34,Arthur>No, no.

204
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,370
<6-34,Arthur>我讨厌那个玩偶
<6-34,Arthur>I-I hate that puppet.

205
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,520
<6-34,Arthur>不会吧
<6-34,Arthur>Oh, no.

206
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,630
<6-35,Sheldon>怎么会有人讨厌
<6-35,Sheldon>How could anybody hate

207
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,880
<6-35,Sheldon>中微子基诺呢
<6-35,Sheldon>Gino the Neutrino?

208
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,480
<6-35,Sheldon>很棒吧
<6-35,Sheldon>It's nice, huh?

209
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
<6-35,Sheldon>我在易趣上买的  20块
<6-35,Sheldon>I got him for 20 bucks on eBay.

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,890
<6-35,Sheldon>还包邮哦  亲

211
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,150
<6-36,Arthur>这不是梦  对吗
<6-36,Arthur>I'm... I'm awake, right?

212
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,230
<6-36,Arthur>这一切都真实在发生
<6-36,Arthur>Th-This is happening?

213
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,950
<7-1,Bernadette>小肉桂
<7-1,Bernadette>Cinnamon!

214
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,770
<7-1,Bernadette>小肉桂
<7-1,Bernadette>Cinnamon!

215
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,610
<7-3,Bernadette>她没有回应可能是因为
<7-3,Bernadette>You know, maybe she doesn't recognize her name

216
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,690
<7-3,Bernadette>我们没用拉杰的口音
<7-3,Bernadette>because of Raj's accent.

217
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,910
<7-4,Howard>这想法靠谱
<7-4,Howard>Good thinking.

218
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,150
<7-4,Howard>小肉桂  到爸爸碗里来
<7-4,Howard>Cinnamon, come to Daddy!

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,690
<7-7,Bernadette>-惟妙惟肖啊  -谢谢
<7-7,Bernadette>- Nice. - Thanks.

222
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,430
<7-8,Howard>这事完了以后  别把那嗓音忘了
<7-8,Howard>When this all blows over, remember that voice.

223
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,640
<7-8,Howard>挺让我性趣盎然的
<7-8,Howard>It's kind of a turn-on.

224
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,500
<7-9,Bernadette>我学拉杰说话会让你兴奋吗
<7-9,Bernadette>It turns you on when I sound like Raj?

225
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,080
<7-9,Bernadette>小肉桂
<7-9,Bernadette>Cinnamon!

226
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,100
<8-1,Arthur>我把鸡蛋放在上面
<8-1,Arthur>Okay, as-as I put the egg on top,

227
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,510
<8-1,Arthur>等火焰熄灭
<8-1,Arthur>and-and the flame goes out

228
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,680
<8-1,Arthur>烧瓶里的气压减小
<8-1,Arthur>and-and the air pressure decreases in-in the flask,

229
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,010
<8-1,Arthur>你们认为会发生什么
<8-1,Arthur>what do you think will happen?

230
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,030
<8-2,Penny>我好像知道
<8-2,Penny>I think I know.

231
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,870
<8-3,Sheldon>鸡蛋会被吸进去
<8-3,Sheldon>It's gonna get sucked in.

232
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,180
<8-3,Sheldon>它会被吸进去
<8-3,Sheldon>It's going to get sucked in.

233
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,940
<8-4,Penny>好吧  我不知道
<8-4,Penny>Okay, I didn't know.

234
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,370
<8-5,Sheldon>答对了
<8-5,Sheldon>Yes!

235
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,270
<8-6,Penny>瞧  我不是他们那种科学家
<8-6,Penny>See, I'm not a scientist like them.

236
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,590
<8-7,Arthur>我发现了
<8-7,Arthur>I-I figured that out.

238
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,020
<8-8,Sheldon>土豆钟  做土豆钟的实验吧
<8-8,Sheldon>Uh, potato clock. Do potato clock.

239
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,330
<8-9,Penny>那是什么
<8-9,Penny>What's that?

240
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,970
<8-10,Arthur>用土豆给钟充电
<8-10,Arthur>I-I power a clock with a, with a potato.

241
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,200
<8-10,Arthur>不可能吧
<8-10,Arthur>Shut up!

242
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,220
<8-11,Penny>还能这样啊
<8-11,Penny>You can do that?

243
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,590
<8-11,Penny>我是说
<8-11,Penny>I mean...

244
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,550
<8-11,Penny>这样不就能解决世界能源危机了吗
<8-11,Penny>wouldn't that solve the world's energy crisis?

245
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,080
<8-11,Penny>还真不能
<8-11,Penny>No.

246
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,200
<8-12,Arthur>伙计们
<8-12,Arthur>Look, guys,

247
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,110
<8-12,Arthur>留着你们的钱  我觉得
<8-12,Arthur>keep your money. I-I think, uh...

248
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,880
<8-12,Arthur>我觉得我该走了
<8-12,Arthur>I-I think I'm done.

249
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,460
<8-13,Sheldon>怎么了
<8-13,Sheldon>What-what's wrong?

250
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,690
<8-13,Sheldon>是她惹你生气了吗
<8-13,Sheldon>Is she upsetting you?

251
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,820
<8-13,Sheldon>我可以让她走的
<8-13,Sheldon>Because I can make her go away.

252
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,000
<8-14,Arthur>我是看在她的面子上才待这么久的
<8-14,Arthur>No, sh-she's the only reason I've-I've stayed this long.

253
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,430
<8-15,Leonard>那是为什么
<8-15,Leonard>Then what is it?

254
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,360
<8-15,Leonard>我也不知道
<8-15,Leonard>I don't know.

255
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,260
<8-16,Arthur>我觉得我只是
<8-16,Arthur>I think I'm just...

256
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,670
<8-16,Arthur>只是不想
<8-16,Arthur>I-I just, I just don't want to be

257
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,460
<8-16,Arthur>再当质子教授了
<8-16,Arthur>Professor Proton anymore.

258
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,010
<8-17,Sheldon>你怎么能说这种话
<8-17,Sheldon>Well, how can you say that?

259
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,830
<8-17,Sheldon>质子教授最棒了
<8-17,Sheldon>Professor Proton's the best.

260
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,360
<8-18,Arthur>我可不这么想
<8-18,Arthur>What-what has it ever gotten me?

261
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,620
<8-18,Arthur>我都是83岁的老头了
<8-18,Arthur>I mean, I'm-I'm an 83-year-old man who has...

262
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,910
<8-18,Arthur>箱子里还放着土豆
<8-18,Arthur>potatoes in-in his suitcase.

263
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,560
<8-18,Arthur>其他科学家把我视为笑柄
<8-18,Arthur>Other scientists think-think I'm a joke.

264
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,580
<8-18,Arthur>还有
<8-18,Arthur>And the...

265
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,300
<8-18,Arthur>负责操控基诺的木偶师
<8-18,Arthur>the puppeteer who did, who did Gino...

266
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,970
<8-18,Arthur>他也...
<8-18,Arthur>well, he also...

267
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,000
<8-18,Arthur>"操"控了我老婆
<8-18,Arthur>did my wife.

268
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,220
<8-18,Arthur>杰弗里斯先生
<8-18,Arthur>Mr. Jeffries,

269
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,780
<8-19,Sheldon>我得给你看点东西
<8-19,Sheldon>I need to show you something.

270
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,250
<8-20,Penny>对于你的痛苦  我很遗憾
<8-20,Penny>I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.

271
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,510
<8-21,Arthur>谢谢
<8-21,Arthur>Uh, thanks.

272
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,970
<8-22,Penny>如果你不介意的话
<8-22,Penny>But if you don't mind me asking,

273
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,880
<8-22,Penny>我想问问土豆钟是怎么运作的
<8-22,Penny>the potato clock, how does it work?

274
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,170
<8-22,Penny>是钟有猫腻  还是土豆有猫腻
<8-22,Penny>Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?

275
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,390
<8-23,Arthur>你们俩平时都交流些啥
<8-23,Arthur>Wh-What do you two talk about?

276
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,290
<8-24,Sheldon>我小时候在德克萨斯给你写过一封信
<8-24,Sheldon>I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas,

277
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,450
<8-24,Sheldon>你送了我这个有你亲笔签名的照片
<8-24,Sheldon>and you sent this autographed picture back to me.

278
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,790
<8-24,Sheldon>还记得吗
<8-24,Sheldon>Do you remember that?

279
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,990
<8-25,Arthur>我给你个提示吧
<8-25,Arthur>I'll-I'll give you a hint:

280
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,580
<8-25,Arthur>我平时戴着写着自己的地址的手链[老人痴呆]
<8-25,Arthur>I have a bracelet with my own address on it.

281
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,320
<8-26,Sheldon>总之
<8-26,Sheldon>Well, anyway, um,

282
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,100
<8-26,Sheldon>你可能觉得难以置信
<8-26,Sheldon>you may find this hard to believe,

283
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,530
<8-26,Sheldon>但其实我从小到大没什么朋友
<8-26,Sheldon>but I didn't have any friends growing up.

284
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,730
<8-27,Arthur>这我完全理解
<8-27,Arthur>No, I-I get that.

285
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,540
<8-28,Sheldon>但是  我有你
<8-28,Sheldon>But, um, I did have you.

286
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,420
<8-28,Sheldon>每天下午四点钟
<8-28,Sheldon>And every day at 4:00,

287
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,190
<8-28,Sheldon>我在家看你在68频道的节目
<8-28,Sheldon>you'd come to my house on Channel 68,

288
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,710
<8-28,Sheldon>我们都一起玩科学游戏
<8-28,Sheldon>and we'd do science together.

289
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,710
<8-28,Sheldon>要不是你的话
<8-28,Sheldon>If it hadn't been for you,

290
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,580
<8-28,Sheldon>谁知道我现在会变成什么样
<8-28,Sheldon>well, who knows what would've become of me?

291
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,170
<8-28,Sheldon>我可能当不成世界一流的物理学家
<8-28,Sheldon>You know? Instead of a world-class physicist,

292
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,440
<8-28,Sheldon>而成为流浪汉
<8-28,Sheldon>I could've wound up as a-a hobo.

293
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,130
<8-28,Sheldon>或者外科医生
<8-28,Sheldon>Or a surgeon.

294
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,360
<8-29,Leonard>我相信世上每天都有许多重要的科学发现
<8-29,Leonard>I bet there are important discoveries being made every day

295
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,290
<8-29,Leonard>这都归功于你启发了无数的孩子去追求科学
<8-29,Leonard>because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science.

296
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,840
<8-29,Leonard>从某种角度来说  他们的发现就是你的发现
<8-29,Leonard>In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.

297
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,770
<8-30,Sheldon>是真的
<8-30,Sheldon>Yeah, it's true.

298
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,990
<8-30,Sheldon>整整一代年轻的科学家
<8-30,Sheldon>A generation of young scientists

299
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,240
<8-30,Sheldon>都是靠你启发才有了今天
<8-30,Sheldon>are standing on your shoulders.

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,690
<8-31,Arthur>谢谢你们
<8-31,Arthur>Well, thank-thank you, guys.

301
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,560
<8-31,Arthur>这番话对我意义非凡
<8-31,Arthur>That... that-that means a lot.

302
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,900
<8-32,Leonard>你要知道你在我们心目中的份量  这很重要
<8-32,Leonard>Well, it's important you know how much you mean to us.

303
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,150
<8-34,Penny>亚瑟  你还好吗
<8-34,Penny>Arthur, are you okay?

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,660
<8-37,Penny>用土豆来充电可以吗
<8-37,Penny>Any chance we could plug it into the potato?

308
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,380
<8-37,Penny>不行
<8-37,Penny>No.

309
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,050
<8-37,Penny>你好

<9-1,Raj>Oh, and if she's hungry, go ahead and feed her.

316
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,840
<9-1,Raj>但别给她带淀粉的食物
<9-1,Raj>But do not give her anything starchy.

317
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,860
<9-1,Raj>它晚餐要吃意式调味饭
<9-1,Raj>She's having risotto for dinner.

<9-1,Raj>Your vitals are stable,

319
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,330
<10-1,Paramedic>但还是去医院做些检查  以防万一
<10-1,Paramedic>but let's take you in for some tests just to be safe.

320
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,220
<10-2,Leonard>需要我们中的谁陪你坐救护车吗
<10-2,Leonard>You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?

321
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,820
<10-3,Sheldon>我去
<10-3,Sheldon>I'll do it!

322
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,490
<10-4,Arthur>他不是亲属  不能让他陪同  对吧
<10-4,Arthur>He's not a relative, he's not allowed, right?

323
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,930
<10-5,Paramedic>没这样的规矩  他可以去
<10-5,Paramedic>No, that's not a rule. He can go.

324
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,210
<10-6,Sheldon>太好了
<10-6,Sheldon>Oh, yeah!

325
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,580
<10-7,Arthur>今天我连喘口气的机会都没有
<10-7,Arthur>I can't catch a break today.

326
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,250
<10-8,Penny>我们收拾好你的东西  就去医院看你
<10-8,Penny>We'll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.

327
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,280
<10-9,Leonard>很抱歉事情发展成这样
<10-9,Leonard>I'm sorry things turned out this way.

328
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,740
<10-10,Arthur>到了这个地步  我只能
<10-10,Arthur>Well, at-at this point, I'm just...

329
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,060
<10-10,Arthur>庆幸下楼时有人来抬我走
<10-10,Arthur>glad someone's carrying me down the stairs.

330
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,040
<10-11,Sheldon>不仅见到我儿时的英雄
<10-11,Sheldon>Met my childhood hero,

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,070
<10-11,Sheldon>还能和他一起坐救护车
<10-11,Sheldon>now I get to ride in an ambulance.

332
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,740
<10-11,Sheldon>如果能再让他拍挂历照片
<10-11,Sheldon>Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar,

333
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,590
<10-11,Sheldon>这将是我人生中最美好的一天
<10-11,Sheldon>this'll be the best day ever.

334
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,250
<11-1,Bernadette>真不敢相信把她弄丢了
<11-1,Bernadette>Can't believe we lost her.

335
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,250
<11-1,Bernadette>我想什么呢
<11-1,Bernadette>What was I thinking?

336
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,210
<11-1,Bernadette>我会是个糟糕的母亲
<11-1,Bernadette>I'd be a terrible mom.

337
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,930
<11-2,Howard>或许第一个孩子时  你做得不够好
<11-2,Howard>Well, maybe with the first one.

338
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,230
<11-2,Howard>但孩子就跟煎薄饼一样
<11-2,Howard>But kids are like pancakes.

339
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,330
<11-2,Howard>第一个总是要扔掉的废品
<11-2,Howard>The first one's always a throwaway.

340
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,310
<11-2,Howard>-怎么样  -挺好的
<11-2,Howard>- How's this look? - It's fine.

341
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,230
<11-3,Bernadette>你哪弄来的她的照片
<11-3,Bernadette>Where'd you get that picture of her?

342
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,860
<11-4,Howard>这不是她
<11-4,Howard>It's not her.

343
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,380
<11-4,Howard>我只是谷歌了一下"被当亲生娃的狗"
<11-4,Howard>I just Googled "Foo-foo little dogs."

344
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,160
<11-4,Howard>是拉杰  别出声
<11-4,Howard>It's Raj. Stay quiet.

345
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,530
<11-4,Howard>真不凑巧
<11-4,Howard>Bad timing.

346
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,150
<11-4,Howard>伯纳黛特刚刚带小肉桂出门溜达了
<11-4,Howard>Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.

347
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,820
<11-5,Raj>有意思
<11-5,Raj>Interesting.

348
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,000
<11-5,Raj>他们溜到谎言巷了吗
<11-5,Raj>Did they take a walk down Liars' Lane?

349
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,560
<11-6,Howard>什么
<11-6,Howard>What?

350
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,220
<11-7,Raj>说谎者出入的小巷
<11-7,Raj>A lane frequented by liars.

351
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,490
<11-7,Raj>比如说你  你这个大骗子
<11-7,Raj>Like you, you big liar!

352
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,500
<11-8,Howard>她居然在你那里
<11-8,Howard>You have her?

353
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,490
<11-9,Bernadette>谢天谢地她没事
<11-9,Bernadette>Oh, thank God she's okay.

354
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,420
<11-10,Raj>我相信你  你却让我失望了
<11-10,Raj>Well, I trusted you, and you let me down.

355
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,960
<11-10,Raj>可怜的小家伙抖了几小时了
<11-10,Raj>The poor thing's been shaking for hours.

356
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,300
<11-11,Howard>真是对不起
<11-11,Howard>I'm really sorry.

357
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,330
<11-12,Bernadette>等等  你已经找到它几小时了吗
<11-12,Bernadette>Hang on, you've had her for hours?

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,740
<11-13,Raj>对  我去接了它
<11-13,Raj>Yes. I picked her up,

359
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,400
<11-13,Raj>两人一起去做了个按摩  放松下来
<11-13,Raj>and then we both went for massages to try and calm down.

360
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,340
<11-13,Raj>然后去粉红桨果店吃了酸奶
<11-13,Raj>And then we got Pinkberry.

361
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,420
<11-14,Bernadette>你知道她没事
<11-14,Bernadette>So you knew she was okay,

362
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,560
<11-14,Bernadette>就不会接我们电话告诉我们吗
<11-14,Bernadette>and you couldn't pick up the phone to tell us?

363
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,090
<11-15,Raj>那个  我想...
<11-15,Raj>Well, I-I thought about...

366
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,090
<11-16,Bernadette>我们都觉得她已经不在人世了
<11-16,Bernadette>She could have been dead for all we knew!

367
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,210
<11-16,Bernadette>你应该觉得羞愧
<11-16,Bernadette>You should be ashamed of yourself!

<11-19,Howard>这招"良心不安"真高
<11-19,Howard>Nice guilt trip.
