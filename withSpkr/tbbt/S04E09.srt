1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,170
<1-1,Raj>你知道漫画英雄世界里谁最有种吗
<1-1,Raj>You know who's gonna be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe?

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,700
<1-1,Raj>能给女浩克做比基尼蜜蜡除毛的最有种
<1-1,Raj>Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,090
<1-2,Howard>要说有种嘛
<1-2,Howard>You want to talk brave,

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,720
<1-2,Howard>美国队长那位从墨西哥偷渡过来的园丁怎么样
<1-2,Howard>how about Captain America's undocumented Mexican gardener?

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,430
<1-3,Leonard>他比不上那个每次办完事后都上厕所的哥们
<1-3,Leonard>He's not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,460
<1-4,Sheldon>果不其然  你们又错了
<1-4,Sheldon>As usual, you're all wrong.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,320
<1-4,Sheldon>漫画英雄世界里最有种的人
<1-4,Sheldon>The bravest person in the Marvel Universe

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,050
<1-4,Sheldon>是那位给金刚狼做前列腺检查的医生
<1-4,Sheldon>is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,570
<1-5,Howard>那被金刚狼做前列腺检查的哥们儿呢
<1-5,Howard>How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,340
<1-6,Sheldon>你这是抬杠吧
<1-6,Sheldon>Now you're just being silly.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
<1-6,Sheldon>金刚狼可从来没表示过
<1-6,Sheldon>Wolverine's never displayed

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,830
<1-6,Sheldon>对帮助他人预防前列腺癌的
<1-6,Sheldon>the slightest interest in helping others

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,820
<1-6,Sheldon>有一点点兴趣
<1-6,Sheldon>prevent prostate cancer.

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,160
<1-6,Sheldon>喂
<1-6,Sheldon>Hello.

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,350
<1-6,Sheldon>对  电梯坏掉了
<1-6,Sheldon>Yes, the elevator's out of order;

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,520
<1-6,Sheldon>你得爬楼梯了
<1-6,Sheldon>you'll have to use the stairs.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,800
<1-6,Sheldon>你当然可以
<1-6,Sheldon>Of course you can.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,200
<1-6,Sheldon>披萨的历史可以追溯到16世纪
<1-6,Sheldon>Pizza dates back to the 16th century,

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,470
<1-6,Sheldon>可世界上第一部电梯1852年才面世
<1-6,Sheldon>while the first elevator was not installed until 1852.

22
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,040
<1-6,Sheldon>也就是说在三百多年的时间里
<1-6,Sheldon>That means that for over 300 years,

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,730
<1-6,Sheldon>人们都是爬楼梯送披萨的
<1-6,Sheldon>people carried pizzas up stairs.

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,030
<1-6,Sheldon>请继承这一光荣传统吧
<1-6,Sheldon>Be part of that proud tradition.

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,560
<1-7,Leonard>趁他往披萨上吐口水的功夫  我去叫佩妮过来
<1-7,Leonard>I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,110
<1-8,Raj>你觉得金刚狼是不是有个金刚不坏前列腺呢
<1-8,Raj>Do you think they gave Wolverine an adamantium prostate?

27
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,940
<1-9,Howard>这问题真傻逼
<1-9,Howard>That's a stupid question.

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,600
<1-10,Raj>我们不是在讨论如何检查超级英雄的菊花吗
<1-10,Raj>We're having a conversation about probing the heinie of superheroes.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,850
<1-10,Raj>这有什么傻逼的
<1-10,Raj>There are no stupid questions.

30
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,980
<2-1,Man>找谁啊
<2-1,Man>Yes?

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,860
<2-2,Leonard>哦  佩妮在吗
<2-2,Leonard>Oh, um, is Penny here?

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,920
<2-3,Man>你就是莱纳德  对吗
<2-3,Man>You're Leonard, right?

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,620
<2-4,Leonard>对啊
<2-4,Leonard>Yeah.

34
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,970
<2-5,Man>妈的  终于见到你了  小子
<2-5,Man>Damn, it's good to finally meet you, son.

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,900
<2-6,Leonard>有谁能给我补充点背景知识吗
<2-6,Leonard>Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,760
<2-7,Penny>嗨  莱纳德  你见过我爸爸了
<2-7,Penny>Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,310
<2-8,Leonard>哇  好了
<2-8,Leonard>Oh, good.

38
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,660
<2-8,Leonard>背景清楚了
<2-8,Leonard>Context.

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,630
<2-9,Penny’s Dad>进来吧  伙计
<2-9,Penny’s Dad>Come on in, buddy.

40
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,380
<2-9,Penny’s Dad>进来坐会儿
<2-9,Penny’s Dad>Take a load off.

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,860
<2-10,Penny>老爸  莱纳德没时间
<2-10,Penny>Oh, gee, Dad, Leonard can't stay.

42
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,260
<2-10,Penny>他只是顺道来打招呼的
<2-10,Penny>He just dropped by to say hello.

43
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,490
<2-10,Penny>谢谢你过来  亲爱的
<2-10,Penny>Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.

44
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,690
<2-10,Penny>咱俩回聊
<2-10,Penny>I'll see you later.

45
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,930
<2-10,Penny>拜
<2-10,Penny>Bye.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,020
<2-11,Leonard>真诡异
<2-11,Leonard>That was odd.

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,320
<2-11,Leonard>生活大爆炸
<2-11,Leonard>第四季第九集

48
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,220
<3-1,Sheldon>你确定这点儿漫画书就够了吗
<3-1,Sheldon>Are you sure you have enough comics?

49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,720
<3-1,Sheldon>到时候你可得守12个小时的望远镜
<3-1,Sheldon>You're going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours,

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,470
<3-1,Sheldon>而据我估算你挑的这些书
<3-1,Sheldon>and by my estimate, you've only selected

51
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,700
<3-1,Sheldon>只够看7个小时的
<3-1,Sheldon>seven hours of reading material.

52
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,500
<3-1,Sheldon>我还算上了
<3-1,Sheldon>That's even factoring in

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,970
<3-1,Sheldon>你纠结美国漫画书里这些俚语的时间
<3-1,Sheldon>your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms

54
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,050
<3-1,Sheldon>比如"嘭"  "唰"
<3-1,Sheldon>like "Bamf!" and "Snikt!"

55
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,410
<3-2,Raj>他这算种族歧视吗
<3-2,Raj>Is that racist?

56
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,910
<3-2,Raj>我觉得挺像的
<3-2,Raj>It feels racist.

57
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,450
<3-3,Howard>别太敏感了
<3-3,Howard>Don't be oversensitive.

58
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,340
<3-3,Howard>他是说你文盲  又不是说印度人都文盲
<3-3,Howard>He's calling you illiterate, not your race.

59
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
<3-4,Raj>哦  那就好
<3-4,Raj>Oh, okay. Good.

60
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,270
<3-4,Raj>我不用再挑漫画书了
<3-4,Raj>I don't need more comics.

61
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,630
<3-4,Raj>霍华德到时候会过来  我们会一起玩
<3-4,Raj>Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play

62
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,410
<3-4,Raj>星际战舰和印度大富翁
<3-4,Raj>Intergalactic Battleship and Indian Monopoly.

63
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,280
<3-5,Sheldon>我可不喜欢大富翁的新版本
<3-5,Sheldon>I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,210
<3-5,Sheldon>我更喜欢经典的  普通版的和克林贡版的
<3-5,Sheldon>I prefer the classics: regular and Klingon.

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,140
<3-6,Howard>其实印度大富翁
<3-6,Howard>Actually, Indian Monopoly's

66
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,410
<3-6,Howard>和普通版差不多  只是钱变成了卢比
<3-6,Howard>just like regular, except the money's in rupees,

67
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,670
<3-6,Howard>酒店变成了呼叫中心而已
<3-6,Howard>instead of hotels you build call centers,

68
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,930
<3-6,Howard>如果你抽机会卡  有可能死于痢疾
<3-6,Howard>and when you pick a Chance card, you might die of dysentery.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,830
<3-6,Howard>顺便告诉你
<3-6,Howard>Just FYI,

70
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,640
<3-6,Howard>这才叫种族歧视
<3-6,Howard>that was racist.

71
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,980
<3-7,Leonard>你们肯定猜不到刚才发生了什么
<3-7,Leonard>You'll never guess what just happened.

72
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,350
<3-8,Sheldon>你走在去门厅的路上
<3-8,Sheldon>You went out in the hallway,

73
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,200
<3-8,Sheldon>一不小心跌进了异次元空间之门
<3-8,Sheldon>stumbled into an interdimensional portal

74
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,400
<3-8,Sheldon>来到了5000年后的未来
<3-8,Sheldon>which brought you 5,000 years into the future,

75
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,290
<3-8,Sheldon>然后你在那里利用当时的先进技术
<3-8,Sheldon>where you took advantage of the advanced technology

76
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,610
<3-8,Sheldon>造了一架时间机器  现在你是回来
<3-8,Sheldon>to build a time machine, and now you're back

77
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,960
<3-8,Sheldon>接我们去7010年
<3-8,Sheldon>to bring us all with you to the year 7010

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,290
<3-8,Sheldon>那时候我们就能被派到飞海豚利用通灵术
<3-8,Sheldon>where we are transported to work at the Thinkatorium

79
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,410
<3-8,Sheldon>控制的思维水族馆工作了
<3-8,Sheldon>by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?

80
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,430
<3-10,Sheldon>错
<3-10,Sheldon>No.

81
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,320
<3-11,Leonard>佩妮刚才吻了我
<3-11,Leonard>Penny kissed me.

82
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,490
<3-12,Sheldon>这怎么猜得出来
<3-12,Sheldon>Well, who would ever guess that?

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,620
<3-13,Raj>是  是哪种吻啊
<3-13,Raj>What-what kind of a kiss?

84
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,730
<3-14,Leonard>长吻啊  嘴对嘴的
<3-14,Leonard>A big kiss. On the mouth.

85
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,020
<3-15,Howard>会不会是她本来想吻你的脸的
<3-15,Howard>Is it possible that she was going for your cheek

86
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,880
<3-15,Howard>结果你的脸一偏她就亲到嘴唇了
<3-15,Howard>and you moved and she accidentally got lip?

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,590
<3-15,Howard>我跟我妈经常这样
<3-15,Howard>That happens with me and my mom all the time.

88
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,770
<3-16,Leonard>她跟她老爸介绍了我
<3-16,Leonard>She introduced me to her father,

89
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,000
<3-16,Leonard>吻完我以后就当我面把门关了
<3-16,Leonard>kissed me and then shut the door in my face.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,990
<3-16,Leonard>也许这是暗示
<3-16,Leonard>Maybe she was trying to send you a message.

91
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,670
<3-17,Leonard>真的吗
<3-17,Leonard>You think?

92
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,060
<3-18,Howard>是啊  暗示"这个男的不是我爸爸
<3-18,Howard>Yeah. "This man is not my father.

93
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,350
<3-18,Howard>我被挟持了
<3-18,Howard>I'm being held hostage.

94
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,100
<3-18,Howard>所以我要做一些
<3-18,Howard>So I'm going to do

95
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,210
<3-18,Howard>疯狂之举好暗示你
<3-18,Howard>something insane in the hopes

96
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,990
<3-18,Howard>去报警"
<3-18,Howard>that you'll call 911."

97
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,530
<3-19,Leonard>佩妮吻我可不是什么疯狂之举
<3-19,Leonard>Penny kissing me is not insane.

98
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,020
<3-19,Leonard>她以前经常吻我的
<3-19,Leonard>She used to kiss me all the time.

99
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,890
<3-20,Sheldon>爱因斯坦对精神病的定义是  "翻来覆去地
<3-20,Sheldon>Einstein defined insanity as "Doing the same thing

100
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,230
<3-20,Sheldon>重复一件事并期冀得到不同的结果"
<3-20,Sheldon>over and over again and expecting different results."

101
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,840
<3-20,Sheldon>根据这个标准
<3-20,Sheldon>By that standard,

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,320
<3-20,Sheldon>佩妮病得不轻
<3-20,Sheldon>Penny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

103
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,720
<3-21,Leonard>我只是觉得
<3-21,Leonard>I'm just saying,

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,780
<3-21,Leonard>那个吻有些意味深长
<3-21,Leonard>it felt like it may have meant something.

105
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,460
<3-22,Howard>这话让我想起从前了
<3-22,Howard>Ah, this takes me back.

106
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,470
<3-22,Howard>那时候佩妮让莱纳德如此着迷
<3-22,Howard>Leonard obsessing about Penny.

107
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,540
<3-22,Howard>别误会  我挺喜欢你现在的状态
<3-22,Howard>I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff,

108
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,430
<3-22,Howard>但偶尔听听你的痴情独白还是蛮有意思的
<3-22,Howard>but once in a while it's nice to hear the hits.

109
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,970
<3-23,Raj>你再说一遍"我们的孩子会才貌双全"
<3-23,Raj>Do "Our babies will be smart and beautiful."

110
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,680
<3-23,Raj>每次想起这句话我就笑得不行
<3-23,Raj>That one always makes me laugh.

111
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,600
<3-24,Leonard>我真是吃饱了撑着跟你们聊天
<3-24,Leonard>Why do I bother talking to you people?

112
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
<3-25,Sheldon>我想说其实我们根本没在听  可能你会感觉好点
<3-25,Sheldon>If it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.

113
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,470
<3-26,Penny (at door)>能出来说句话吗
<3-26,Penny (at door)>Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?

114
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,010
<3-27,Leonard>当然
<3-27,Leonard>Yeah, sure.

115
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,500
<3-28,Sheldon>我有预感那个披萨永远也不会送来了
<3-28,Sheldon>I'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza.

116
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,070
<3-29,Penny>你可能在琢磨刚才是怎么回事
<3-29,Penny>So you're probably wondering what that was all about.

117
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,940
<3-30,Leonard>什么  你指你吻我那件事吗
<3-30,Leonard>What, uh, the kissing and everything?

118
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,710
<3-30,Leonard>没什么  经常有女人对我这样的啦
<3-30,Leonard>Nah, women do that to me all the time.

119
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,380
<3-31,Penny>好吧  实际上  我貌似
<3-31,Penny>Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of

120
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,540
<3-31,Penny>跟我爸说我们又在一起了
<3-31,Penny>told my father we got back together again.

121
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,970
<3-32,Leonard>什么  为什么

<3-33,Penny>第一个被他认可的人  知道吗
<3-33,Penny>he's ever really approved of, you know?

124
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,750
<3-33,Penny>你是个上过大学的科学家
<3-33,Penny>You're a scientist who went to college

125
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,030
<3-33,Penny>你脖子上没有纹身
<3-33,Penny>and you don't have a neck tattoo

126
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,640
<3-33,Penny>不是通缉犯  也没孩子
<3-33,Penny>or outstanding warrants or...or a baby.

127
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,150
<3-34,Leonard>你以前都跟什么人在一起啊
<3-34,Leonard>What kind of guys did you used to go out with?

128
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,460
<3-35,Penny>就是一般人呗
<3-35,Penny>Just guys.

129
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,710
<3-35,Penny>总之  他知道我们分手了以后伤心的要命
<3-35,Penny>Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken,

130
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,430
<3-35,Penny>他总是问我  莱纳德好吗
<3-35,Penny>and he kept bugging me,"How's Leonard?

131
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,010
<3-35,Penny>你为什么就不能跟莱纳德和好呢
<3-35,Penny>Why can't you get back together with Leonard?

132
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,900
<3-35,Penny>我敢说莱纳德从来不会惹祸上身
<3-35,Penny>I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself."

134
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
<3-35,Penny>所以为了让他不再烦我
<3-35,Penny>So to get him off my back,

135
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,910
<3-35,Penny>我就跟他说咱俩和好了
<3-35,Penny>I told him we worked things out.

136
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,470
<3-36,Leonard>是吗
<3-36,Leonard>Really?

137
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,110
<3-36,Leonard>咱俩是怎么和好的
<3-36,Leonard>How-how'd we manage that?

138
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,670
<3-37,Penny>什么
<3-37,Penny>What?

139
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,050
<3-38,Leonard>你道歉了吗
<3-38,Leonard>I mean, did you apologize?

140
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,130
<3-38,Leonard>还是你跑来追我了
<3-38,Leonard>Did you have to woo me?

141
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,490
<3-39,Penny>少做白日梦了
<3-39,Penny>Get over yourself.

<3-40,Leonard>Yeah, no, I don't think so.

144
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,450
<3-41,Penny>好吧  你干吗要跟我争这个
<3-41,Penny>Okay, why are you arguing about this?

145
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,160
<3-41,Penny>我只是想说
<3-41,Penny>I'm just saying,

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,230
<3-42,Leonard>如果我们假装和好
<3-42,Leonard>if we fake got back together,

147
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,940
<3-42,Leonard>那也肯定不是这么和好的
<3-42,Leonard>that's totally not how it fake happened.

148
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,070
<3-43,Penny>好吧  随便啦
<3-43,Penny>Okay, whatever.

149

<3-43,Penny>你能不能就跟我装到我爸离开为止
<3-43,Penny>Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?

150
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,400
<3-44,Leonard>等一下  你真的想让我

<7-1,Howard>哎呀  不能走了  一头圣牛挡住了我去路
<7-1,Howard>Whoops. Can't go any further. There's a sacred cow in my way.

<7-2,Raj>伯纳黛特  你能不能告诉你男友
<7-2,Raj>Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend

264
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,780
<7-2,Raj>别再纠结印度圣牛的笑话了
<7-2,Raj>to cool it with the cow jokes.

265
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,670
<7-3,Bernadette>没用的
<7-3,Bernadette>It won't help.

266
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,310
<7-3,Bernadette>他要是找到一个笑话  就会一直讲个不停
<7-3,Bernadette>Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.

267
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,190
<7-3,Bernadette>没错
<7-3,Bernadette>Yeah.

268
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,770
<7-4,Raj>就比如他理发那次
<7-4,Raj>Like his haircut material.

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,800
<7-6,Raj>"不  我全部理光了"
<7-6,Raj>"No. I got them all cut."

271
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,500
<7-7,Bernadette>现在还是真好笑呀
<7-7,Bernadette>Which is still so funny.

272
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,800
<7-8,Raj>你去到一家中餐馆
<7-8,Raj>And when you go to a Chinese restaurant,

276
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,190
<7-10,Howard>好吧  你们侃我侃够了吧
<7-10,Howard>Okay, I think that's enough about me.

277
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,890
<7-11,Raj>没错  我们开始侃他老妈
<7-11,Raj>He's right. Let's make fun of his mother.

278
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,450
<7-11,Raj>霍华德  快来帮我搓脚
<7-11,Raj>"Howard, come rub my feet!

<7-12,Bernadette>霍华德  快把我从浴缸里拉起来
<7-12,Bernadette>"Howard, help me out of the tub!

284
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,900
<8-1,Leonard>闭嘴
<8-1,Leonard>Shut up.

285
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,940
<8-2,Penny>你知道前一个小时我都在做什么吗
<8-2,Penny>You know what I've been doing for the last hour?

286
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,640
<8-3,Leonard>在本子上涂鸦心目中的
<8-3,Leonard>Mm, dreamily doodling "Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter"

287
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,270
<8-3,Leonard>"霍夫斯塔德太太"形象吗
<8-3,Leonard>in a notebook?

288
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,360
<8-4,Penny>听我爸不停念叨
<8-4,Penny>Listening to my father go on and on

289
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,980
<8-4,Penny>你是个多么棒的人
<8-4,Penny>about what a great guy you are.

290
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,880
<8-5,Leonard>你得承认  我的确很讨人喜欢
<8-5,Leonard>You got to admit, I am... I'm delightful.

291
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,970
<8-6,Penny>你干嘛把事情搞这么复杂
<8-6,Penny>Why are you making this so difficult?

292
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,080
<8-7,Leonard>哪里复杂了
<8-7,Leonard>It's not difficult for me.

293
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,880
<8-7,Leonard>我觉得很有趣
<8-7,Leonard>I'm having fun.

294
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,520
<8-8,Penny>莱纳德
<8-8,Penny>Leonard.

295
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,270
<8-9,Leonard>那你要我怎么样  是你挑起来的
<8-9,Leonard>What do you want me to do? You started this.

296
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,950
<8-9,Leonard>你想过去告诉他我们分手了吗
<8-9,Leonard>Do you want to go over and tell him we're broken up?

297
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,360
<8-11,Leonard>-不想  -那你想怎么样
<8-11,Leonard>- No. - Well, then, what do you want?

298
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,280
<8-12,Penny>我不知道
<8-12,Penny>I don't know.

299
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,400
<8-13,Leonard>难道你在跑过来之前
<8-13,Leonard>Don't you think that's something you should

300
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,430
<8-13,Leonard>不应该先想想清楚吗
<8-13,Leonard>have figured out before you stomped over here?

301
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,070
<8-14,Penny>好吧  也许是
<8-14,Penny>Maybe.

302
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,370
<8-15,Sheldon>莱纳德  佩妮  刚好你们在
<8-15,Sheldon>Leonard, Penny, excellent.

303
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,090
<8-15,Sheldon>我想说我很高兴你们又在一起了
<8-15,Sheldon>I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together,

304
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,080
<8-15,Sheldon>如果我能有法子让自己显得更真诚些
<8-15,Sheldon>and if I can figure out a way to do so

305
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,370
<8-15,Sheldon>我肯定会不遗余力
<8-15,Sheldon>and sound sincere, I will.

306
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,190
<8-15,Sheldon>与此同时
<8-15,Sheldon>In the meantime,

307
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,070
<8-15,Sheldon>我要对室友协议进行一些修订
<8-15,Sheldon>I'd like to go over some proposed changes

308
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,530
<8-15,Sheldon>特别要提出关于佩妮
<8-15,Sheldon>to the roommate agreement specifically to address

309
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,740
<8-16,Penny>十分烦人的个人习惯
<8-16,Penny>Penny's annoying personal habits.

310
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,200
<8-16,Penny>我的老天
<8-16,Penny>Oh, my God.

311
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,230
<8-16,Penny>-什么个人习惯  -我列了个单子
<8-16,Penny>- What personal habits? - I have a list.

312
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,630
<8-17,Leonard>顺便  第12条就是"我的天啊"的滥用
<8-17,Leonard>FYI, overuse of the phrase "Oh, my God" is number 12.

313
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,700
<8-18,Penny>好吧  谢尔顿  你没必要这么做
<8-18,Penny>Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this

314
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,430
<8-19,Leonard>-因为我和莱纳德不...  -吡吡吡吡吡
<8-19,Leonard>- because Leonard and I are not... Ba-ba-ba-ba.

315
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,290
<8-19,Leonard>你确定要把他也牵扯进来吗
<8-19,Leonard>Are you sure you want to include him in this?

316
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,870
<8-20,Sheldon>牵扯进什么东西
<8-20,Sheldon>Include me in what?

317
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,170
<8-20,Sheldon>有什么正在策划中的阴谋?
<8-20,Sheldon>Is there a plot afoot?

318
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,090
<8-20,Sheldon>我可绝对不参与阴谋
<8-20,Sheldon>I'll have no truck with plots.

319
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,110
<8-21,Penny>好吧  你是对的
<8-21,Penny>No, you're right.

320
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,220
<8-21,Penny>不不  没有情节  不用卡车也不用走路
<8-21,Penny>No, there's... there's no plots, no trucks, no feet.

321
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,550
<8-21,Penny>还有什么烦人的习惯要讨论
<8-21,Penny>So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?

322
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,780
<8-22,Sheldon>我们不是讨论
<8-22,Sheldon>Uh, we don't discuss anything.

323
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,460
<8-22,Sheldon>莱纳德签署了室友协议
<8-22,Sheldon>Leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement.

324
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,170
<8-22,Sheldon>所以  他对你的违规行为
<8-22,Sheldon>As such, he bears responsibility

325
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,540
<8-22,Sheldon>负有全责  并必须支付罚款
<8-22,Sheldon>for all your infractions and must pay all fines.

326
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,280
<8-23,Leonard>-罚款  -是的
<8-23,Leonard>- Fines? - Yes.

327
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,810
<8-24,Sheldon>如果佩妮又要继续在这过夜
<8-24,Sheldon>If Penny's going to be spending nights here again,

328
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,470
<8-24,Sheldon>你就得建立一个托管帐户
<8-24,Sheldon>you'll need to set up an escrow account.

329
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,130
<8-24,Sheldon>在这签名
<8-24,Sheldon>Sign here.

331
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,240
<9-1,Raj>我是帕萨迪纳市的库萨帕里博士
<9-1,Raj>This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena.

332
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,260
<9-1,Raj>你想请你改放望远镜的位置
<9-1,Raj>I'd like you to reposition the telescope, please.

333
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,140
<9-1,Raj>斯嘉丽·约翰逊的家[著名女演员  超靓]
<9-1,Raj>Scarlett Johansson's house!

334
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,270
<9-1,Raj>开玩笑的啦  夏威夷
<9-1,Raj>I'm kidding, Hawaii.

335
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,830
<9-1,Raj>多谢啦[夏威夷语]
<9-1,Raj>Mahalo.

336
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,920
<9-1,Raj>嗷呜
<9-1,Raj>Whoo!

337
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,500
<9-2,Howard>我们开第二瓶酒
<9-2,Howard>It might have been a mistake

338
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,030
<9-2,Howard>根本就是个错误
<9-2,Howard>to open that second bottle of wine.

339
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,930
<9-3,Bernadette>吃一堑长一智嘛
<9-3,Bernadette>Well, live and learn.

340
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,620
<9-3,Bernadette>拉杰  你觉得你找的那个星球上
<9-3,Bernadette>So, Raj, do you think this planet you're looking for

341
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,140
<9-3,Bernadette>拥有适合生命生存的环境吗
<9-3,Bernadette>could have an atmosphere that supports life?

342
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,270
<9-3,Bernadette>也许吧
<9-3,Bernadette>Maybe.

343
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,280
<9-4,Raj>如果真是  我就出名了
<9-4,Raj>If it did, I'd be famous.

344
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,120
<9-4,Raj>我会成为杂志封面人物
<9-4,Raj>I'd be on the cover of magazines.

345
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
<9-4,Raj>那我就不用孤独一人住小公寓了
<9-4,Raj>And then, instead of living alone

346
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,130
<9-4,Raj>而是能住大豪宅
<9-4,Raj>in my tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.

347
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,280
<9-5,Bernadette>听起来真棒
<9-5,Bernadette>That sounds great.

348
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,980
<9-6,Raj>的确
<9-6,Raj>It is.

349
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,700
<9-6,Raj>如果你想一个人住空荡荡的房子
<9-6,Raj>If you like wandering around a big, empty house

350
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,850
<9-6,Raj>却没人爱着你
<9-6,Raj>with no one to love you.

351
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,070
<9-7,Howard>-我们会去看你  -不会的
<9-7,Howard>- We'd come visit you. - No, you wouldn't.

352
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,020
<9-8,Raj>你们会被我的财富和名声吓倒
<9-8,Raj>You'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame.

353
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,360
<9-8,Raj>我的朋友只有我那转基因的猴子管家
<9-8,Raj>My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler

354
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,850
<9-8,Raj>还有我雇来的那侏儒真人象棋
<9-8,Raj>and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.

355
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,550
<9-9,Bernadette>他要开始变阴郁了吧
<9-9,Bernadette>He's taking a turn to the dark side, isn't he?

356
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,280
<9-10,Howard>再看看  他说不定能恢复的
<9-10,Howard>Hold on. He could come back.

357

<9-11,Raj>哦  这一切到底有何意义
<9-11,Raj>Oh, what's the point of everything?

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,790
<9-12,Howard>没戏了  他彻底醉了

<9-13,Raj>You know it's been more than a year

360
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,410
<9-13,Raj>没吻过姑娘了
<9-13,Raj>since I've even kissed a girl?

361
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,800
<9-14,Howard>你跟我说的在动漫展搭上的那姑娘呢
<9-14,Howard>What about that hookup at Comic-Con you told me about?

<9-15,Raj>醒醒吧  我在骗人
<9-15,Raj>Oh, grow up. I was lying.

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,750
<9-15,Raj>我一直在骗人  没人愿意吻我
<9-15,Raj>I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.

364
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,690
<9-16,Bernadette>可怜的小东西
<9-16,Bernadette>Oh, you poor, poor thing.

<9-16,Bernadette>很多姑娘都会愿意吻你的
<9-16,Bernadette>There are a lot of girls out there who'll want to kiss you.

380
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,300
<10-5,Wyatt (phone rings)>所以出去买咖啡了  回来的时候碰到莱纳德
<10-5,Wyatt (phone rings)>so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back.

381

<10-5,Wyatt (phone rings)>对  就坐在他们沙发上钓着呢
<10-5,Wyatt (phone rings)>Yeah. Right here on his couch.

<10-7,Wyatt>什么
<10-7,Wyatt>What?

387
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,210
<10-7,Wyatt>我明白了
<10-7,Wyatt>I see.

388
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,840
<10-7,Wyatt>这些都是瞎编的  是吗
<10-7,Wyatt>The whole thing's bull squirt, huh?

389
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,790
<10-7,Wyatt>我真是失望  再见
<10-7,Wyatt>Well, that's very disappointing. Bye.

390
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,900
<10-8,Leonard>我一直有话想跟你说
<10-8,Leonard>There's been something I've been meaning to tell you.

391
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,780
<11-1,Wyatt>真不敢相信  你们会这么骗我
<11-1,Wyatt>I can't believe you would lie to me like that.

392
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,560
<11-2,Leonard>声明一下  我也是身不由己的
<11-2,Leonard>Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.

393
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,340
<11-3,Wyatt>我等下再找你算账
<11-3,Wyatt>I'll get to you in a minute.

395
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,060
<11-5,Wyatt>我的亲生女儿  觉得我不够爱她到
<11-5,Wyatt>That my own daughter thinks I don't love her enough

396
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,760
<11-5,Wyatt>不管她怎么选择我都会支持她
<11-5,Wyatt>to support her no matter what choices she makes--

397
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,030
<11-5,Wyatt>这太伤我心了
<11-5,Wyatt>well, that hurts me deeply.

<11-9,Wyatt>I thought we were past the days

400
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,740
<11-9,Wyatt>不会再蒙骗我了
<11-9,Wyatt>when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes.

401
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,560
<11-9,Wyatt>说你内衣抽屉里的小袋子是香包
<11-9,Wyatt>Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri?

402
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,510
<11-9,Wyatt>卫生间里的验尿棒是查糖尿病的
<11-9,Wyatt>And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?

<11-11,Wyatt>but all I ask is you respect me enough

407
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,780
<11-11,Wyatt>要对我说实话
<11-11,Wyatt>to be honest about them.

<11-12,Penny>你说得对  从今以后我一定对你说实话
<11-12,Penny>You're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.

<11-19,Wyatt>我不想再面对什么滑板白痴  白人说唱歌手
<11-19,Wyatt>I can't go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers

416
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,420
<11-19,Wyatt>还有那些反戴帽子满身汗臭的蠢驴们
<11-19,Wyatt>and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.

<11-20,Leonard>天  我不知道我是否还有机会
<11-20,Leonard>Gee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.

<12-1,Sheldon>Just so you know, I was up all night,

432
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,610
<12-1,Sheldon>终于完成了
<12-1,Sheldon>but I have finally completed

433
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,190
<12-1,Sheldon>针对佩妮部分的新室友协议
<12-1,Sheldon>the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.

434
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,580
<12-2,Leonard>不必了  我们又分手了
<12-2,Leonard>Yeah well, not necessary. We broke up again.

435
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,230
<12-3,Sheldon>你有没有为别人着想过  莱纳德
<12-3,Sheldon>Do you even think about other people, Leonard?

436
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,610
<12-3,Sheldon>你想过没有
<12-3,Sheldon>Do you?

437
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,190
<13-1,Raj>昨晚怎么样
<13-1,Raj>Oh, how'd it go last night?

438
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,450
<13-2,Leonard>你知道的
<13-2,Leonard>Oh, you know.

439
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,250
<13-3,Raj>都一样的  没啥变化
<13-3,Raj>Same old, same old.

440
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,950
<13-3,Raj>通过望远镜看到些星星  就是大惊喜了
<13-3,Raj>Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.

441
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,650
<13-3,Raj>真的吗
<13-3,Raj>Really?

442
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,110
<13-4,Leonard>这望远镜你可等了几个月了  怎么了
<13-4,Leonard>You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?

443
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,860
<13-5,Raj>干嘛  采访我写书吗
<13-5,Raj>Why? You writing a book?

444
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,430
<13-6,Sheldon>我提出个假设
<13-6,Sheldon>I'm going to propose a hypothesis.

445
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,940
<13-6,Sheldon>昨晚  拉杰偶然与外星文明联络上了
<13-6,Sheldon>Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization

446
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,740
<13-6,Sheldon>然后被美国政府要求严格保密
<13-6,Sheldon>and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.

447
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,020
<13-7,Raj>啥事都没有  能换个话题吗
<13-7,Raj>Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?

448
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,640
<13-8,Sheldon>这话一听就是排演过的  我们不是唯一智慧生命
<13-8,Sheldon>That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.

449
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,260
<13-11,Sheldon>昨晚你顺利把玩上拉杰的大望远镜了吗
<13-11,Sheldon>You get to play with Raj's big telescope last night?

450
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,080
<13-13,Raj>这话从何说起
<13-13,Raj>Where did that come from?

451
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,560
<13-16,Raj>他从未碰过我的望远镜
<13-16,Raj>He never touched my telescope.

452
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,070
<13-17,Howard>你给我闭嘴
<13-17,Howard>Way to go shutting up.

453
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,420
<13-18,Raj>我闭嘴了  你也给我闭嘴
<13-18,Raj>I did shut up. Now you shut up.

454
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,200
<13-20,Raj>-好吧  -谢谢
<13-20,Raj>- Fine.  - Thank you.

455
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,020

<13-20,Raj>I can't believe you didn't call me this morning.
