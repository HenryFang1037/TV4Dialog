<9-14,Raj>Oh, look at all that chest hair.

<8-14,Bernadette>Son of a bitch, he bit me.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,660
<8-14,Bernadette>我还是去自己急诊室确认一下吧
<8-14,Bernadette>Okay, I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,590
<8-14,Bernadette>华仔  这只是你的臆想病犯了
<8-14,Bernadette>Howie, this is just your hypochondria.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,030
<8-14,Bernadette>我坐到静音键上  以为自己聋了
<8-14,Bernadette>When I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf,

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,140
<8-14,Bernadette>那才叫臆想病
<8-14,Bernadette>that was my hypochondria.

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,980
<8-14,Bernadette>我们另找个时间告诉他我怀孕了吧
<8-14,Bernadette>We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,850
<1-3,Howard>我不知道
<1-3,Howard>I don't know.

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,120
<1-4,Bernadette>也许后面写了什么吧
<1-4,Bernadette>Maybe it says something on the back.

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,060
<1-5,Howard>"后续提示  请看牛奶盒"
<1-5,Howard>"Continued on milk."

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,140
<1-5,Howard>如果你是想骗我自己做早饭
<1-5,Howard>If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast,

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,040
<1-5,Howard>我妈从前没成功  你也别想得逞
<1-5,Howard>it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.

20

<1-6,Bernadette>"是"
<1-6,Bernadette>"Are."

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,970

00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,590
<1-5,Howard>"预知后事  请看勺子"
<1-5,Howard>"See spoons for more."

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,180
<1-6,Bernadette>会是什么呢
<1-6,Bernadette>What could it be?

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,630
<1-6,Bernadette>"我们是格鲁特"
<1-6,Bernadette>"We are Groot"?

25
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,390
<1-6,Bernadette>"我们是冠军"

26
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,810
<1-6,Bernadette>"我们是一家人"
<1-6,Bernadette>"We are family"?

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,570
<1-6,Bernadette>"我永远同我的姐妹们在一起"
<1-6,Bernadette>"I got all my sisters with me."

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,140
<1-7,Howard>你是说真的吗
<1-7,Howard>Are you serious?

29
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,180
<1-8,Bernadette>是的
<1-8,Bernadette>Yeah.

30
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,400
<1-9,Howard>你确定吗
<1-9,Howard>Are you sure?

31
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,480
<1-10,Bernadette>确定一定以及肯定[阳性]
<1-10,Bernadette>Pretty positive.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,430
<1-10,Bernadette>这是个双关语笑话  因为怀孕测试也是...
<1-10,Bernadette>That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says...

33
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,670
<1-10,Bernadette>我的天啊
<1-10,Bernadette>Oh, my God.

34
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,680
<1-10,Bernadette>太棒了
<1-10,Bernadette>This is incredible.

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,070
<1-11,Howard>我们要当爸爸妈妈了
<1-11,Howard>We're gonna be parents?

36
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,070
<1-11,Howard>以后我们可以优先上飞机了
<1-11,Howard>We're gonna get to board planes first.

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,090
<1-11,Howard>终于可以看看
<1-11,Howard>Finally gonna get to see

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,290
<1-11,Howard>商场的家庭卫生间长什么样子了
<1-11,Howard>what's in that family bathroom at the mall.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,720
<1-12,Bernadette>我知道  这事太疯狂了
<1-12,Bernadette>I know, it's crazy.

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
<1-13,Howard>简直超乎想象
<1-13,Howard>It is crazy.

41
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,950
<1-13,Howard>这种事情该如何准备呢
<1-13,Howard>I mean, how do you... prepare for something like this?

42
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,060
<1-13,Howard>我都不确定自己以前抱过婴儿没有
<1-13,Howard>I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.

43
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,610
<1-14,Bernadette>没关系  你会慢慢学会的
<1-14,Bernadette>Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.

44
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,560
<1-15,Howard>可还有其他的事呢
<1-15,Howard>But how's this all gonna work?

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,760
<1-15,Howard>我们需要找保姆吗
<1-15,Howard>Do we get a nanny?

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,230
<1-15,Howard>我是说  我们请得起保姆吗
<1-15,Howard>I mean, can we afford a nanny?

47
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,610
<1-15,Howard>就算请得起  也不能找漂亮的
<1-15,Howard>And if we can, we can't get a pretty one,

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,720
<1-15,Howard>否则我们的婚姻就会出现危机
<1-15,Howard>'cause it'll wreck our marriage.

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,910
<1-15,Howard>但也不能找太丑的  否则会吓坏宝宝的
<1-15,Howard>We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.

50
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,530
<1-16,Bernadette>我不知道  华仔
<1-16,Bernadette>I-I don't know, Howie.

51
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,940
<1-17,Howard>我们这里算是好学区吗
<1-17,Howard>Are we in a good school district?

52
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,900
<1-17,Howard>你信天主教  我是犹太人
<1-17,Howard>You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.

53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,730
<1-17,Howard>我们的孩子应该信什么教呢
<1-17,Howard>What religion do we raise it?

54
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,560
<1-17,Howard>如果生了男孩  应该让他行割礼吗
<1-17,Howard>And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,710
<1-17,Howard>有人说割礼是野蛮的行为
<1-17,Howard>People say it's barbaric,

56
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,000
<1-17,Howard>但如果不割  看起来又像面包裹腊肠
<1-17,Howard>but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,350
<1-18,Bernadette>冷静一下  一切都会好的
<1-18,Bernadette>Calm down, it's gonna be okay.

58
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,760
<1-18,Bernadette>怎么可能会好
<1-18,Bernadette>How's it gonna be okay?

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,480
<1-19,Howard>你看看我  我整个人一团糟
<1-19,Howard>Look at me, I'm a mess.

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,690
<1-19,Howard>这就表示这孩子会是半团糟
<1-19,Howard>And that means this baby's gonna half a mess.

61
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,960
<1-19,Howard>孩子早就输在起跑线上了
<1-19,Howard>And that's even before we screw it up

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,610
<1-19,Howard>加上保姆廉价长相一般就更惨了
<1-19,Howard>with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.

73
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,790
<2-1,Leonard>拉杰  我看新闻说你们学院的一群人
<2-1,Leonard>Hey, Raj, I read a couple guys in your department

74
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,290
<2-1,Leonard>好像在太阳系发现了新的行星
<2-1,Leonard>may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?

75
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,770
<2-2,Sheldon>我也听说了
<2-2,Sheldon>Oh, I heard about that.

76
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,100
<2-2,Sheldon>怎么不是你发现的呢
<2-2,Sheldon>Why didn't you discover it?

77
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,120
<2-3,Raj>因为我没有泡在望远镜室里
<2-3,Raj>Because instead of being in the telescope room,

78
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,120
<2-3,Raj>而是忙着给你们几个做节日手工果酱
<2-3,Raj>I was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays.

79
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,570
<2-4,Sheldon>当你凭借波森莓果酱
<2-4,Sheldon>Well, you be sure to let us know

83
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,080
<2-9,Howard>先等一等
<2-9,Howard>Yeah, um, in a minute.

84
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,540
<2-9,Howard>我有事要告诉你们
<2-9,Howard>I actually need to tell you guys something.

85
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,120
<2-10,Raj>如果是为了12月的手工果酱说谢谢
<2-10,Raj>If it's "Thank you" for the homemade jam you got in December,

86
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,010
<2-10,Raj>恭喜你  你是第一个这么做的人
<2-10,Raj>congratulations, you're the first one.

87
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,410
<2-11,Leonard>出什么事了
<2-11,Leonard>What's going on?

88
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,250
<2-12,Howard>那个  我...

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,340
<2-15,Sheldon>太糟了
<2-15,Sheldon>Oh, no.

92
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,670
<2-16,Leonard>你干嘛说太糟了
<2-16,Leonard>Why "Oh, no"?

93
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,660
<2-17,Sheldon>因为所有的事都要改变了
<2-17,Sheldon>Because this changes everything.

94
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,230
<2-17,Sheldon>咱们以后的漫画之夜怎么办
<2-17,Sheldon>What about comic book night?

95
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,790
<2-17,Sheldon>我们还能愉快地一起打游戏吗
<2-17,Sheldon>Uh, what about playing games together?

96
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,700
<2-17,Sheldon>我们还能一起去迪斯尼乐园吗
<2-17,Sheldon>What about our trips to Disneyland?

97
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,990
<2-17,Sheldon>以后有了孩子  我们还怎么做这些事呀
<2-17,Sheldon>How can we do those things with a child around?

98
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,060
<2-18,Leonard>别紧张  我们大家可以忍受两个小宝宝
<2-18,Leonard>Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.

99
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,390
<2-19,Sheldon>我勒个去
<2-19,Sheldon>Oh, dear Lord...

100
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,510
<2-19,Sheldon>佩妮也怀孕了吗
<2-19,Sheldon>Penny's pregnant, too?

101
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,450
<2-20,Leonard>另一个宝宝就是你
<2-20,Leonard>You're the other baby.

102
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,570
<2-21,Sheldon>真的吗
<2-21,Sheldon>Oh, really?

103
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,980
<2-21,Sheldon>有哪个宝宝每隔11天就需要刮一次胡子啊
<2-21,Sheldon>Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?

104
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,610
<2-22,Leonard>有哪个成年人会拒绝吃他的全麦饼干
<2-22,Leonard>Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers

105
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,810
<2-22,Leonard>仅仅因为其中一块破掉了吗
<2-22,Leonard>because one of them was broken?

106
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,360
<2-23,Sheldon>这局我们俩平手
<2-23,Sheldon>I guess we'll call this a draw.

107
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,150
<3-1,Bernadette>我很高兴你们俩都在这里
<3-1,Bernadette>So, I'm glad you guys are here.

108
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,350
<3-1,Bernadette>有件事我要告诉你们
<3-1,Bernadette>There's something I want to share with you.

<3-1,Bernadette>华仔和我要...
<3-1,Bernadette>Howie and I are going to...

110
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,060
<3-2,Penny (reading text)>莱纳德说你怀孕了
<3-2,Penny (reading text)>Leonard says you're pregnant.

111
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,950
<3-3,Amy>什么
<3-3,Amy>What?

112
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,540
<3-4,Penny>"不要说出来
<3-4,Penny>"Don't say anything.

113
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,740
<3-4,Penny>她告诉你时要装成很惊讶的样子"
<3-4,Penny>Act surprised when she tells you."

114
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,050
<3-4,Penny>好吧  你想我们怎么演
<3-4,Penny>All right, how you want to do this?

115
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,530
<3-5,Bernadette>我怀孕了
<3-5,Bernadette>I'm pregnant.

116
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,290
<3-6,Penny>我的天  我真不敢相信
<3-6,Penny>Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

117
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,680
<3-7,Amy>太激动人心了
<3-7,Amy>This is so exciting!

118
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,180
<3-8,Bernadette>是呀  是挺让人激动的
<3-8,Bernadette>Yeah, it's all real exciting.

119
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,250
<3-9,Penny>你  你不开心吗
<3-9,Penny>Are-are you not happy about this?

120
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,110
<3-10,Bernadette>开心呀  我当然开心
<3-10,Bernadette>I am. Of-of course I am. I'm...

121
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,530
<3-10,Bernadette>可能只是荷尔蒙作祟吧
<3-10,Bernadette>I'm sure it's just the hormones.

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,980
<3-10,Bernadette>但还是很奇怪
<3-10,Bernadette>But it's weird--

123
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,610
<3-10,Bernadette>华仔这么多年来一直想要小孩
<3-10,Bernadette>Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years,

124
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,210
<3-10,Bernadette>我本来很开心地告诉他
<3-10,Bernadette>and I was all excited to tell him

125
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,350
<3-10,Bernadette>以为他会激动到疯掉
<3-10,Bernadette>because I thought he'd be thrilled,

126
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,810
<3-10,Bernadette>结果他慌成一团
<3-10,Bernadette>but then he started to flip out

127
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,590
<3-10,Bernadette>搞得我现在觉得这不是好事
<3-10,Bernadette>and now this feels like a bad idea

128
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,100
<3-11,Penny>而且我还会变胖
<3-11,Penny>and I'm gonna get fat.

129
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,330
<3-11,Penny>不  不  别这样  你不会变胖
<3-11,Penny>No, no, come on. Come on, you're not gonna get fat.

130
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,410
<3-11,Penny>你只会越来越美  焕发母性的光辉
<3-11,Penny>You're gonna be beautiful and glowing

131
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,450
<3-11,Penny>变成最性感最可爱的孕妈宝贝
<3-11,Penny>and-and have the cutest little baby bump ever.

132
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,550
<3-12,Bernadette>你说起来倒容易  你个瘦皮猴
<3-12,Bernadette>Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.

133
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,460
<3-12,Bernadette>抱歉  都是荷尔蒙作祟
<3-12,Bernadette>Sorry, hormones.

134
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,100
<3-13,Penny>没关系  我只听到了"瘦"这个字
<3-13,Penny>Oh, that's all right. All I heard was "skinny."

135
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,080
<3-14,Amy>虽然霍华德的表现和你想象的不一样
<3-14,Amy>I wouldn't make too much out of Howard

136
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,090
<3-14,Amy>但我觉得你不用担心
<3-14,Amy>not reacting the way you expected him to.

137
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,010
<3-15,Penny>没错  他只是一开始有点被吓到了
<3-15,Penny>Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.

138
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,340
<3-16,Bernadette>你们说得对
<3-16,Bernadette>You're probably right.

139
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,980
<3-16,Bernadette>我们好好谈过之后  他开始平静下来了
<3-16,Bernadette>After we talked about it, he started to calm down.

140
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,050
<4-1,Howard>我就不该养孩子
<4-1,Howard>I shouldn't be raising a kid.

141
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,750
<4-1,Howard>我自己都不爱吃蔬菜
<4-1,Howard>I don't even eat my own vegetables.

142
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,870
<4-2,Leonard>老兄  你可能反应过度了
<4-2,Leonard>Buddy, I-I think you might be overreacting.

143
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,680
<4-3,Howard>还有我这个鼻子
<4-3,Howard>And then there's this nose.

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,910
<4-3,Howard>如果他长得像我怎么办
<4-3,Howard>I mean, what if he looks like me?

145
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
<4-3,Howard>更糟糕的是...
<4-3,Howard>Or worse...

146
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,750
<4-3,Howard>如果女儿长得像我怎么办
<4-3,Howard>what if she looks like me?

147
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,990
<4-4,Sheldon>更别提对我们这个社交圈子的影响了
<4-4,Sheldon>Not to mention the impact on our social circle.

148
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,170
<4-4,Sheldon>所有一切都会随之改变
<4-4,Sheldon>Everything's going to change.

149
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,080
<4-4,Sheldon>霍华德不能像以前那样频繁地过来了
<4-4,Sheldon>Howard won't be able to come over as much.

150
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,460
<4-5,Raj>他也可以把孩子带来呀
<4-5,Raj>Well, he could bring the baby here.

151
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,740
<4-6,Sheldon>但那样的话  我们就得给公寓装上婴儿保护了
<4-6,Sheldon>Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment.

152
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,020
<4-6,Sheldon>我姐姐的厕所里就有那么一个马桶锁
<4-6,Sheldon>You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.

153
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,260
<4-6,Sheldon>我拥有双博士学位  都只能憋屈尿洗手池里
<4-6,Sheldon>I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.

154
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,900
<4-7,Howard>天啊  你们知不知道
<4-7,Howard>Oh, my God, and do you have any idea

155
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,510
<4-7,Howard>养一个孩子有多费钱啊
<4-7,Howard>how expensive having a kid is?

156
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,230
<4-8,Raj>有人写过  在洛杉矶养一个孩子到念完大学
<4-8,Raj>I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college

157
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,900
<4-8,Raj>费用超过一百万美元
<4-8,Raj>can cost over a million dollars.

158
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,270
<4-8,Raj>一百万美元
<4-8,Raj>A million dollars?

159
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,040
<4-9,Howard>不行了  感觉我蛋蛋相攻  蛋疼不已
<4-9,Howard>God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.

160
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,480
<4-9,Howard>好的  我懂了
<4-9,Howard>That's it-- I got to start

161
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,760
<4-9,Howard>我要现在就开始多赚钱
<4-9,Howard>earning more money right now.

162
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,340
<4-10,Raj>我知道了  你可以跟伯纳黛特申请
<4-10,Raj>I know-- you could ask Bernadette

163
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,720
<4-10,Raj>让她多给你点零花钱
<4-10,Raj>for a raise in your allowance.

164
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,530
<4-11,Howard>这不是玩笑
<4-11,Howard>This isn't a joke.

165
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,500
<4-12,Raj>我没开玩笑
<4-12,Raj>I wasn't joking.

166
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,470
<4-13,Leonard>船到桥头自然直
<4-13,Leonard>It'll be fine.

167
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,980
<4-13,Leonard>天天都有人生孩子
<4-13,Leonard>People have kids every day.

168
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,920
<4-13,Leonard>你会想到办法的
<4-13,Leonard>You'll figure this out.

169
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,580
<4-14,Raj>就是  别这样
<4-14,Raj>Yeah, come on,

170
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,250
<4-14,Raj>你也知道  这是大好的消息
<4-14,Raj>this is great news and you know it.

171
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,490
<4-15,Howard>你说得对  我只是
<4-15,Howard>You're right, it is, I'm just...

172
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,070
<4-15,Howard>一时有些接受不了
<4-15,Howard>A little overwhelmed right now.

173
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,820
<4-16,Leonard>知道我们该去干嘛吗
<4-16,Leonard>Hey, you know what we should do?

174
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,920
<4-17,Sheldon>全体去做输精管切除术  以免后患吗
<4-17,Sheldon>All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?

175
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,250
<4-18,Leonard>一起出去庆祝
<4-18,Leonard>Go out and celebrate.

176
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,270
<4-18,Leonard>刚才不是你说过最差的主意
<4-18,Leonard>But not your worst idea.

177
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,260
<5-1,Amy>我们一起去放松放松心情吧
<5-1,Amy>Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.

178
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,700
<5-2,Penny>好啊  我们应该出去
<5-2,Penny>Yeah, yeah, we should go out.

179
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,720
<5-3,Bernadette>去哪
<5-3,Bernadette>Where?

180
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,360
<5-4,Penny>不知道  酒吧
<5-4,Penny>Uh, I don't know, a bar?

181
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,460
<5-5,Bernadette>不能喝酒
<5-5,Bernadette>Can't drink.

182
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,050
<5-6,Penny>我们能喝  但好吧
<5-6,Penny>We can, but all right.

183
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,730
<5-7,Amy>你饿吗  要不要去你喜欢的那家寿司店
<5-7,Amy>Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?

184
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,490
<5-8,Bernadette>医生说我不能吃寿司
<5-8,Bernadette>Doctor said I can't have sushi.

185
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,990
<5-9,Penny>好的  我们也可以哪都不去
<5-9,Penny>Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.

186
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,860
<5-9,Penny>我们可以就待在这  在浴缸里聊天
<5-9,Penny>We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.

187
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,660
<5-10,Bernadette>医生说我不能泡浴缸
<5-10,Bernadette>Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.

188
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,460
<5-11,Amy>要不你还是换个医生吧
<5-11,Amy>Maybe you should get a new doctor.

189
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,520
<5-11,Amy>干嘛  他也说了你不能笑吗
<5-11,Amy>What, he said you can't laugh either?

190
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,420
<6-1,Raj>让我们举杯敬我们的朋友  霍华德
<6-1,Raj>I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard--

191
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,310
<6-1,Raj>一个胸怀宽广  灵魂美丽
<6-1,Raj>his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul...

192
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,670
<6-2,Leonard>穿着勒蛋小紧裤
<6-2,Leonard>And his tight little pants

193
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,140
<6-2,Leonard>也没有因此不育的男人
<6-2,Leonard>that somehow did not make him sterile.

194
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,490
<6-3,All>干杯
<6-3,All>Cheers.

195
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,820
<6-4,Howard>看这个
<6-4,Howard>Well, look at this.

196
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,840
<6-4,Howard>发明这个小雨伞的人
<6-4,Howard>I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas

197
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,740
<6-4,Howard>估计是不用担心没钱了
<6-4,Howard>doesn't have to worry about money.

198
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,970
<6-4,Howard>他想生几个孩子就生几个
<6-4,Howard>He can have all the kids he wants.

199
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,310
<6-5,Sheldon>还能挡掉头顶的一小部分区域的雨滴
<6-5,Sheldon>And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.

200
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,330
<6-6,Howard>如果我要养这个孩子
<6-6,Howard>If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid,

201
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,110
<6-6,Howard>必须想出超级赚钱的点子
<6-6,Howard>I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.

202
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,350
<6-7,Leonard>没理由不行啊
<6-7,Leonard>There's no reason you can't.

203
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,300
<6-7,Leonard>你说得倒容易
<6-7,Leonard>That's easy for you to say.

204
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,010
<6-8,Howard>你和谢尔顿已经想出了超流氦模型
<6-8,Howard>You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.

205
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,050
<6-9,Leonard>那只是研究
<6-9,Leonard>That's just research.

206
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,760
<6-9,Leonard>根本没机会用来赚钱
<6-9,Leonard>We're never gonna make any money from it.

207
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,730
<6-10,Sheldon>去他的氦  这杯子里的旁趣酒
<6-10,Sheldon>Forget helium. The real superfluid

208
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,560
<6-10,Sheldon>才是真正的超流逼
<6-10,Sheldon>is the fruit punch in this mug.

209
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,940
<6-10,Sheldon>让我想起我爸的秘密
<6-10,Sheldon>Reminds me of my daddy's secret

210
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,210
<6-10,Sheldon>"不许告诉妈妈"果汁
<6-10,Sheldon>"Don't Tell Mama" juice.

211
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,170
<6-11,Leonard>这酒挺烈的  你慢点喝
<6-11,Leonard>Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.

212
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,700
<6-12,Sheldon>那我再喝最后一口
<6-12,Sheldon>I'll just take one last sip.

213
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,770
<7-1,Howard>好吧  这个发明怎么样
<7-1,Howard>Okay, how about this for an invention--

214
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,550
<7-1,Howard>稍微大一点的鸡尾酒小雨伞
<7-1,Howard>slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.

215
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,830
<7-2,Leonard>这算什么新发明
<7-2,Leonard>How is that a new invention?

216
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,030
<7-3,Howard>我不知道  苹果公司也只是产品大小变换
<7-3,Howard>I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things

217
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,260
<7-3,Howard>我们不也买个不停吗
<7-3,Howard>and we keep buying them.

218
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,590
<7-4,Raj>真的  我对我的大iPad
<7-4,Raj>It's true. I like my giant iPad

219
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,340
<7-4,Raj>和我的小iPad的喜爱
<7-4,Raj>and my little iPad

220
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,760
<7-4,Raj>几乎等同于我对正常尺寸iPad的喜爱
<7-4,Raj>almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.

221
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,350
<7-5,Sheldon>这个地方太棒了
<7-5,Sheldon>This place is terrific.

222
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,860
<7-5,Sheldon>我们之前怎么没来过
<7-5,Sheldon>Why-why have we never been here before?

223
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,770
<7-6,Leonard>跟其他好玩却不能做的事一样  因为你啊
<7-6,Leonard>The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff-- you.

224
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,130
<7-7,Sheldon>挺伶牙俐齿  牙尖嘴利
<7-7,Sheldon>That's some smart talk from a guy

225
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,270
<7-7,Sheldon>就是脸上焦距老跑掉啊
<7-7,Sheldon>who can't even keep his face in focus.

226
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,210
<7-10,Raj>厕所在哪
<7-10,Raj>Where's the bathroom?

227
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,530
<7-8,Raj>-在拐角处  -失陪
<7-8,Raj>- Uh, it's in the corner. - Excuse me.

228
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,660
<7-9,Sheldon>你们好呀
<7-9,Sheldon>Hey, how you doin'?

229
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,410
<7-10,Raj>希望男女厕标识明显一点
<7-10,Raj>I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.

230
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,770
<7-11,Leonard>无所谓  反正他是往厨房方向走去了
<7-11,Leonard>Doesn't matter. He's headed for the kitchen anyway.

231
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,270
<7-12,Howard>这个主意也许行
<7-12,Howard>Maybe that's an idea--

232
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,620
<7-12,Howard>给醉酒人士的导向系统
<7-12,Howard>guidance systems for drunk people.

233
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,330
<7-13,Raj>早有了  叫优步叫车
<7-13,Raj>They have that. It's called Uber.

234
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,430
<7-14,Howard>在你的过冷氦试验中
<7-14,Howard>In your supercooled helium experiments,

235
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,810
<7-14,Howard>创建过量子漩涡吗
<7-14,Howard>did you create quantum vortices?

236
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,760
<7-15,Leonard>有  怎么了
<7-15,Leonard>Yeah. Why?

237
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,230
<7-16,Howard>如果你建立一个导向系统
<7-16,Howard>Well, if you made a guidance system,

238
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,060
<7-16,Howard>是不是可以把漩涡当做螺旋仪使用
<7-16,Howard>couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?

239
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,110
<7-17,Leonard>我从来没想过
<7-17,Leonard>I've never thought about that.

240
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,690
<7-18,Howard>而且由于是在量子态下
<7-18,Howard>And since it's in a quantum state,

241
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,640
<7-18,Howard>就能保持无限持续
<7-18,Howard>it would maintain an infinite persistence.

242
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,020
<7-19,Raj>开创性启示  热带鸡尾酒
<7-19,Raj>Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.

243
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,100
<7-19,Raj>这简直是最棒的一集
<7-19,Raj>Tell me this isn't like the

244
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,280
<7-19,Raj>《欲望都市》了
<7-19,Raj>best episode of Sex and the City.

245
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,090
<7-20,Leonard>你真有可能想出了好点子
<7-20,Leonard>You may have actually just come up with something.

246
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,330
<7-21,Howard>-你觉得是吗  -真的
<7-21,Howard>- You think so? - I really do.

247
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,350
<7-23,Sheldon>大伙  这里的厕所太妙了
<7-23,Sheldon>You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.

248
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,350
<7-23,Sheldon>里面有人在做饭呢
<7-23,Sheldon>There's people cooking in it.

249
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,350
<8-1,Amy>想想你有孩子后  有各种好玩的事可做
<8-1,Amy>Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.

250
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,920
<8-1,Amy>对呀
<8-1,Amy>Yeah!

251
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,020
<8-2,Penny>你可以买玩具和小衣服
<8-2,Penny>Yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.

252
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,920
<8-3,Bernadette>这些都给华仔做过了
<8-3,Bernadette>I kind of already do that for Howie.

253
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,320
<8-4,Penny>还有你只要饿了
<8-4,Penny>And-and whenever you're hungry,

254
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,570
<8-4,Penny>就会发现自己车上满地都有零食吃
<8-4,Penny>you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.

255
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,030
<8-5,Amy>我还给谢尔顿找到了个新旅行杯
<8-5,Amy>Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon.

256
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,340
<8-5,Amy>一次只会出三颗零食
<8-5,Amy>It only lets out three at a time.

257
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,850
<8-5,Amy>你们是什么时候决定要孩子的
<8-5,Amy>So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?

258
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,960
<8-6,Bernadette>我们不是决定的
<8-6,Bernadette>Well, we didn't exactly decide.

259
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,070
<8-6,Bernadette>我们聊过要孩子的事
<8-6,Bernadette>We were talking about it,

260
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,660
<8-6,Bernadette>然后有一天晚上就大胆疯了一下
<8-6,Bernadette>and then one night we got a little reckless.

261
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,040
<8-8,Amy>-给我们讲讲  -对  讲讲
<8-8,Amy>- Oh, tell us! - Yeah, tell us.

262
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,990
<8-9,Bernadette>不要啦  好丢脸哦
<8-9,Bernadette>No, I'm embarrassed.

263
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,180
<8-10,Penny>说吧  我们都是成人了
<8-10,Penny>Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups.

264
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,780
<8-11,Amy>-都有经验的  -我我我  有经验
<8-11,Amy>- We've all done it. - Me! Me-me, too!

265
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,690
<8-11,Amy>我是成人  做过了
<8-11,Amy>I'm a grown-up and I've done it!

266
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,960
<8-11,Amy>好吧
<8-11,Amy>Fine.

267
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,330
<8-12,Bernadette>那天我们在外面
<8-12,Bernadette>We were out one night,

268
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,510
<8-12,Bernadette>然后突然来了兴致
<8-12,Bernadette>and things got a little spontaneous.

269
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,300
<8-13,Amy>一听就知道内容很精彩
<8-13,Amy>Oh, that sounds juicy.

270
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,770
<8-14,Bernadette>当时谢尔顿没完没了地说时区和铁路安排
<8-14,Bernadette>Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones

271
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,200
<8-14,Bernadette>然后我就出去了...
<8-14,Bernadette>and railroad schedules, and I went out...

272
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,630
<8-15,Penny>等等  这事我记得  慢着
<8-15,Penny>Wait, I remember that. Hang on.

273
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,080
<8-15,Penny>你们是在我们家搞的吗
<8-15,Penny>You did it at our place?

274
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,080
<8-16,Bernadette>好像还是在谢尔顿床上
<8-16,Bernadette>Kind of on Sheldon's bed.

275
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,270
<8-18,Penny>-什么  -不
<8-18,Penny>- What?! - No!

276
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,450
<8-19,Bernadette>我想去厕所
<8-19,Bernadette>I was headed to the bathroom,

277
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,910
<8-19,Bernadette>碰到华仔从里面出来
<8-19,Bernadette>and I passed Howie on his way out.

278
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,160
<8-19,Bernadette>通常他会说"别进  进去会臭死"
<8-19,Bernadette>Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"

279
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,520
<8-19,Bernadette>但这次他说"我们进去吧"
<8-19,Bernadette>but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."

280
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,970
<8-20,Amy>你们怎么能这样
<8-20,Amy>How could you do that?

281
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,810
<8-20,Amy>对不起
<8-20,Amy>I'm sorry,

282
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,930
<8-21,Bernadette>但你也知道  跟自己的男人在一起
<8-21,Bernadette>but you know what it's like when you're with your man

283
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,880
<8-21,Bernadette>很容易情不自禁
<8-21,Bernadette>and one thing leads to another.

284
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,760
<8-22,Amy>这感觉姐知道  姐倍儿清楚
<8-22,Amy>I do know what that's like. I really do.

285
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,570
<9-1,Leonard>我没找到任何人
<9-1,Leonard>I'm not seeing anyone

286
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,710
<9-1,Leonard>是这样使用液态氦漩涡
<9-1,Leonard>using liquid helium vortices like this.

287
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,450
<9-2,Howard>我也没找到
<9-2,Howard>I'm not finding anything either.

288
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,770
<9-3,Raj>这是好事
<9-3,Raj>That's a good sign.

289
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,660
<9-4,Sheldon>等等  我找到点东西
<9-4,Sheldon>Oh, wait, I found something.

290
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,160
<9-5,Howard>该死  是什么
<9-5,Howard>Damn. What is it?

291
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,950
<9-6,Sheldon>这个视频  熊猫宝宝打喷嚏
<9-6,Sheldon>This video. The baby panda sneezes,

292
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,550
<9-6,Sheldon>把熊猫妈妈吓了一大跳
<9-6,Sheldon>and the mama panda gets so scared.

293
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,310
<9-7,Leonard>能不能不跑题聊正事
<9-7,Leonard>Can you focus on what we're talking about?

294
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,410
<9-7,Leonard>好吧
<9-7,Leonard>All right.

295
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,350
<9-8,Sheldon>听着  也许说的是酒话
<9-8,Sheldon>Look, now, this may be the rum talking,

296
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,380
<9-8,Sheldon>但如果漩涡释放率
<9-8,Sheldon>but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices

297
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,920
<9-8,Sheldon>能保持在1.1到1.3
<9-8,Sheldon>is kept within 1.1 and 1.3,

298
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,820
<9-8,Sheldon>马格努斯力的问题就可以忽略不计
<9-8,Sheldon>the Magnus force issue should be negligible.

299
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,260
<9-9,Raj>他喝醉都比我们仨更聪明
<9-9,Raj>Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.

300
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,500
<9-10,Sheldon>还更壮
<9-10,Sheldon>And stronger.

301
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,560
<9-10,Sheldon>谁想看我去痛扁酒保一顿
<9-10,Sheldon>Yeah. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?

302
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,070
<9-11,Leonard>我拭目以待
<9-11,Leonard>I'd enjoy that.

303
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,490
<9-12,Sheldon>放她一马吧  她是个好姑娘
<9-12,Sheldon>Nah, she's a good kid.

304
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,850
<9-13,Howard>如果真可行  我们可以去申请专利
<9-13,Howard>If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent

305
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,920
<9-13,Howard>然后授权给做导向系统的公司
<9-13,Howard>and license it to companies that make guidance systems.

306
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,690
<9-14,Raj>瞧  你知道要当爹的消息
<9-14,Raj>Look at that. You've known you're gonna be a father

307
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,110
<9-14,Raj>才不到一天你就已经雄起了
<9-14,Raj>for less than a day and you're already stepping up.

308
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,750
<9-15,Leonard>相信我  你绝对能行
<9-15,Leonard>I'm telling you, you got this.

309
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,970
<9-16,Howard>或许你说得对
<9-16,Howard>Maybe you're right.

310
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,550
<9-17,Sheldon>他当然对啦
<9-17,Sheldon>Of course he's right.

311
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,970
<9-17,Sheldon>你跟我最清楚小时候没爹疼有多惨
<9-17,Sheldon>You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.

312
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,720
<9-17,Sheldon>所以我十分确信
<9-17,Sheldon>That's why I'm confident you're gonna be

313
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,330
<9-17,Sheldon>你会尽力成为最好的爸爸
<9-17,Sheldon>the best dad you can be.

314
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,320
<9-18,Howard>谢谢你  谢尔顿
<9-18,Howard>Thank you, Sheldon.

315
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,670
<9-19,Sheldon>不客气
<9-19,Sheldon>You're welcome.

316
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,340
<9-19,Sheldon>如果是生了双胞胎
<9-19,Sheldon>And if he has twins, we can do

317
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,750
<9-19,Sheldon>我们就能拿来做好多屌爆的实验
<9-19,Sheldon>all kinds of neat experiments on them.

319
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,300
<10-1,Bernadette>你们想泡就泡吧
<10-1,Bernadette>You guys can go in if you want.

320
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,370
<10-2,Penny>我们要同进退
<10-2,Penny>No, we're a team.

321
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,020
<10-2,Penny>你不能泡  我们也不泡
<10-2,Penny>If you can't go in, we're not going in.

322
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,630
<10-3,Amy>那我们俩为什么还喝酒
<10-3,Amy>Then why are we drinking?

323
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,720
<10-4,Penny>她又不是怀上帝之子  不用这么牺牲吧
<10-4,Penny>Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?

324
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,030
<10-4,Penny>是莱纳德
<10-4,Penny>Oh. It's Leonard.

325
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,680
<10-4,Penny>他说谢尔顿喝醉了  还说如果有兴趣
<10-4,Penny>He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke

326
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,720
<10-4,Penny>欢迎加入他们唱卡拉ok
<10-4,Penny>if we want to join them.

327
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
<10-5,Bernadette>听起来挺有意思
<10-5,Bernadette>That sounds fun.

328
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,800
<10-5,Bernadette>惨了
<10-5,Bernadette>Oh, no.

329
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,600
<10-6,Amy>谢尔顿醉后乱发我短信了
<10-6,Amy>Sheldon's drunk texting me.

330
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,760
<10-7,Penny>写了什么
<10-7,Penny>What's it say?

331
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,360
<10-8,Amy>"要来跟我们一起唱歌吗"
<10-8,Amy>"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."

332
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,790
<10-9,Bernadette>这哪里算醉后乱发啊
<10-9,Bernadette>How is that a drunk text?

333
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,870
<10-10,Amy>问句他不用问号  而是句号
<10-10,Amy>He used a period instead of a question mark.

334
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,890
<10-10,Amy>他真是喝大了
<10-10,Amy>He's so wasted.
