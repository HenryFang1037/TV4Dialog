1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,300
<1-1,Sheldon>晚上好  路易吉披萨[意大利语]
<1-1,Sheldon>Buona sera, Luigi's Pizza.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,650
<1-1,Sheldon>晚上好[意大利语]
<1-1,Sheldon>Buona sera.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,940
<1-1,Sheldon>这是意大利语的"晚上好"
<1-1,Sheldon>It means good evening in Italian.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,170
<1-1,Sheldon>我想说  跟你解释这个问题
<1-1,Sheldon>May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,490
<1-1,Sheldon>让我对你们"餐厅"的正宗性产生了怀疑
<1-1,Sheldon>the authenticity of your ristorante?

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,550
<1-2,Leonard>我出去了
<1-2,Leonard>Okay, I'm out of here.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,800
<1-3,Sheldon>稍等[意大利语]
<1-3,Sheldon>Un momento.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,580
<1-3,Sheldon>我的老天爷呀
<1-3,Sheldon>Oh, for heaven's sake.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,390
<1-3,Sheldon>现在你是真心在装傻了吧
<1-3,Sheldon>Now you're being deliberately stupid.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,720
<1-3,Sheldon>你去哪儿
<1-3,Sheldon>Where are you going?

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,510
<1-4,Leonard>我要去拉杰那儿跟普丽娅共进晚餐
<1-4,Leonard>I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's.

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,460
<1-4,Leonard>我觉得霍华德也会去  你也来吗
<1-4,Leonard>I think Howard's going to be there. You want to join us?

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,810
<1-5,Sheldon>可今天是星期四啊
<1-5,Sheldon>But tonight's Thursday.

14
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,810
<1-5,Sheldon>每个星期四大家都会过来
<1-5,Sheldon>On Thursdays, everybody comes over here

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,900
<1-5,Sheldon>一起吃披萨
<1-5,Sheldon>and has pizza.

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,830
<1-5,Sheldon>或者是看菜单挺正宗
<1-5,Sheldon>Or a reasonable facsimile

17
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,960
<1-5,Sheldon>说是由某位叫路易吉做的
<1-5,Sheldon>prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi,

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,490
<1-5,Sheldon>可电话里的声音却听着山寨得像成龙
<1-5,Sheldon>but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,390
<1-6,Leonard>咱们今晚就不能破例一次吗
<1-6,Leonard>Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight?

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,440
<1-7,Sheldon>行啊
<1-7,Sheldon>We could.

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,080
<1-7,Sheldon>咱今晚也可以不用字母"M"
<1-7,Sheldon>We could also stop using the letter "M,"

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,230
<1-7,Sheldon>但我觉得这主意挺"呼导"[误导]挺"奥残"[脑残]的
<1-7,Sheldon>but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,920
<1-8,Leonard>跟我一起去拉杰家吧
<1-8,Leonard>Just come with me to Raj's.

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,570
<1-9,Sheldon>我不想参加派对
<1-9,Sheldon>Well, I don't want to go to a party.

25
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,440
<1-10,Leonard>不是派对  就是原来的一群
<1-10,Leonard>It's not a party. It's the same group of people

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,330
<1-10,Leonard>在这里聚的人今天去那里聚
<1-10,Leonard>who hang out here hanging out over there.

27
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,290
<1-11,Sheldon>不好意思  但是五个人一起吃饭聊天就是派对
<1-11,Sheldon>I'm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,870
<1-12,Leonard>那为啥在咱们这儿不算派对
<1-12,Leonard>How come it's not a party when we do it here?

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,620
<1-13,Sheldon>因为我们从来不办派对啊
<1-13,Sheldon>Because we don't throw parties.

30
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,760
<1-14,Leonard>我不知道该怎么跟你说了  谢尔顿
<1-14,Leonard>I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.

31
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,440
<1-14,Leonard>我要去见普丽娅  大家都去的
<1-14,Leonard>I'm going to see Priya. Everyone's over there.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,230
<1-14,Leonard>你来不来
<1-14,Leonard>You coming or not?

33
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,700
<1-14,Leonard>当然不去  知道为啥吗
<1-14,Leonard>Well, no, sir, and do you know why?

34
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,740
<1-15,Sheldon>一个词
<1-15,Sheldon>In a word:

35
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,930
<1-15,Sheldon>传统
<1-15,Sheldon>tradition.

36
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,020
<1-15,Sheldon>在过去这八年的每个周四晚上
<1-15,Sheldon>Every Thursday night for the last eight years,

37
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,720
<1-15,Sheldon>你和我还有我们的朋友们聚在这里
<1-15,Sheldon>you and I and our friends have gathered here

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,040
<1-15,Sheldon>就在这里切开覆盖着起司和酱料的面包[暗指披萨]
<1-15,Sheldon>in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce,

39
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,890
<1-15,Sheldon>讨论当日话题
<1-15,Sheldon>discuss the issues of the day,

40
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,170
<1-15,Sheldon>没错  还有分享欢乐
<1-15,Sheldon>and yes, share a laugh or two.

41
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,650
<1-15,Sheldon>但我猜这些宝贵的回忆对你来说一文不值
<1-15,Sheldon>But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.

42
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,710
<1-16,Leonard>你说的没错
<1-16,Leonard>I guess you're right.

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,730
<1-16,Leonard>-回见  -等等
<1-16,Leonard>- See you later. - Wait!

44
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,770
<1-17,Sheldon>莱纳德  等等
<1-17,Sheldon>Leonard! Wait!

45
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,270
<1-17,Sheldon>那我晚上吃啥啊
<1-17,Sheldon>What am I going to do for dinner?

46
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,290
<1-18,Leonard>跟我一起去拉杰家吃饭啊
<1-18,Leonard>Come with me to Raj's and eat there.

47
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,770
<1-19,Sheldon>我可不干
<1-19,Sheldon>I can't do that.

48
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,530
<1-19,Sheldon>万一他做了羊杂碎和黑香肠呢
<1-19,Sheldon>What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?

49
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,720
<1-20,Leonard>我对他会上这两道菜深表怀疑
<1-20,Leonard>I really doubt that's what he'll serve.

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,880
<1-21,Sheldon>万一他做了呢
<1-21,Sheldon>But what if he does?

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,420
<1-21,Sheldon>我就不得不
<1-21,Sheldon>I'll be obliged to dine

52
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,250
<1-21,Sheldon>吃包在羊肚里煮熟的肝和肺了
<1-21,Sheldon>on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep's stomach.

53
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,870
<1-21,Sheldon>说实在的  黑香肠差不多也是一样的
<1-21,Sheldon>And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing.

54
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,800
<1-21,Sheldon>我不知道他为啥整这俩菜
<1-21,Sheldon>I don't know why he's serving both.

55
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,110
<1-22,Leonard>你到底想干啥
<1-22,Leonard>What do you want to do?

56
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,150
<1-22,Leonard>是跟我一起去还是一个人待在家里
<1-22,Leonard>You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?

57
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,320
<1-23,Sheldon>算了  我还是去你的杂碎派对吧
<1-23,Sheldon>No, I'll go to your haggis party.

58
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,820
<1-23,Sheldon>但我得跟你说
<1-23,Sheldon>But I'm telling you.

59
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,290
<1-23,Sheldon>这太"轰狂"[疯狂]了  绝对是太"轰狂"[疯狂]了
<1-23,Sheldon>This is adness. This is utter and complete adness.

60
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,120
<1-23,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-23,Sheldon>第四季第十七集

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,240
<2-1,Sheldon>天啊
<2-1,Sheldon>Oh, dear!

62
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,600
<2-2,Leonard>-咋了  -拉杰的电视
<2-2,Leonard>- What? - Raj's television.

63
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,280
<2-3,Sheldon>我刚才意识到
<2-3,Sheldon>I just realized

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,980
<2-3,Sheldon>我们整晚都得看着
<2-3,Sheldon>we're about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen

65
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,230
<2-3,Sheldon>左上角还有一坨坏点的等离子电视
<2-3,Sheldon>with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.

66
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,330
<2-4,Leonard>那就别看电视了呗
<2-4,Leonard>So don't watch TV.

67
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,410
<2-4,Leonard>看书吧
<2-4,Leonard>Read a book.

68
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,760
<2-5,Sheldon>想显得不合群吗
<2-5,Sheldon>And be a social pariah?

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,570
<2-5,Sheldon>你知道那不是哥的风格
<2-5,Sheldon>Oh, you know that's not my style.

70
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,180
<2-7,Sheldon>你叹气是因为懊恼  对吧
<2-7,Sheldon>The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,440
<2-8,Leonard>对
<2-8,Leonard>Right.

72
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,960
<2-9,Sheldon>是因为我还是坏点
<2-9,Sheldon>Is it about me or the dead pixels?

73
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,770
<2-10,Raj>嗨  你俩来得正好
<2-10,Raj>Hey, you're just in time.

74
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,870
<2-10,Raj>我们做了德墨风味的小菜
<2-10,Raj>We made Tex-Mex.

75
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,870
<2-11,Leonard>听起来不错哦
<2-11,Leonard>Oh, sounds great.

76
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,250
<2-12,Sheldon>印度佬做德墨菜啊
<2-12,Sheldon>Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex.

77
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,200
<2-12,Sheldon>还不如吃中式披萨呢
<2-12,Sheldon>Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.

78
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,220
<2-13,Priya>你来啦
<2-13,Priya>Hey, you.

79
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,400
<2-14,Leonard>嗨
<2-14,Leonard>Hi.

80
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,190
<2-15,Howard>对你来说肯定很有意思  对吧
<2-15,Howard>That's got to be fun for you, huh?

81
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,780
<2-15,Howard>看着霍夫斯塔德在你妹妹嘴里
<2-15,Howard>Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva

82
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,520
<2-15,Howard>吮吸唾液
<2-15,Howard>out of your sister's mouth?

83
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,730
<2-16,Sheldon>不好意思  在今晚开始之前
<2-16,Sheldon>Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further,

84
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,340
<2-16,Sheldon>我们得先定好谁坐在哪儿
<2-16,Sheldon>we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.

85
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,180
<2-17,Priya>又没有人预定座位  谢尔顿
<2-17,Priya>There is no assigned seats, Sheldon.

86
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,040
<2-17,Priya>随便找个地儿坐呗  别太拘束哈
<2-17,Priya>Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.

87
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,940
<2-18,Sheldon>真有意思
<2-18,Sheldon>Oh, what fun.

88
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,210
<2-18,Sheldon>我们就像是友爱集会里的嬉皮士
<2-18,Sheldon>We're like hippies at a love-in.

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,670
<2-19,Leonard>就坐这儿吧
<2-19,Leonard>Just sit here.

90
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,250
<2-20,Sheldon>马上  哥们儿  马上
<2-20,Sheldon>Right on, man. Right on.

91
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,890
<2-20,Sheldon>看呐
<2-20,Sheldon>Oh, look.

92
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,980
<2-20,Sheldon>这不是哈利波特和百分之九十八的魔法石吗
<2-20,Sheldon>it's Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer's Stone.

93
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,630
<2-21,Raj>好咯  这里有玉米卷饼
<2-21,Raj>Okay, we've got fajitas

94
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,150
<2-21,Raj>和各种配菜  你们自便吧
<2-21,Raj>with all the fixins, so you make your own.

95
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,280
<2-22,Sheldon>好极了
<2-22,Sheldon>Wonderful.

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,440
<2-22,Sheldon>晚饭  还得要自己动手的
<2-22,Sheldon>Dinner, some assembly required.

97
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,880
<2-23,Priya>想来一杯玛格丽特吗  谢尔顿
<2-23,Priya>Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?

98
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,610
<2-23,Priya>玛格丽特
<2-23,Priya>A margarita?!

99
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,540
<2-24,Sheldon>我们这是在哪儿啊  出什么事儿了
<2-24,Sheldon>Where are we?! What is happening?!

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,470
<3-1,Penny>嗨  谢尔顿
<3-1,Penny>Oh. Hey, Sheldon.

101
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,670
<3-1,Penny>想来点儿啥
<3-1,Penny>What can I get you?

102
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,580
<3-2,Sheldon>水  纯水
<3-2,Sheldon>Water. Neat.

103
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,150
<3-2,Sheldon>再放一把小伞
<3-2,Sheldon>With a little umbrella.

104
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,800
<3-3,Penny>你的朋友们在哪儿呢
<3-3,Penny>Where are all your friends?

105
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,090
<3-4,Sheldon>可悲啊  佩妮  今晚  我就是黑暗骑士[蝙蝠侠]
<3-4,Sheldon>Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight,

106
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,790
<3-4,Sheldon>独自漫步在破旧的大街上
<3-4,Sheldon>roaming these mean streets alone.

107
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,920
<3-4,Sheldon>一件斗篷风衣披肩
<3-4,Sheldon>A windbreaker for my cape,

108
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,510
<3-4,Sheldon>帽檐下是冷峻的面庞
<3-4,Sheldon>and a stern expression for my cowl.

109
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,470
<3-5,Penny>好吧
<3-5,Penny>Okay.

110
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,010
<3-5,Penny>劳驾
<3-5,Penny>Excuse me?

111
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,740
<3-6,Sheldon>难道现在不是应该有一位厌世的酒保
<3-6,Sheldon>Isn't this the point where the world-weary barkeep

112
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,630
<3-6,Sheldon>心不在焉地一边擦柜台
<3-6,Sheldon>absentmindedly wipes down the bar

113
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,870
<3-6,Sheldon>一遍抚慰客人心中的忧愁吗
<3-6,Sheldon>and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?

114
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,750
<3-7,Penny>我只是要帮你拿那个该死的小伞  不过好吧
<3-7,Penny>Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right.

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,780
<3-7,Penny>有什么烦心事啊  伙计
<3-7,Penny>What's troubling you, buddy?

116
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,810
<3-8,Sheldon>我知道你是装出来的  不过既然你问了
<3-8,Sheldon>I don't think your heart's in it, but since you asked...

117
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,090
<3-8,Sheldon>显然  因为莱纳德在和拉杰的妹妹约会
<3-8,Sheldon>Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj's sister,

118
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,710
<3-8,Sheldon>我们都被迫去拉杰家里聚会
<3-8,Sheldon>we're all forced to hang out at his apartment.

119
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,320
<3-9,Penny>哦  真糟糕
<3-9,Penny>Oh, the horror.

120
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,620
<3-10,Sheldon>没错
<3-10,Sheldon>Indeed.

121
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,290
<3-10,Sheldon>而且啊  拉杰在放雷鬼音乐[源自牙买加]
<3-10,Sheldon>Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music,

122
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,860
<3-10,Sheldon>他妹妹还把鞋给脱了
<3-10,Sheldon>and his sister took off her shoes.

123
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,470
<3-10,Sheldon>简直就是卡里古拉大帝的晚年时期
<3-10,Sheldon>It was like the last days of Caligula.

125
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,490
<3-10,Sheldon>这个我得接
<3-10,Sheldon>Oh, I have to get this.

126
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,570
<3-11,Penny>伞呢
<3-11,Penny>Umbrella?

127
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,500
<3-12,Sheldon>真不知道她有啥好恼的
<3-12,Sheldon>Wonder what she's exasperated about.

128
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,010
<3-12,Sheldon>嗨
<3-12,Sheldon>Hello?

129
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,500
<3-13,Amy (on phone)>谢尔顿  你还好吧
<3-13,Amy (on phone)>Sheldon, are you all right?

130
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,810
<3-13,Amy (on phone)>我们上次通话的时候  你正准备
<3-13,Amy (on phone)>When last we spoke, you were going to

131
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,440
<3-13,Amy (on phone)>打车离开拉杰家  但是根据Facebook
<3-13,Amy (on phone)>take a taxi home from Raj's, but according to Facebook,

132
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,280
<3-13,Amy (on phone)>你刚才进蛋糕工厂了
<3-13,Amy (on phone)>you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.

133
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,130
<3-14,Sheldon>对  我之前是在打车来着
<3-14,Sheldon>Yes, I was in a taxi,

134
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,230
<3-14,Sheldon>但是司机和他运营执照上的照片
<3-14,Sheldon>but the driver didn't look at all

135
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,030
<3-14,Sheldon>长得一点都不像
<3-14,Sheldon>like the photograph on his license,

136
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,020
<3-14,Sheldon>所以我就跳下车跑过来了
<3-14,Sheldon>so I leapt out and ran for it.

137
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,310
<3-15,Amy>明智
<3-15,Amy>Wise.

138
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,450
<3-16,Penny>给你
<3-16,Penny>There you go.

139
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,290
<3-16,Penny>就像是加勒比海边的元气恢复酒一样
<3-16,Penny>Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.

140
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,780
<3-17,Amy>嗨  闺蜜
<3-17,Amy>Hi, bestie.

141
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,230
<3-18,Penny>哦嗨  艾米
<3-18,Penny>Oh. Hi, Amy.

142
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,040
<3-18,Penny>最近还好吗
<3-18,Penny>How you been?

143
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,360
<3-19,Amy>很好
<3-19,Amy>Fine.

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,870
<3-19,Amy>从这个角度  我能看到你的鼻孔
<3-19,Amy>From this angle, I can see up your nose.

145
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,980
<3-20,Penny>是啊  活在高科技时代挺好的  对吧
<3-20,Penny>Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?

146
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,060
<3-21,Sheldon>没关系  我的问题可以待会儿再说
<3-21,Sheldon>Don't worry. My problems can wait

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,390
<3-21,Sheldon>你们两个女人接着八卦吧
<3-21,Sheldon>while you two hens finish your clucking.

148
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,480
<3-22,Penny>听着  谢尔顿  莱纳德在和普丽娅约会
<3-22,Penny>Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya.

149
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
<3-22,Penny>她住在拉杰那儿
<3-22,Penny>She is staying with Raj.

150
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,810
<3-22,Penny>这就意味着你们以后很可能会经常去那儿
<3-22,Penny>That means you're all probably gonna be hanging out there more.

151
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,380
<3-23,Amy>佩妮  很抱歉把你也牵扯进来
<3-23,Amy>Penny, I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

152
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,500
<3-23,Amy>我知道你伤心欲绝
<3-23,Amy>I know you're devastated

153
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,650
<3-23,Amy>你的前男友找到了一位惊艳的新欢
<3-23,Amy>that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover

154
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,960
<3-23,Amy>而且她的小麦色皮肤美丽无瑕
<3-23,Amy>with flawless, caramel-colored skin.

155
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,670
<3-24,Penny>我对莱纳德和普丽娅的事儿没啥郁闷的
<3-24,Penny>Okay, I'm not upset about Leonard and Priya.

156
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,340
<3-25,Amy>但你扇动的鼻翼可不是这个意思
<3-25,Amy>Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.

157
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,850
<3-26,Sheldon>继续八吧八吧
<3-26,Sheldon>Cluck-cluck-cluck.

158
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,770
<3-27,Amy>谢尔顿  看着我
<3-27,Amy>Sheldon, look at me.

159
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,960
<3-27,Amy>我觉得是时候
<3-27,Amy>I think it's time

160
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,820
<3-27,Amy>面对这一现实了
<3-27,Amy>to face the fact

161
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,080
<3-27,Amy>莱纳德就是你们这个小团体的中心
<3-27,Amy>that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group.

162
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
<3-27,Amy>他去哪儿  你们就去哪儿
<3-27,Amy>Where he goes, the group goes.

163
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,390
<3-28,Sheldon>莱纳德是中心
<3-28,Sheldon>Leonard the nucleus?

164
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,950
<3-28,Sheldon>这没道理啊
<3-28,Sheldon>That makes no sense.

165
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,400
<3-28,Sheldon>我才是异想天开的精灵
<3-28,Sheldon>I'm the whimsical elf

166
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,500
<3-28,Sheldon>让大家欢乐相聚
<3-28,Sheldon>that everyone looks to for a good time.

167
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,840
<3-29,Amy>我不是说你很无聊
<3-29,Amy>I'm not saying that you're not fun.

168
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,300
<3-29,Amy>你是我认识的最有趣的人
<3-29,Amy>You're the most fun person I know.

169
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,510
<3-30,Penny>很多人觉得跟我一起很有趣
<3-30,Penny>A lot of people think I'm fun to be around.

170
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,640
<3-31,Amy>别耍宝了  闺蜜
<3-31,Amy>Don't be needy, bestie.

171
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,410
<3-31,Amy>也许正是因此莱纳德离开了你
<3-31,Amy>That's probably part of what chased Leonard away.

172
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,750
<3-31,Amy>我的意思是  谢尔顿
<3-31,Amy>What I am saying, Sheldon,

173
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,000
<3-31,Amy>你们那群人是以莱纳德为中心的
<3-31,Amy>is that your group is Leonard-centric.

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,530
<3-31,Amy>要是个小镇  就会是莱纳德镇
<3-31,Amy>If it were a town, it would be Leonardville.

175
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,360
<3-31,Amy>要是个伊斯兰国家  莱纳德斯坦
<3-31,Amy>If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan.

176
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,420
<3-31,Amy>要是电影的诞生地
<3-31,Amy>If it were the birthplace of motion pictures,

177
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,010
<3-31,Amy>大家都会唱着"莱纳坞精神万岁"
<3-31,Amy>we'd all be singing "Hooray for Leonardwood."

178
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,460
<3-32,Penny>我想到一个
<3-32,Penny>Ooh, I got one.

179
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,600
<3-32,Penny>如果你们是支乐队
<3-32,Penny>If you guys were a band,

180
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,160
<3-32,Penny>就会是莱纳德和他朋友们
<3-32,Penny>you'd be called Leonard and the Leonards.

181
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,050
<3-33,Amy>太耍宝了
<3-33,Amy>So needy.

182
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,300
<4-1,Leonard>你在做什么
<4-1,Leonard>What you doing?

183
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,430
<4-2,Sheldon>拿点小吃出来
<4-2,Sheldon>I'm setting out snacks.

184
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,180
<4-3,Leonard>今晚我们都要去拉杰家你知道的吧
<4-3,Leonard>You do realize everyone's eating at Raj's again tonight.

186
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,070
<4-4,Sheldon>这小吃又不是给你的  诺丝·罗茜
<4-4,Sheldon>I didn't say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?

187
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,330
<4-5,Leonard>有人要来吗
<4-5,Leonard>You're having people over?

188
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,240
<4-6,Sheldon>对  你一定好奇死了谁会来
<4-6,Sheldon>Yes. Must be killing you wondering who.

189
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,720
<4-6,Sheldon>好吧  我告诉你

<4-7,Leonard>勒瓦尔·布尔顿也要来吗
<4-7,Leonard>LeVar Burton's coming here?

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,790
<5-6,Barry>是因为你说今晚会有"凑奖"
<5-6,Barry>because you told me there was going to be a whaffle.

240
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,650
<5-6,Barry>凑奖什么时候开始
<5-6,Barry>When is the whaffle?

241
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,230
<5-7,Sheldon>淡定  淡定  巴里
<5-7,Sheldon>Patience, patience, Barry.

242
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,130
<5-7,Sheldon>凑奖...
<5-7,Sheldon>The whaffle...

243
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,680
<5-7,Sheldon>抽奖是持续整晚
<5-7,Sheldon>The raffle is the grand finale

244
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,390
<5-7,Sheldon>玩乐放荡的压轴大戏
<5-7,Sheldon>to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.

245
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,960
<5-9,Sheldon>-还有个问题  -对  你一定会抽得到
<5-9,Sheldon>- One more question... - Yes, you must be present to win.

246
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,600
<5-10,Zack>好了  我准备好了
<5-10,Zack>Okay, I'm ready.

247
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,460
<5-10,Zack>我是扎克  我呃...
<5-10,Zack>I'm Zach, and I'm, uh...

248
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,470
<5-10,Zack>讨厌  为什么这么难
<5-10,Zack>Oh, crap, why is this so hard?

249
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,110
<6-1,Penny>嗨
<6-1,Penny>Oh, hey.

250
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,880
<6-3,Amy>-嗨  -好啊  宅女
<6-3,Amy>- Hi. - Yo, P-dog.

251
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,860
<6-4,Penny>有事吗
<6-4,Penny>What's up?

252
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,410
<6-5,Bernadette>我们来绑架你出去过女生之夜
<6-5,Bernadette>We're here to kidnap you for a girls' night out.

253
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,170
<6-6,Amy>说明一下  所谓"绑架"是开玩笑的
<6-6,Amy>Parenthetical: the term "Kidnap" is being used playfully.

254
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,150
<6-7,Penny>我知道的
<6-7,Penny>I kind of figured that.

255
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,800
<6-8,Amy>很好  那就把这枕头套套上去
<6-8,Amy>Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.

256
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,930
<6-9,Penny>不要
<6-9,Penny>No.

257
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,950
<6-10,Amy>她以前比这有趣多了
<6-10,Amy>She used to be much more fun,

258
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,900
<6-10,Amy>直到莱纳德狠狠伤了她的心
<6-10,Amy>until Leonard punched her in the heart.

259
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,820
<6-11,Bernadette>我们认为你应该想出去
<6-11,Bernadette>We just thought you might want to go out

260
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,230
<6-11,Bernadette>好好玩一下  或者去跳跳舞
<6-11,Bernadette>and have a good time, maybe go dancing.

261
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,870
<6-12,Penny>天  谢谢  可我现在没心情
<6-12,Penny>Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.

262
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,650
<6-13,Amy>你要知道  沉醉到其他各种
<6-13,Amy>You do understand that it will distract you

263
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,910
<6-13,Amy>甜蜜可爱事情上  能让你不去注意
<6-13,Amy>from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving

264
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,730
<6-13,Amy>你的前男友
<6-13,Amy>that your ex-boyfriend

265
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,770
<6-13,Amy>正得到孟买火热宝贝的青睐
<6-13,Amy>is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.

266
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,400
<6-14,Penny>好吧
<6-14,Penny>Okay, look,

267
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,730
<6-14,Penny>我要是同意跟你们出去玩
<6-14,Penny>if I agree to go out with you guys,

268
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,240
<6-14,Penny>你们要保证不拿莱纳德和普丽娅的事烦我
<6-14,Penny>will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?

269
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,550
<6-16,Bernadette>-好的  -当然
<6-16,Bernadette>- Yes. - Sure.

270
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,390
<6-17,Penny>好吧  我去换衣服  进来吧
<6-17,Penny>All right. I'll go change. Come on in.

271
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,460
<6-18,Amy>你要是让我带了哥罗芳[迷药]
<6-18,Amy>If you'd have let me bring the chloroform,

272
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,730
<6-18,Amy>我们就不必说刚才那么多废话了
<6-18,Amy>we wouldn't have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.

273
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,050
<7-1,Zack>总之  我们滑雪滑累了之后
<7-1,Zack>Anyway, after we get done snowboarding,

274
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,270
<7-1,Zack>我就回旅馆  泡极可意按摩浴缸了
<7-1,Zack>I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi.

275
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,580
<7-1,Zack>周围没有人  所以我自然就让蛋蛋出来呼吸了
<7-1,Zack>There's no one around, so naturally, I'm free-balling it.

276
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,010
<7-1,Zack>然后
<7-1,Zack>Next thing I know,

277
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,420
<7-1,Zack>有位美女突然出现
<7-1,Zack>this beautiful chick shows up,

278
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,750
<7-1,Zack>喝得醉醺醺地  想跟我共浴
<7-1,Zack>drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.

279
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,770
<7-1,Zack>提问
<7-1,Zack>Question.

280
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,860
<7-2,Sheldon>那是极可意浴缸还是热水浴缸
<7-2,Sheldon>Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

281
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,760
<7-3,Barry>你坑爹呢?  就想问这个?!
<7-3,Barry>Really? That's your question?

282
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,770
<7-4,Zack>有什么区别
<7-4,Zack>What's the difference?

283
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,680
<7-5,Sheldon>极可意浴缸是种商业品牌
<7-5,Sheldon>"Jacuzzi" is a commercial brand.

284
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,640
<7-5,Sheldon>热水浴缸是通用术语
<7-5,Sheldon>"Hot tub" is the generic term.

285
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,710
<7-5,Sheldon>就是说  所有极可意都是热水浴缸
<7-5,Sheldon>I.E., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs,

286
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,580
<7-5,Sheldon>但并非所有热水浴缸都是极可意
<7-5,Sheldon>but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.

287
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,160
<7-6,Zack>是不是就像所有拇指都是手指
<7-6,Zack>Is that like all thumbs are fingers,

288
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,610
<7-6,Zack>但并非所有手指都是拇指
<7-6,Zack>but not all fingers are thumbs?

289
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,310
<7-7,Sheldon>没想到啊  是的
<7-7,Sheldon>Surprisingly, yes.

290
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,390
<7-7,Sheldon>很好
<7-7,Sheldon>Nice.

291
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,280
<7-8,Zack>那脚趾到底是什么
<7-8,Zack>Now, what exactly are toes?

292
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,760
<7-9,Stuart>能否跳回去继续说那醉妞
<7-9,Stuart>Can you please get back to the drunk girl?

293
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,140
<7-9,Stuart>我洗澡的时候需要点想象的灵感啊
<7-9,Stuart>I'd like something to think about in the shower.

294
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,730
<7-9,Stuart>对了
<7-9,Stuart>Oh, yeah.

295
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,830
<7-10,Zack>总之  她也脱光光了
<7-10,Zack>Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes,

296
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,250
<7-10,Zack>爬进了热水浴缸  我首先注意到的是...
<7-10,Zack>climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice...

297
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,270
<7-11,Sheldon>水面上升了
<7-11,Sheldon>The water level rose.

298
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,900
<7-12,Zack>不是
<7-12,Zack>No.

299
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,830
<7-13,Sheldon>水位当然要上升
<7-13,Sheldon>Of course it did.

300
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,560
<7-13,Sheldon>据说阿基米德
<7-13,Sheldon>It's said that Archimedes,

301
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,140
<7-13,Sheldon>古希腊数学家
<7-13,Sheldon>the ancient Greek mathematician,

302
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,150
<7-13,Sheldon>就是泡澡时发现了浮力定律
<7-13,Sheldon>discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.

303
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,190
<7-14,Barry>太棒了  继续说  扎克
<7-14,Barry>Terrific. Go ahead, Zack.

304
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,560
<7-14,Barry>光光的醉妞  光光的蛋蛋  继续
<7-14,Barry>Naked drunk girl, free-balling, continue.

305
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,700
<7-15,Sheldon>抱歉  但我觉得你们会发现
<7-15,Sheldon>Forgive me, but I think you'll find

306
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,610
<7-15,Sheldon>我的故事更有趣
<7-15,Sheldon>my story is more interesting.

307
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,060
<7-16,Barry>你的故事里也有沾露娇乳吗
<7-16,Barry>Does yours have wet breasts in it?

308
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,180
<7-16,Barry>比这更好
<7-16,Barry>Better.

309
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,750
<7-17,Sheldon>里面有个金冠
<7-17,Sheldon>It has a gold crown.

310
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,570
<7-17,Sheldon>国王想知道金冠中有多少黄金
<7-17,Sheldon>You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it

311
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,130
<7-17,Sheldon>让阿基米德想个办法测出来
<7-17,Sheldon>and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution.

312
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,300
<7-17,Sheldon>因为金冠形状不规则
<7-17,Sheldon>Because the crown was irregularly shaped,

313
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,570
<7-17,Sheldon>无法用数学计算出体积
<7-17,Sheldon>there was no way to mathematically determine its volume.

314
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,470
<7-17,Sheldon>但在泡澡时  阿基米德突然想到
<7-17,Sheldon>But, while bathing, Archimedes realized

315
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,140
<7-17,Sheldon>可以把金冠浸入水中
<7-17,Sheldon>he could immerse the crown

316
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,200
<7-17,Sheldon>量出水面上升的数值以计算体积
<7-17,Sheldon>and measure the amount the water rose.

317
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,050
<7-18,Zack>长话短说  我上了她
<7-18,Zack>So, long story short, I nailed her.

318
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,950
<7-19,Sheldon>想出来后  他高叫着"我找到了"[希腊语]
<7-19,Sheldon>When he finished, he shouted "Eureka!"

319
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,150
<7-20,Zack>不  我总是叫"天哪"
<7-20,Zack>No, I always shout, "Holy moly!"

320
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,720
<7-20,Zack>不知道为什么  反正就这么叫
<7-20,Zack>Don't know why. Just do.

321
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,700
<7-20,Zack>好吧
<7-20,Zack>All right,

322
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,500
<7-21,Sheldon>今晚的"让我们了解你"部分到此为止
<7-21,Sheldon>that concludes the "Getting to know you" Portion of the evening.

323
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,400
<7-21,Sheldon>谁想来玩些复古游戏
<7-21,Sheldon>Who's ready to play some vintage video games?

324
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,340
<7-21,Sheldon>今晚的选择包括
<7-21,Sheldon>And tonight's selections include

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,670
<7-21,Sheldon>"索克"
<7-21,Sheldon>"Zork."

329
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,730
<7-21,Sheldon>选我选我  我可好玩啦
<7-21,Sheldon>Pick me, pick me. I'm fun.

330
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,930
<7-22,Barry>里面那个长毛大肉球可恶心了
<7-22,Barry>That all sucks the big hairy meatball.

331
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,740
<7-22,Barry>我去把我车上的卡拉OK机拿出来
<7-22,Barry>How about I go get the karaoke machine out of my car,

332
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,260
<7-22,Barry>喝个酩酊大醉  然后把放声高歌把屋顶掀飞  怎么样
<7-22,Barry>get plastered and blow the roof off this place?

333
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,020
<7-23,Zack>很好  我负责买啤酒
<7-23,Zack>Great, I'll make a beer run.

334
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,580
<7-24,Stuart>那我负责去洗澡
<7-24,Stuart>And I'll take a shower.

<7-25,Barry>就这么定了
<7-25,Barry>Check.

337
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,420
<7-26,Sheldon>我负责不高兴
<7-26,Sheldon>I'm unhappy.

338
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,930
<8-1,Leonard>真好吃
<8-1,Leonard>This is delicious.

339
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,690
<8-1,Leonard>你这辣椒汤在哪儿学的
<8-1,Leonard>Where'd you learn to make chili?

340
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,640
<8-2,Priya>我在英国读大学的时候
<8-2,Priya>When I was at university in England,

341
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,050
<8-2,Priya>我室友是得克萨斯州人
<8-2,Priya>my flatmate was from Texas.

342
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,270
<8-3,Leonard>希望她不跟我那位得克萨斯室友一样
<8-3,Leonard>I hope she wasn't anything like my flatmate from Texas.

343
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,930
<8-4,Priya>谢尔顿有点古怪  对吧
<8-4,Priya>Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn't he?

344
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,960
<8-5,Howard>拜托  回顾那个混蛋疯子的人生
<8-5,Howard>Oh, please. That crazy bastard's looking

345
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,580
<8-5,Howard>全都是古怪这个词儿呢
<8-5,Howard>at quirky in the rearview mirror.

346
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,310
<8-6,Leonard>你们知道吗  我们的室友协议里面规定
<8-6,Leonard>Did you know that, per our roommate agreement,

347
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,190
<8-6,Leonard>我必须在洗澡前先把脚洗干净
<8-6,Leonard>I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower?

348
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,380
<8-6,Leonard>而且还不能在水池子里洗
<8-6,Leonard>And not in the sink.

349
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,590
<8-6,Leonard>所以我们各有一个特制的小桶
<8-6,Leonard>We each have special buckets.

350
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,350
<8-7,Howard>拉杰  你有告诉过你妹妹
<8-7,Howard>Raj, did you ever tell your sister

351
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,330
<8-7,Howard>谢尔顿曾被比尔·盖茨扁过吗
<8-7,Howard>about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?

352
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,080
<8-8,Priya>-天啊  你开玩笑呢吧  -真的
<8-8,Priya>- Oh, God, you're kidding. - Nope.

353
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,770
<8-9,Raj>盖茨来大学里演讲
<8-9,Raj>Gates gave a speech at the university.

354
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,510
<8-9,Raj>结束后  谢尔顿走过去跟他说
<8-9,Raj>Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said,

355
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,810
<8-9,Raj>"如果你不是为非洲的病童
<8-9,Raj>"Maybe if you weren't so distracted

356
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,430
<8-9,Raj>那么劳神的话
<8-9,Raj>by sick children in Africa,

357
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,490
<8-9,Raj>或许你能有多一点想法  好好弄弄Windows Vista"
<8-9,Raj>you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista."

358
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,110
<8-10,Leonard>砰  正中鼻头
<8-10,Leonard>Bam. Right in the nose.

359
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,920
<8-10,Leonard>顿时让我觉得  拥有一台电脑是多么骄傲的事情
<8-10,Leonard>Made me proud to own a PC.

360
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,580
<8-10,Leonard>我提议为今晚举杯欢庆
<8-10,Leonard>I'd like to propose a toast

361
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,650
<8-11,Raj>为这完全摆脱谢尔顿的珍贵而美妙的夜晚
<8-11,Raj>to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.

362
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,170
<8-12,Leonard>-说得对  -干杯
<8-12,Leonard>- Hear, hear. - Cheers.

363
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,540
<8-13,Howard>你们发现这是破天荒头一遭  我们举杯欢庆
<8-13,Howard>You realize that's the first time we've ever done that

364
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,150
<8-13,Howard>而不被谢尔顿强迫科普
<8-13,Howard>without having to listen to Sheldon tell us

365
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,700
<8-14,Priya>何为祝酒吗
<8-14,Priya>why it's called a toast?

366
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,310
<8-14,Priya>那何为祝酒
<8-14,Priya>Why is it called a toast?

367
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,560
<8-15,Leonard>古罗马人
<8-15,Leonard>Oh, the ancient Romans

368
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,320
<8-15,Leonard>把香喷喷的面包片放到他们的酒碗里
<8-15,Leonard>put spiced toast in their punch bowls.

369
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,040
<8-16,Raj>谢尔顿解释得更好
<8-16,Raj>Sheldon tells it better.

370
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,660
<8-17,Leonard>-好像是  -的确是
<8-17,Leonard>- He kind of does. - Yeah.

371
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,030
<8-19,Leonard>该死的  我想他了
<8-19,Leonard>Aw, hell, I miss him.

372
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,630
<9-1,Penny>那你们想去哪里跳舞
<9-1,Penny>So, where do you guys want to go dancing?

373
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,630
<9-2,Bernadette>我们希望你会知道个好地方
<9-2,Bernadette>We were hoping you'd know a place.

374
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,440
<9-3,Amy>对  或许那里上演着
<9-3,Amy>Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly

375
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,950
<9-3,Amy>一场超棒的肉体狂欢会
<9-3,Amy>with young, beautiful bodies

376
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,460
<9-3,Amy>紧身的衣服藏不住年轻美丽的躯体
<9-3,Amy>sweating and writhing against each other

377
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,690
<9-3,Amy>大家挥洒着汗水  相互扭成一团
<9-3,Amy>in a glorious orgy of the flesh.

378
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,260
<9-4,Penny>没错  我是知道这么个地方
<9-4,Penny>Oh, yeah, I know that place.

379
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,240
<9-4,Penny>这身怎么样
<9-4,Penny>What do you think?

380
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,700
<9-5,Amy>应该能充分展示你的胸襟
<9-5,Amy>That should display enough of your bosom

381
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,480
<9-5,Amy>好吸引一个新男友  或是一个饥饿的婴儿
<9-5,Amy>to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.

382
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,250
<9-6,Penny>够了  我再跟你们重申一次
<9-6,Penny>Okay, let's go through this one more time.

383
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,740
<9-6,Penny>只因莱纳德有了新女友
<9-6,Penny>Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend

384
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,520
<9-6,Penny>并不意味着我要出去勾引一个新男友
<9-6,Penny>does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.

385
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,570
<9-7,Bernadette>但如果你想你就可以  不是吗
<9-7,Bernadette>But you could if you wanted to, right?

386
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,260
<9-8,Penny>话是这么说  没错
<9-8,Penny>Well, yeah, I guess.

387
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,760
<9-9,Bernadette>从房间里挑选出一位最辣的猛男
<9-9,Bernadette>Pick out the hottest guy in the room,

388
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,120
<9-9,Bernadette>把他带回家  跟他做一些不能说的秘密
<9-9,Bernadette>take him home, do unspeakable things to him,

389
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,330
<9-9,Bernadette>然后让他面带微笑  臀带牙印
<9-9,Bernadette>then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face

390
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,800
<9-9,Bernadette>滚到路边
<9-9,Bernadette>and teeth marks on his heinie?

391
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,390
<9-10,Penny>差不多吧
<9-10,Penny>More or less.

392
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,930
<9-11,Amy>那是种怎样的滋味呀
<9-11,Amy>What's that like?

393
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,680
<9-11,Amy>我也说不清
<9-11,Amy>I don't know.

394
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,970
<9-12,Penny>当你做的时候  乐在其中
<9-12,Penny>It's fun while you're doing it.

395
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,400
<9-12,Penny>但过后  大多时候会尴尬
<9-12,Penny>And then after, it's mostly embarrassment,

396
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,920
<9-12,Penny>自我厌恶和后悔
<9-12,Penny>self-loathing and regret.

397
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,880
<9-13,Bernadette>我愿意整天都享受这种滋味
<9-13,Bernadette>I would take that deal all day long.

398
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,370
<9-14,Penny>好吧  但今晚不会发生这种事
<9-14,Penny>Yeah, well, it's not gonna happen tonight.

399
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,830
<9-14,Penny>这是我人生中第一次
<9-14,Penny>You know, for the first time in my life,

400
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,430
<9-14,Penny>不谈恋爱
<9-14,Penny>I am not in a relationship,

401
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,060
<9-14,Penny>我也完全觉得没有关系
<9-14,Penny>and I'm totally okay with it.

402
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,370
<9-15,Amy>如果独自一人对你来说很新鲜
<9-15,Amy>You know, if being on your own is new to you,

403
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,060
<9-15,Amy>我很乐意跟你分享一些  我这么多年来爱用的
<9-15,Amy>I'd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques

404
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,760
<9-15,Amy>解除空窗期紧张的女士专用科技产品
<9-15,Amy>for ladies I've perfected over the years.

405
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,280
<9-15,Amy>比如  你有电动牙刷吗
<9-15,Amy>For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?

406
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,170
<9-16,Penny>没有
<9-16,Penny>Um, no.

407
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,940
<9-17,Amy>那你应该买一个
<9-17,Amy>You should get one.

408
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,180
<9-18,Bernadette>那是什么
<9-18,Bernadette>What's that?

409
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,950
<9-19,Amy>好像是保存的某些东西
<9-19,Amy>It appears to be something preserved

410
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,010
<9-19,Amy>夹在两片丙烯酸树脂之间
<9-19,Amy>between two pieces of acrylic.

411
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,920
<9-20,Penny>那是来自北极的雪花片
<9-20,Penny>Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole.

412
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,100
<9-20,Penny>莱纳德去年给我的
<9-20,Penny>Leonard gave it to me last year.

413
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,610
<9-21,Bernadette>天啊  真浪漫
<9-21,Bernadette>Oh, God, that is so romantic.

414
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,360
<9-22,Penny>是呀  曾经是
<9-22,Penny>Yeah, it was.

415
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,960
<9-23,Bernadette>莱纳德真是独一无二的情种
<9-23,Bernadette>Leonard's really one of a kind.

416
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,500
<9-24,Amy>一边拿着雪花一边说这话
<9-24,Amy>Saying that while holding a snowflake

417
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,850
<9-24,Amy>不觉得手上的东西有点儿沉么
<9-24,Amy>is a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?

418
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,820
<9-25,Penny>让我看看
<9-25,Penny>Let me see that.

419
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,230
<9-25,Penny>去它的破雪花
<9-25,Penny>Oh, screw it.

420
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,610
<9-25,Penny>一点半点的自我厌恶  姐还是能处理的
<9-25,Penny>I can deal with a little self-loathing.

421
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,900
<9-25,Penny>走吧  找个小翘臀让姐咬一口
<9-25,Penny>Let's go find me a heinie to bite.

422
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,150
<9-26,Amy>人才呀
<9-26,Amy>Outstanding.

423
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,060
<9-26,Amy>如果失败了  我们可以在CVS停车
<9-26,Amy>And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS

424
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,510
<9-26,Amy>然后给你买个厉害的电动牙刷
<9-26,Amy>and pick you out a nice toothbrush.

425
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,960
<9-26,Amy>我管我的牙刷叫"杰拉德"
<9-26,Amy>I call mine "Gerard."

426
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,600
<9-27,Bernadette>这有点太怪了
<9-27,Bernadette>That's kind of creepy.

428
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,440
<9-27,Bernadette>* 不要让我心碎 *
<9-27,Bernadette>* Don't go breaking my heart *

429
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,870
<9-27,Bernadette>* 如果我奋力一搏  结果也枉然 *
<9-27,Bernadette>* I couldn't if I tried *

430
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,730
<9-27,Bernadette>* 亲爱的  如果我焦躁不安 *
<9-27,Bernadette>* Oh, honey, if I get restless *

431
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,660
<9-27,Bernadette>* 宝贝  你不是这种人 *
<9-27,Bernadette>* Baby, you're not that kind *

432
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,240
<9-27,Bernadette>* 不要让我心碎 *
<9-27,Bernadette>* Don't go breaking my heart *

433
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,320
<10-1,Stuart>有人唱《走在阳光里》了吗
<10-1,Stuart>Anybody do "Walking on Sunshine" Yet?

434
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,130
<10-2,Sheldon>没有
<10-2,Sheldon>No.

435
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,620
<10-3,Stuart>那我定啦
<10-3,Stuart>Dibs.

436
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,010
<11-1,Priya>抱歉  你是说谢尔顿买了台织布机
<11-1,Priya>I'm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom

437
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,270
<11-1,Priya>然后学习织布吗
<11-1,Priya>and learned how to weave?

438
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,640
<11-2,Leonard>他其实学得挺好的
<11-2,Leonard>He actually got pretty good.

439
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,900
<11-2,Leonard>他给我们都做一件相配的毛毯
<11-2,Leonard>He made us all matching serapes.

440
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,770
<11-3,Raj>每当寒风刺骨的时候  我还会拿出来披上
<11-3,Raj>I still wear mine when there's a nip in the air.

441
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,330
<11-4,Priya>那是在他养那25只猫
<11-4,Priya>Now, was this before

442
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,400
<11-4,Priya>的之前还是之后
<11-4,Priya>or after he adopted the 25 cats?

443
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,290
<11-5,Leonard>在养猫很久之前
<11-5,Leonard>Long before the cats.

444
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,680
<11-5,Leonard>我觉得好像是在他试着宣告
<11-5,Leonard>I think it was around the time he tried

445
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,790
<11-5,Leonard>我们的公寓是个主权国家的那段时间
<11-5,Leonard>to declare our apartment a sovereign nation.

446
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,640
<11-5,Leonard>我至今还留有些货币呢
<11-5,Leonard>I still have some of the currency.

447
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,370
<11-6,Sheldon (outside)>我的朋友们
<11-6,Sheldon (outside)>All my friends.

448
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,190
<11-6,Sheldon (outside)>我的朋友们
<11-6,Sheldon (outside)>All my friends.

449
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,720
<11-6,Sheldon (outside)>我的朋友们
<11-6,Sheldon (outside)>All my friends.

450
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,480
<11-7,Howard>我觉得就跟《 阴间大法师》一样
<11-7,Howard>I think it's like Beetlejuice.

451
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,550
<11-7,Howard>咱们刚才总是念叨谢尔顿
<11-7,Howard>We said his name too many times.

452
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,110
<11-8,Raj>-快进来  -谢谢
<11-8,Raj>- Come on in. - Thank you.

453
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,550
<11-10,Leonard>我还以为你跟你的新朋友在一起呢
<11-10,Leonard>Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.

454
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,000
<11-11,Sheldon>我必须得离开
<11-11,Sheldon>I had to leave.

455
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,990
<11-11,Sheldon>他们的玩乐方式有误
<11-11,Sheldon>They were having fun wrong.

456
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,810
<11-12,Priya>过来  谢尔顿  跟我坐
<11-12,Priya>Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.

457
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,060
<11-13,Sheldon>谢谢
<11-13,Sheldon>Thank you.

458
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,700
<11-14,Priya>你来点私房辣椒汤吗
<11-14,Priya>Would you like some homemade chili?

459
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,770
<11-15,Sheldon>汤里有豆子吗
<11-15,Sheldon>Are there beans in it?

460
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,700
<11-16,Priya>有
<11-16,Priya>Yes.

461
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,920
<11-17,Sheldon>那就不是辣椒汤
<11-17,Sheldon>Then it's not chili.

462
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,150
<11-17,Sheldon>地道的辣椒汤是没有豆子的
<11-17,Sheldon>Real chili has no beans in it,

463
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,680
<11-17,Sheldon>但由于你是来自异乡人
<11-17,Sheldon>but you're from a foreign land,

464
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,890
<11-17,Sheldon>你的无知可以被谅解
<11-17,Sheldon>so your ignorance is forgiven.

465
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,990
<11-18,Priya>谢尔顿  你要还是不要
<11-18,Priya>Sheldon, do you want some or not?

466
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,480
<11-19,Sheldon>要  谢谢
<11-19,Sheldon>Yes, please.

467
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,910
<11-19,Sheldon>你女人的脾气有点毛躁呀
<11-19,Sheldon>Your girlfriend's a little short-tempered.

468
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,960
<11-20,Raj>我提议举杯欢庆
<11-20,Raj>I'd like to propose a toast

469
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,240
<11-20,Raj>致朋友们  不管他有多古怪
<11-20,Raj>to friends, no matter how quirky.

470
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,750
<11-21,All>干杯
<11-21,All>Cheers.

471
