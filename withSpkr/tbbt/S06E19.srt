1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,540
<1-1,Bernadette>你在干嘛
<1-1,Bernadette>What you doing?

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,670
<1-2,Howard>你叫我收拾嘛
<1-2,Howard>You said clean up.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,870
<1-2,Howard>我就在收拾啊
<1-2,Howard>I'm cleaning up.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,450
<1-3,Bernadette>你不能只把东西都往衣橱里扔啊
<1-3,Bernadette>You can't just throw everything in the closet.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,980
<1-4,Howard>你可以叫我做事
<1-4,Howard>Hey, you can tell me what to do

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,560
<1-4,Howard>或者是教我做事
<1-4,Howard>or you can tell me how to do it,

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,500
<1-4,Howard>但只有做爱时  才可以边叫边教
<1-4,Howard>but you can't do both; this isn't sex.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,560
<1-5,Bernadette>要是有人看到里面怎么办
<1-5,Bernadette>What if someone looks in there?

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,180
<1-6,Howard>他们只是来吃顿饭而已
<1-6,Howard>They're just coming over for dinner.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,960
<1-6,Howard>没人会看衣橱的啦
<1-6,Howard>No one's gonna look in the closet.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,950
<1-7,Bernadette>谁知道啊
<1-7,Bernadette>Well, you don't know that.

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,180
<1-7,Bernadette>万一有人找厕所
<1-7,Bernadette>What if someone's looking for the bathroom

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,310
<1-7,Bernadette>不小心打开了这扇门呢
<1-7,Bernadette>and they open that door?

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,430
<1-8,Howard>也行啊
<1-8,Howard>Could work out.

15
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,520
<1-8,Howard>这里面某处还真有个厕所呢
<1-8,Howard>For all we know, there's a toilet in there somewhere.

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,790
<1-9,Bernadette>好吧  但今晚过后
<1-9,Bernadette>Fine. But after tonight,

17
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,610
<1-9,Bernadette>我们就得好好整理这衣橱
<1-9,Bernadette>we need to get a handle on this mess.

18
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,360
<1-10,Howard>知道我们应该怎么做吗
<1-10,Howard>You know what we should do?

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,900
<1-10,Howard>故意让谢尔顿看到这衣橱
<1-10,Howard>We should show the closet to Sheldon.

20
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,720
<1-11,Bernadette>为什么
<1-11,Bernadette>Why?

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,880
<1-11,Bernadette>你傻啦
<1-11,Bernadette>Are you kidding?

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,720
<1-12,Howard>他简直是整理大师好吗
<1-12,Howard>He's like a savant at organizing.

23
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,360
<1-12,Howard>他公寓里所有东西都有标签注明
<1-12,Howard>Everything in his apartment has a label on it.

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,040
<1-12,Howard>连他的标签机上  都有个标签
<1-12,Howard>Including his label maker, which has a label

25
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,840
<1-12,Howard>写着"标签机"
<1-12,Howard>that says "Label Maker."

26
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,290
<1-12,Howard>而且如果你仔细往标签机上的标签看
<1-12,Howard>And if you look really close at that label maker label,

27
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,360
<1-12,Howard>你会发现有个小小标签写着"标签"
<1-12,Howard>you'll see a label that says "Label."

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,550
<1-13,Bernadette>他是客人
<1-13,Bernadette>He's our guest;

29
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,900
<1-13,Bernadette>我们怎么可以让客人整理衣橱呢
<1-13,Bernadette>we can't just ask him to straighten our closet.

30
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,060
<1-14,Howard>我们当然不会问他来做
<1-14,Howard>No, we wouldn't ask him.

31
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,660
<1-14,Howard>我们只要让他瞧见就行了
<1-14,Howard>We'd just show him the closet

32
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,260
<1-14,Howard>之后他脑子里的小妖精就会煽动他了
<1-14,Howard>and let the goblins in his head take it from there.

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,460
<1-15,Howard>大家请进
<1-15,Howard>Hey, guys, come on in.

34
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,300
<1-17,Penny>-闻起来好香啊  -谢谢
<1-17,Penny>- Ooh, it smells good. - Thanks.

35
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,610
<1-18,Bernadette>谢尔顿  我知道今晚是你的泰国菜之夜
<1-18,Bernadette>And, Sheldon, I know tonight's the night you eat Thai food,

36
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,740
<1-18,Bernadette>所以我去了亚洲超市  买了一切所需材料
<1-18,Bernadette>so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,920
<1-18,Bernadette>从零开始学
<1-18,Bernadette>and made it from scratch.

38
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,860
<1-19,Sheldon>你不用这样大费周章
<1-19,Sheldon>Oh, you shouldn't have.

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,130
<1-20,Bernadette>这是我的荣幸
<1-20,Bernadette>Oh, it's my pleasure.

40
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,230
<1-21,Sheldon>不  你真的不用这样
<1-21,Sheldon>No, you really shouldn't have.

41
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,670
<1-21,Sheldon>我自己带了
<1-21,Sheldon>I brought my own.

42
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,260
<1-22,Bernadette>你中间还带他去买外卖啦
<1-22,Bernadette>You stopped and got him takeout?

43
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,180
<1-23,Leonard>我没得选嘛
<1-23,Leonard>I had no choice.

44
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,370
<1-23,Leonard>他一直踢我驾驶座背后
<1-23,Leonard>He kept kicking the back of my seat.

45
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,040
<1-24,Bernadette>谢尔顿  我花了一整天时间煮呢
<1-24,Bernadette>Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.

46
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,140
<1-25,Sheldon>好吧...  现在觉得自己蠢了吧
<1-25,Sheldon>Well... now don't you feel silly.

47
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,890
<1-26,Bernadette>带他去看衣橱
<1-26,Bernadette>Show him the closet.

48
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,640
<1-26,Bernadette>生活大爆炸
<1-26,Bernadette>第六季  第十九集

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,260
<2-1,Raj>这春卷真是太美味了
<2-1,Raj>These spring rolls are amazing.

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,900
<2-1,Raj>好手艺啊  伯纳黛特
<2-1,Raj>Good job, Bernadette.

51
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,610
<2-2,Bernadette>那是谢尔顿带来的外卖
<2-2,Bernadette>That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,260
<2-3,Raj>我肯定要不是先吃了你的菜
<2-3,Raj>Oh, well, I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted

53
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,330
<2-3,Raj>这玩意肯定没那么好吃
<2-3,Raj>nearly as good if I hadn't tried your food first.

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,860
<2-4,Sheldon>霍华德  你的衣服想怎么分类
<2-4,Sheldon>Howard, did you want your clothes arranged

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,940
<2-4,Sheldon>是按季节  还是按颜色
<2-4,Sheldon>seasonally or by color?

56
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,760
<2-5,Howard>按颜色就行了
<2-5,Howard>Color's fine.

57
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,790
<2-6,Sheldon>错误  我会按季分类
<2-6,Sheldon>Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,290
<2-7,Penny>谢尔顿  你不坐下陪陪艾米吗
<2-7,Penny>Sheldon, aren't you gonna spend a little time with Amy?

59
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,030
<2-8,Amy>没事的  我习惯了
<2-8,Amy>Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it.

60
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,080
<2-8,Amy>那天在超市  他花了一个小时
<2-8,Amy>The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,930
<2-8,Amy>最佳化起司区的排列法
<2-8,Amy>optimizing the cheese aisle.

62
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,850
<2-9,Sheldon>是啊  但他们都不感激
<2-9,Sheldon>Yeah, and some thanks I got.

63
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,620
<2-9,Sheldon>助理经理还用手工制意大利香肠
<2-9,Sheldon>The assistant manager chased me out

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,640
<2-9,Sheldon>赶我走呢
<2-9,Sheldon>with an artisanal salami.

65
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,020
<2-10,Amy>他的小怪癖让人更爱他
<2-10,Amy>His quirks just make you love him more.

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,800
<2-10,Amy>你们谁也附和我一下嘛
<2-10,Amy>Someone please agree with me.

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,510
<3-1,Leonard>谢尔顿  好啦
<3-1,Leonard>Sheldon, come on.

68
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,740
<3-1,Leonard>时间晚了  回家吧
<3-1,Leonard>It's getting late. Time to go.

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,570
<3-2,Sheldon>再给我五分钟
<3-2,Sheldon>Oh, five more minutes.

70
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,520
<3-3,Leonard>你五分钟前就这么说过了
<3-3,Leonard>That's what you said five minutes ago.

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,040
<3-3,Leonard>艾米和佩妮都在车上等了
<3-3,Leonard>Amy and Penny are already in the car.

72
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,660
<3-3,Leonard>走吧
<3-3,Leonard>Let's move it.

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,790
<3-4,Sheldon>为什么总不让我做我想做的事啊
<3-4,Sheldon>How come I never get to do anything I want to do?

74
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,040
<3-5,Howard>他要是真的想留下到整理完毕
<3-5,Howard>You know, if he really wants to stay and finish,

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,590
<3-5,Howard>我可以载他回家
<3-5,Howard>I can give him a ride home.

76
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,910
<3-6,Sheldon>求你了  莱纳德  他都说没关系了
<3-6,Sheldon>Please, Leonard! He said it's okay!

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,250
<3-6,Sheldon>谢尔顿  都...
<3-6,Sheldon>Sheldon, it's--

78
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,340
<3-7,Leonard>等等  可以不用载你回家吗  拜拜
<3-7,Leonard>Wait, I can go home without you? Bye!

79
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,620
<3-8,Sheldon>霍华德  我有几个问题
<3-8,Sheldon>Howard, I have a few questions.

80
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,250
<3-8,Sheldon>我找到了三个保龄球瓶
<3-8,Sheldon>I found three bowling pins.

81
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,400
<3-8,Sheldon>这是抛接用的三个瓶呢
<3-8,Sheldon>Now, do you juggle these,

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,340
<3-8,Sheldon>还是你丢了七个
<3-8,Sheldon>or are you missing seven?

83
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,380
<3-9,Howard>杂耍抛接
<3-9,Howard>Juggle.

84
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,300
<3-10,Sheldon>小混球害我要想破头了
<3-10,Sheldon>You health nuts kill me.

85
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,970
<3-11,Bernadette>天啊  太整齐了
<3-11,Bernadette>Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

86
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,800
<3-11,Bernadette>看  他发现了我藏起来的抛接球瓶
<3-11,Bernadette>Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.

87
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,990
<3-12,Sheldon>还有几样东西
<3-12,Sheldon>Uh, just a couple more items.

88
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,950
<3-12,Sheldon>霍华德  我在盒子里找到这封你爸写的信
<3-12,Sheldon>Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box.

89
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,490
<3-12,Sheldon>根据里面的内容呢
<3-12,Sheldon>Now, based on the content,

90
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,650
<3-12,Sheldon>可以被分类去...
<3-12,Sheldon>it could either be filed...

91
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,050
<3-13,Howard>你还打开看啦
<3-13,Howard>Whoa, you opened this?

92
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,240
<3-14,Sheldon>得读过才知道这是私人信件
<3-14,Sheldon>Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence

93
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,850
<3-14,Sheldon>还是纪念性的信件  我刚说到
<3-14,Sheldon>or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying,

94
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,470
<3-15,Howard>-根据内容呢...  -我没兴趣知道
<3-15,Howard>- based on the content... - I couldn't be less interested.

95
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,640
<3-15,Howard>走吧  我载你回家吧
<3-15,Howard>Now, come on, I'll take you home.

96
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,930
<3-16,Bernadette>霍华德  你不想知道信里的内容吗
<3-16,Bernadette>Howard, don't you want to know what's in the letter?

97
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,190
<3-17,Howard>我要想知道  我多年前就拆开看了
<3-17,Howard>If I wanted to know, I would've opened it years ago.

98
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,400
<3-17,Howard>衣橱现在看起来超整洁
<3-17,Howard>The closet looks great.

99
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,850
<3-17,Howard>咱们走吧
<3-17,Howard>Let's get out of here.

100
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,260
<3-18,Sheldon>等等  我能拿上这盒
<3-18,Sheldon>Wait, can I bring this box

101
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,950
<3-18,Sheldon>备用衣服纽扣  在车上整理着玩吗
<3-18,Sheldon>of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?

102
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,360
<3-19,Howard>-你高兴就好  -谢谢
<3-19,Howard>- Do whatever you want. - Thanks.

103
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,060
<3-20,Sheldon>今晚派对超棒
<3-20,Sheldon>Great party.

104
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,510
<4-1,Leonard>你知道我刚认识霍华德那会
<4-1,Leonard>You know, when I first met Howard,

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,300
<4-1,Leonard>他会把阴囊从短裤里拉出来
<4-1,Leonard>he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts

106
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,750
<4-1,Leonard>然后大喊  "看  我坐到口香糖上了"
<4-1,Leonard>and say, "oh, I sat in gum."

107
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,580
<4-2,Penny>你到底想说什么
<4-2,Penny>What is your point?

108
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,060
<4-3,Leonard>如今他变得这么成熟  感觉怪怪的
<4-3,Leonard>Well, it's just kind of weird how grown up he is now.

109
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,450
<4-3,Leonard>婚姻美满  还会在家宴请朋友
<4-3,Leonard>Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.

110
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,010
<4-4,Penny>是吗  你直接这么说不行吗
<4-4,Penny>Really? You couldn't just say that?

111
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,320
<4-4,Penny>还非得讲一遍阴囊的故事
<4-4,Penny>You had to tell the scrotum story?

112
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,960
<4-5,Leonard>描述下他以前幼稚的画面嘛
<4-5,Leonard>Trying to paint a picture.

113
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,940
<4-6,Penny>换个方式  不再围着咖啡桌吃外卖
<4-6,Penny>Yeah, it was a nice change of pace

114
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,870
<4-6,Penny>的确也是不错的改变
<4-6,Penny>not eating takeout around a coffee table.

115
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,570
<4-7,Leonard>要知道  我们也可以宴请一下朋友们
<4-7,Leonard>Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too.

116
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,600
<4-7,Leonard>还可以要求大家都盛装出席
<4-7,Leonard>Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.

117
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,550
<4-7,Leonard>好呀
<4-7,Leonard>Sure.

118
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,050
<4-8,Penny>不过  你所谓的盛装出席
<4-8,Penny>Just, when you say "Dressed up,"

119
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,120
<4-8,Penny>是指穿着得体的衣服  是吧
<4-8,Penny>you mean nice clothes, right?

120
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,660
<4-8,Penny>而不是指穿着斗篷紧身衣之类的玩意
<4-8,Penny>Not, like, capes and tights and crap?

121
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,520
<4-8,Penny>当然
<4-8,Penny>Yeah.

122
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,550
<4-9,Leonard>-不过  -不行
<4-9,Leonard>- Although... - No!

123
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,520
<5-1,Bernadette>华仔  你没事吧
<5-1,Bernadette>Howie, you okay?

124
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,740
<5-2,Howard>没事  我只是...睡不着
<5-2,Howard>Yeah, I just... couldn't sleep.

125
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,990
<5-3,Bernadette>都叫你晚餐后别喝浓缩咖啡了
<5-3,Bernadette>Told you you shouldn't have espresso after dinner.

126
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,440
<5-3,Bernadette>我知道那些小杯子显得你人高马大
<5-3,Bernadette>I know the little cups make you feel big,

127
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,150
<5-3,Bernadette>可这实在是得不偿失呀
<5-3,Bernadette>but it's not worth it.

128
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,420
<5-4,Howard>都怪这份讨厌的信
<5-4,Howard>It's this stupid letter.

129
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,830
<5-5,Bernadette>你看了吗
<5-5,Bernadette>Did you read it?

130
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,380
<5-6,Howard>没有
<5-6,Howard>No.

131
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,970
<5-7,Bernadette>你一定很好奇
<5-7,Bernadette>You must be curious.

132
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,620
<5-7,Bernadette>我当然好奇了
<5-7,Bernadette>Of course I'm curious.

133
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,050
<5-8,Howard>从很小的时候
<5-8,Howard>I haven't seen the man since,

134
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,510
<5-8,Howard>我就再也没见过他了
<5-8,Howard>oh, I was a little kid.

135
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,440
<5-8,Howard>然后在我18岁生日时突然寄来一封信
<5-8,Howard>And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday?

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,130
<5-8,Howard>这算是什么意思
<5-8,Howard>What's that about?

137
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,470
<5-8,Howard>你为什么不读读看呢
<5-8,Howard>Why don't you read it?

138
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,240
<5-9,Bernadette>也许他为不辞而别做出了道歉或者解释
<5-9,Bernadette>Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.

139
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,690
<5-10,Howard>他抛弃了我和我妈
<5-10,Howard>He abandoned me and my mother.

140
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,980
<5-10,Howard>他有什么资格来做解释呢
<5-10,Howard>Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?

141
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,440
<5-11,Bernadette>我明白
<5-11,Bernadette>I get that.

142
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,040
<5-11,Bernadette>那你准备怎么办呢
<5-11,Bernadette>So, what do you want to do with it?

143
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
<5-12,Howard>很久以前我就应该这么做了
<5-12,Howard>Something I should've done a long time ago.

144
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,710
<5-13,Bernadette>-真的  你确定吗  -确定
<5-13,Bernadette>- Really? Are you sure? - Yep.

145
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,700
<5-15,Bernadette>-心里舒服点了吗  -舒服了
<5-15,Bernadette>- Feel better? - I do.

146
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,270
<5-15,Bernadette>这下好了
<5-15,Bernadette>Great.

147
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,590
<5-16,Howard>咱俩的身高都够不着那烟雾报警器
<5-16,Howard>Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.

148
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,180
<6-1,Amy>我真不敢相信他烧掉了那封信
<6-1,Amy>I can't believe he set it on fire.

149
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,820
<6-2,Bernadette>对啊  他看到那封信就心烦
<6-2,Bernadette>Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out.

150
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,870
<6-2,Bernadette>再说他那天本来就过得不开心
<6-2,Bernadette>And he was already having a tough day

151
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,580
<6-2,Bernadette>他不小心穿着我的裤子去上班了
<6-2,Bernadette>'cause he accidentally wore my pants to work.

152
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,770
<6-2,Bernadette>我真不懂他有什么不开心的
<6-2,Bernadette>I don't know why he was upset.

153
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,050
<6-2,Bernadette>他穿那裤子比我穿着还宽松呢
<6-2,Bernadette>They were bigger on him than me.

154
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,450
<6-3,Amy>我真好奇那信里写了什么
<6-3,Amy>Boy, I'm really curious what's in that letter.

155
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,830
<6-4,Bernadette>我也好奇  不过我们永远无法知道了
<6-4,Bernadette>Me, too, but I guess now we'll never know.

156
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,130
<6-5,Amy>你说谢尔顿读过那封信
<6-5,Amy>Well, you said Sheldon read it.

157
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,360
<6-5,Amy>何不去问问他
<6-5,Amy>Why not ask him?

158
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,140
<6-6,Bernadette>我不能这么做
<6-6,Bernadette>I can't do that.

159
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,240
<6-6,Bernadette>不尊重老公的隐私
<6-6,Bernadette>What kind of wife would I be

160
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,430
<6-6,Bernadette>还算什么好人妻呢
<6-6,Bernadette>if I didn't respect my husband's privacy?

161
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,630
<6-7,Penny>如果我去问谢尔顿的时候
<6-7,Penny>What if I ask Sheldon,

162
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,100
<6-7,Penny>你"碰巧"在场呢
<6-7,Penny>you just happen to be in the room?

163
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,450
<6-8,Bermadette>-这主意好  -走吧
<6-8,Bermadette>- That works. - Okay.

164
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,060
<7-1,Sheldon>就跟清理整幢大楼的脏肚脐眼似的
<7-1,Sheldon>Like cleaning out the entire building's belly button.

165
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,520
<7-2,Penny>-谢尔顿  -你们好
<7-2,Penny>- Hey, Sheldon. - Oh, hello.

166
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,280
<7-3,Sheldon>有什么能为你们效劳的吗
<7-3,Sheldon>What can I do for you ladies?

167
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,140
<7-4,Amy>你有我们想要的东西
<7-4,Amy>You have something we want.

168
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,900
<7-5,Sheldon>乖乖
<7-5,Sheldon>Oh, dear.

169
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,690
<7-5,Sheldon>我妈曾经警告过我
<7-5,Sheldon>My mother warned me

170
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,600
<7-5,Sheldon>小帅哥进了大城市  就会遇到这种事
<7-5,Sheldon>this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.

171
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,200
<7-6,Penny>不  我们想要知道点信息
<7-6,Penny>No, we just want information.

172
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,700
<7-7,Sheldon>这个我绝对能帮上忙
<7-7,Sheldon>Oh, I've got that in spades.

173
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,200
<7-7,Sheldon>用问题蹂躏我吧
<7-7,Sheldon>Ravage me.

174
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,960
<7-8,Penny>我们听说你读了霍华德他爸写的信
<7-8,Penny>We heard you read the letter from Howard's father.

175
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,990
<7-9,Sheldon>我读了
<7-9,Sheldon>I did.

176
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,920
<7-10,Penny>信里写了什么
<7-10,Penny>What did it say?

177
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,910
<7-10,Penny>这个
<7-10,Penny>Yeah...

178
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,490
<7-11,Sheldon>我可不能告诉你们
<7-11,Sheldon>I can't tell you that.

179
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,840
<7-11,Sheldon>我得遵守衣橱主人和整理者之间的保密协议
<7-11,Sheldon>I'm bound by closet organizer/ organizee confidentiality.

180
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,870
<7-12,Amy>谢尔顿  世上才没有那种规定呢
<7-12,Amy>Sheldon, that's not a real thing.

181
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,720
<7-13,Sheldon>那世上也没有规定说看电影时
<7-13,Sheldon>Well, neither is the rule that you have to

182
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,130
<7-13,Sheldon>必须紧握你女友的手呀
<7-13,Sheldon>hold your girlfriend's hand at the movies. You know.

183
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,800
<7-13,Sheldon>你还不是照样对我上下其手
<7-13,Sheldon>That doesn't stop you from pawing at me

184
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,810
<7-13,Sheldon>就像你是大狗熊  我是蜜罐子一样
<7-13,Sheldon>like you're a bear and I'm a trash can full of sweets.

185
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,290
<7-14,Penny>你管什么多干嘛
<7-14,Penny>Why do you even care?

186
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,630
<7-14,Penny>把信的内容告诉我们就是了
<7-14,Penny>Just tell us what it says.

187
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,110
<7-15,Sheldon>那封信的内容的所有权
<7-15,Sheldon>Control over the information contained in that letter

188
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,290
<7-15,Sheldon>是属于霍华德的
<7-15,Sheldon>belongs to Howard.

189
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,440
<7-15,Sheldon>我是偶尔不小心读到的
<7-15,Sheldon>By happenstance, I came to know it.

190
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,320
<7-15,Sheldon>这并不代表我可以到处散布它
<7-15,Sheldon>That doesn't give me the right to disseminate it freely.

191
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,760
<7-16,Penny>拜托  那封信是在伯纳黛特的衣橱找到的
<7-16,Penny>Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet.

192
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
<7-16,Penny>这好歹也意味点什么吧
<7-16,Penny>Doesn't that count for something?

193
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,030
<7-17,Sheldon>你是想说加州政府是
<7-17,Sheldon>Are you pointing out that California

194
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,500
<7-17,Sheldon>认同联合财产的
<7-17,Sheldon>is a community property state,

195
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,790
<7-17,Sheldon>既然霍华德和伯纳黛特已经结婚了
<7-17,Sheldon>and since Howard and Bernadette are married,

196
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,000
<7-17,Sheldon>那么那封信所含有的知识产权
<7-17,Sheldon>the intellectual property contained in that letter

197
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,040
<7-17,Sheldon>理应由夫妇俩人共享吗
<7-17,Sheldon>is jointly owned by the two spouses?

198
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,820
<7-18,Penny>对  就是这个意思
<7-18,Penny>Yeah, obviously.

199
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,210
<7-19,Sheldon>你厉害
<7-19,Sheldon>Well played.

200
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
<7-19,Sheldon>有时候我真是小看你了  佩妮
<7-19,Sheldon>Sometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny.

201
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,910
<8-1,Raj>老兄  你来找我商量开派对的事
<8-1,Raj>Dude, you made the right choice

202
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,840
<8-1,Raj>真是找对人了
<8-1,Raj>coming to me for help with this party.

203
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,420
<8-2,Leonard>其实  我只是邀请了你而已
<8-2,Leonard>Actually, all I did was invite you.

204
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,730
<8-3,Raj>好了  你就放宽心吧
<8-3,Raj>Well, put your mind at ease.

205
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,620
<8-3,Raj>有我相助  霍华德的晚宴
<8-3,Raj>I'm here to make sure your dinner party

206
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,400
<8-3,Raj>一定会被你的晚宴打得落花流水
<8-3,Raj>kicks Howard's dinner party's ass.

207
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,200
<8-3,Raj>现在我们首先需要确定一个主题
<8-3,Raj>Now, the first thing we need is a theme.

208
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,080
<8-3,Raj>我在想
<8-3,Raj>I'm thinking...

209
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,950
<8-3,Raj>19到20世纪之交时期的红磨坊
<8-3,Raj>ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.

210
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,440
<8-4,Leonard>我觉得你需要贴睾酮贴片增加雄性激素了
<8-4,Leonard>I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch.

211
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,180
<8-4,Leonard>我和佩妮是想以低调为主
<8-4,Leonard>Penny and I just want to do something low-key.

212
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,510
<8-4,Leonard>就像鸡尾酒
<8-4,Leonard>You know, cocktails,

213
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,200
<8-4,Leonard>轻柔的爵士乐  开胃小吃
<8-4,Leonard>light jazz music, hors d'oeuvres.

214
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,660
<8-5,Raj>所以你的主题是
<8-5,Raj>So your theme is

215
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,520
<8-5,Raj>"我看了一集《广告狂人》的重播
<8-5,Raj>"I saw a rerun of Mad Men

216
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,750
<8-5,Raj>然后从连锁超市买来蟹肉酥"
<8-5,Raj>and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe's"?

217
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,180
<8-5,Raj>我可不想错过
<8-5,Raj>Hate to miss that.

218
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,100
<8-6,Leonard>你去哪里了
<8-6,Leonard>Hey, where have you been?

219
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
<8-7,Sheldon>莱纳德
<8-7,Sheldon>Oh, Leonard.

220
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,980
<8-7,Sheldon>如果我要讥讽你的话
<8-7,Sheldon>If I was prone to sarcasm,

221
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,110
<8-7,Sheldon>我会说我刚在洗衣篮博物馆里
<8-7,Sheldon>I'd say I was pulling off a major heist

222
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,110
<8-7,Sheldon>干了一票大劫案
<8-7,Sheldon>at the museum of laundry baskets.

223
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,870
<8-8,Leonard>一  二  三  四  五
<8-8,Leonard>One, two, three, four, five,

<8-8,Leonard>六  七  八  九  十[愤怒控制]
<8-8,Leonard>six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

225
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,690
<8-8,Leonard>我是说  "天啊  谢尔顿
<8-8,Leonard>I meant, "Golly, Sheldon,

226
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,490
<8-8,Leonard>你刚去了有够久的"
<8-8,Leonard>you've been gone a long time."

227
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,100
<8-9,Sheldon>因为我被佩妮和伯纳黛特
<8-9,Sheldon>Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by

228
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,000
<8-9,Sheldon>还有艾米拦住问话了
<8-9,Sheldon>Penny, Bernadette and Amy.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,960
<8-9,Sheldon>她们让我泄露霍华德父亲的
<8-9,Sheldon>They made me reveal confidential information

230
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,500
<8-9,Sheldon>机密信息
<8-9,Sheldon>about Howard's father.

231
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,660
<8-10,Leonard>什么信息
<8-10,Leonard>What information?

232
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,550
<8-10,Leonard>我不能告诉你们
<8-10,Leonard>I can't tell you that.

233
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,670
<8-11,Sheldon>我必须遵守
<8-11,Sheldon>I am bound by closet

234
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,890

<8-11,Sheldon>organizer/ organizee confidentiality.

235
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,220
<8-12,Raj>拜托啦  我们不会告诉任何人的
<8-12,Raj>Well, come on, we won't tell anyone.

236
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,670
<8-13,Sheldon>抱歉  纠缠我也没用
<8-13,Sheldon>Sorry, badgering me won't work.

237
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,180
<8-13,Sheldon>你应该这么说
<8-13,Sheldon>What you should have said is,

238
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,640
<8-13,Sheldon>"没必要保守这个秘密
<8-13,Sheldon>"It's pointless to keep this a secret

239
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,860
<8-13,Sheldon>因为佩妮会告诉我们的"
<8-13,Sheldon>because Penny will tell us."

240
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,410
<8-14,Leonard>-那我问佩妮  -好吧  我告诉你们
<8-14,Leonard>- Fine, then that. - All right, I'll tell you.

241
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,140
<8-15,Sheldon>天啊  今天每个人都很会找理由嘛
<8-15,Sheldon>My goodness, everyone's on their game today.

242
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,840
<9-1,Amy>这真的很好玩
<9-1,Amy>This is really fun.

243
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,290
<9-2,Raj>是啊  偶尔穿正装也不错
<9-2,Raj>Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up once in a while.

244
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,970
<9-3,Penny>对啊  开胃小吃令人愉悦
<9-3,Penny>Yeah, and hors d'oeuvres are delightful.

245
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,180
<9-4,Leonard>就像我的女伴
<9-4,Leonard>As is the company.

246
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,010
<9-6,Sheldon>我的衣服痒死了  真希望死了算了
<9-6,Sheldon>My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.

247
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,130
<9-7,Leonard>大家  听着
<9-7,Leonard>Hey, uh, listen, everybody.

248
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,120
<9-7,Leonard>在霍华德来之前  我们统一口径
<9-7,Leonard>Before Howard gets here, let's all just agree

249
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,780
<9-7,Leonard>不要提起他父亲的信
<9-7,Leonard>to not bring up the letter from his father.

250
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,490
<9-8,Raj>-好  -知道
<9-8,Raj>- Of course. - Sure.

251
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,600
<9-10,Amy>当然不会
<9-10,Amy>Absolutely.

252
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,610
<9-11,Sheldon>如果我也同意
<9-11,Sheldon>If I say yes,

253
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,280
<9-11,Sheldon>能不能关掉那拉丁的放荡音乐
<9-11,Sheldon>can we turn off that Latin orgy music?

254
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,030
<10-1,Howard>我们还得走这么多层楼梯
<10-1,Howard>Ridiculous that we still have to walk

255
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,950
<10-1,Howard>真是太荒谬了
<10-1,Howard>up all these flights of stairs.

256
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,580
<10-2,Bernadette>对啊  尤其是穿着高跟鞋
<10-2,Bernadette>Yeah, try doing it in heels.

257
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,130
<10-3,Howard>我就穿着呢
<10-3,Howard>I am.

258
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,210
<10-4,Bernadette>慢着
<10-4,Bernadette>Wait.

259
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,820
<10-4,Bernadette>我有话要对你说
<10-4,Bernadette>There's something I have to tell you.

260
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,920
<10-5,Howard>什么
<10-5,Howard>What?

261
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,680
<10-6,Bernadette>我知道那封信的内容了
<10-6,Bernadette>I know what was in your dad's letter.

262
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,150
<10-7,Howard>谢尔顿  我发誓我一定要杀了你
<10-7,Howard>Sheldon, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!

263
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,050
<10-9,Bernadette>是我逼他告诉我们的
<10-9,Bernadette>I made him tell us.

264
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,310
<10-10,Howard>"我们"
<10-10,Howard>What? "Us"?

265
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,640
<10-10,Howard>谁还知道
<10-10,Howard>Who else knows?

266
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,940
<10-12,Amy>-我  -我也是
<10-12,Amy>- I know. - Me, too.

267
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,140
<10-13,Leonard>还有我
<10-13,Leonard>Same here.

268
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,210
<10-14,Raj>真为你们感到羞耻
<10-14,Raj>Shame on all of you.

269
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,530
<10-15,Leonard>你不也知道了吗
<10-15,Leonard>You know, too.

270
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,310
<10-16,Raj>非得全军覆没  就不能给他留一个朋友吗
<10-16,Raj>Couldn't leave him with one friend, could you?

271
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,080
<10-17,Howard>所以除了我
<10-17,Howard>So everybody knows

272
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,940
<10-17,Howard>大家都知道那封信的内容
<10-17,Howard>what's in that letter except for me?

273
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,210
<10-18,Sheldon>对  现在是六对一
<10-18,Sheldon>Yes, it's six against one.

274
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,870
<10-18,Sheldon>别轻举妄动  先生
<10-18,Sheldon>Stand down, sir.

275
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
<10-19,Howard>你怎么能这样呢
<10-19,Howard>How could you do this?

276
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,520
<10-20,Bernadette>对不起
<10-20,Bernadette>I'm sorry.

277
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,630
<10-21,Raj>如果你想知道  我们可以告诉你
<10-21,Raj>If you want, we could tell you.

278
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,690
<10-22,Howard>不  我不想知道
<10-22,Howard>No, I don't want to know!

279
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,630
<10-22,Howard>我是说
<10-22,Howard>I mean,

280
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,620
<10-22,Howard>我是想知道  但...
<10-22,Howard>I do, but...

281
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,350
<10-22,Howard>我要走了
<10-22,Howard>I got to go.

282
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,650
<10-23,Amy>用我来当人肉盾牌
<10-23,Amy>Used me as a human shield?

283
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,170
<10-24,Sheldon>人家慌了嘛
<10-24,Sheldon>I panicked.

284
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,460
<10-24,Sheldon>他比平时看起来高大
<10-24,Sheldon>He looked taller than usual.

285
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,800
<11-2,Howard>-霍华德  -这里
<11-2,Howard>- Howard? - In here.

286
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,390
<11-2,Howard>对不起
<11-2,Howard>I'm sorry.

287
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,250
<11-3,Bernadette>我不应该多事的
<11-3,Bernadette>I should have left it alone.

288
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,040
<11-3,Bernadette>没关系
<11-3,Bernadette>It's okay.

289
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,130
<11-4,Howard>抱歉我就这么走了
<11-4,Howard>Sorry I ran off like that.

290
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,400
<11-5,Bernadette>你在看什么
<11-5,Bernadette>What are you looking at?

291
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,350
<11-6,Howard>我小时候跟爸爸的合照
<11-6,Howard>Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.

292
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,980
<11-7,Bernadette>-那很好啊  -不得不说
<11-7,Bernadette>- That's nice.  - I got to tell you,

293
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,100
<11-8,Howard>虽然谢尔顿泄密让我很生气
<11-8,Howard>as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing,

294
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,960
<11-8,Howard>但他的确把这个衣橱整理得很好
<11-8,Howard>he did a hell of a job organizing this closet.

295
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,120
<11-8,Howard>瞧瞧这个
<11-8,Howard>Look at this.

296
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,280
<11-8,Howard>"父亲永别前  沃罗威茨一家照片"
<11-8,Howard>"Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever."

297
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,350
<11-8,Howard>瞧九岁时满头小辫子的华仔
<11-8,Howard>Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows.

298
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,280
<11-8,Howard>无论黑人犹太人  看了都会不爽
<11-8,Howard>Neither race was happy to see me with those.

299
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,760
<11-9,Bernadette>-你想不想休息一下  -为什么
<11-9,Bernadette>- Think you could take a break? - Why?

300
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,390
<11-11,Bernadette>我有个惊喜要给你
<11-11,Bernadette>Got a little surprise for you.

301
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,360
<11-11,Bernadette>来吧
<11-11,Bernadette>Come on.

302
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,510
<11-12,Howard>亲爱的
<11-12,Howard>Oh, honey...

303
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,470
<11-12,Howard>我今晚没心情做爱
<11-12,Howard>I am in no mood to have sex tonight.

304
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,530
<11-12,Howard>如果你一定要做
<11-12,Howard>I'll lay there if you absolutely

305
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,220
<11-12,Howard>那我就勉强躺在下面好了
<11-12,Howard>have to have it, but...

306
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,710
<11-12,Howard>你们来这里干嘛
<11-12,Howard>What are you guys doing here?

307
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,400
<11-13,Leonard>你走时并没有很明确表明
<11-13,Leonard>When you left, you weren't sure whether or not

308
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,350
<11-13,Leonard>自己是否想知道信上的内容
<11-13,Leonard>you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter,

309
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,440
<11-13,Leonard>所以我们想出了一个很酷的解决办法
<11-13,Leonard>so we came up with kind of a cool solution.

310
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,930
<11-14,Howard>是吗  是什么
<11-14,Howard>Oh, yeah, what's that?

311
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,300
<11-15,Sheldon>很简单
<11-15,Sheldon>It's simple, really.

312
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,600
<11-15,Sheldon>我突然意识到  知道和不知道
<11-15,Sheldon>It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing

313
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,110
<11-15,Sheldon>可以通过创造量子力学叠加状态的
<11-15,Sheldon>can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example

314
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,860
<11-15,Sheldon>宏观例子来完成
<11-15,Sheldon>of quantum superposition.

315
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,020
<11-15,Sheldon>原理是
<11-15,Sheldon>The-the principle

316
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,720
<11-15,Sheldon>物理系统部分存在于
<11-15,Sheldon>that a physical system exists partially

317
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,060
<11-15,Sheldon>所有可能状态
<11-15,Sheldon>in all its possible states at once.

318
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,360
<11-16,Penny>我们都是这样想的  真的
<11-16,Penny>We were all thinking it, really.

319
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,690
<11-16,Penny>这就像房里的大象一样[显而易见]
<11-16,Penny>It was kind of the elephant in the room, so...

320
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,200
<11-17,Sheldon>总之  我意识到
<11-17,Sheldon>Anyway, um, I realize

321
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,060
<11-17,Sheldon>如果我们每人对你父亲信件的内容
<11-17,Sheldon>if we each present you with an account

322
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,620
<11-17,Sheldon>作出一番陈述
<11-17,Sheldon>of what your father wrote to you,

323
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,490
<11-17,Sheldon>但只有一个是真的
<11-17,Sheldon>only one of which is true,

324
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,730
<11-17,Sheldon>我们不告诉你哪个是真的
<11-17,Sheldon>and then we don't tell you which one it is,

325
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,360
<11-17,Sheldon>你会永远
<11-17,Sheldon>you will forever be

326
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,850
<11-17,Sheldon>处于认知的矛盾状态中
<11-17,Sheldon>in a state of epistemic ambivalence.

327
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,800
<11-17,Sheldon>对
<11-17,Sheldon>Yeah.

328
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,140
<11-18,Penny>我说如果不是认知的
<11-18,Penny>And I said if it wasn't epistemic,

329
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,170
<11-18,Penny>咱们就干脆别忙活了
<11-18,Penny>we might as well not do it.

330
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,230
<11-19,Bernadette>坐下  亲爱的
<11-19,Bernadette>Sit down, honey.

331
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,800
<11-20,Leonard>拉杰  你先来
<11-20,Leonard>Raj, you're up.

332
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,370
<11-21,Raj>好的
<11-21,Raj>Okay, um...

333
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,870
<11-21,Raj>那是一张庆祝你18岁的生日卡
<11-21,Raj>It was a card for your 18th birthday.

334
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,310
<11-21,Raj>上面写着
<11-21,Raj>Inside it said,

335
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,010
<11-21,Raj>"生日快乐  霍华德
<11-21,Raj>"Happy birthday, Howard.

<11-21,Raj>我爱你  老爸"
<11-21,Raj>I love you. Dad."

337
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,910
<11-21,Raj>而且还是一张搞笑贺卡
<11-21,Raj>Oh, and it was a Far Side card,

338
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,610
<11-21,Raj>一只青蛙的舌头粘在了
<11-21,Raj>the one where the frog has its tongue

339
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,960
<11-21,Raj>飞机的下面
<11-21,Raj>stuck to the underside of an airplane.

340
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
<11-21,Raj>它以为飞机是苍蝇
<11-21,Raj>Thinks it's a fly.

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,780
<11-21,Raj>白痴青蛙  太搞笑了
<11-21,Raj>Silly frog. So funny.

342
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,010
<11-22,Leonard>谢尔顿
<11-22,Leonard>Sheldon.

343
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,100
<11-23,Sheldon>那是一张藏宝图  可以找到著名海盗
<11-23,Sheldon>It was a map leading to the lost treasure

344
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,060
<11-23,Sheldon>独眼韦利传说中的宝藏
<11-23,Sheldon>of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.

345
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,240
<11-24,Howard>亏你想的到
<11-24,Howard>Nice try.

346
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,320
<11-24,Howard>这是《七宝奇谋》的情节
<11-24,Howard>That's the plot for Goonies.

347
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,080
<11-25,Amy>-早说了  -闭嘴
<11-25,Amy>-Told you. - Don't.

348
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,160
<11-27,Leonard>艾米
<11-27,Leonard>Amy.

349
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,540
<11-28,Amy>你并不知道
<11-28,Amy>You didn't know it,

350
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,390
<11-28,Amy>但你高中毕业时
<11-28,Amy>but your father was in the auditorium

351
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,680
<11-28,Amy>你父亲在观众席上
<11-28,Amy>at your high school graduation.

352
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,810
<11-28,Amy>他哭了  因为他为你骄傲
<11-28,Amy>And he cried because he was so proud of you.

353
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,260
<11-29,Howard>真的吗
<11-29,Howard>Really?

354
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
<11-30,Sheldon>也有可能完全是艾米瞎编的废话
<11-30,Sheldon>Or that's complete poppycock which Amy made up.

355
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,190
<11-30,Sheldon>藏宝图才是真的
<11-30,Sheldon>It still could be the map.

356

<11-32,Penny>that your dad wasn't who he said he was.

359
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,540
<11-32,Penny>当时他另一个身份的麻烦找上了他
<11-32,Penny>Eventually, his other life caught up to him,

360
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,440
<11-32,Penny>唯一保护你们母子安全的办法
<11-32,Penny>and the only way to keep you and your mom safe

361
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,600
<11-32,Penny>就是他离开

<11-33,Sheldon>海盗的名字其实叫假腿安托万
<11-33,Sheldon>The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine.

364
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,370
<11-33,Sheldon>现在和《七宝奇谋》就完全不同了
<11-33,Sheldon>Now it's completely different from Goonies.

365
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,470
<11-34,Amy>-没什么区别  -闭嘴
<11-34,Amy>-No, it's not. - Don't.

<11-36,Leonard>到我了

368
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,270
<11-36,Leonard>希望你不要像他那样不懂珍惜
<11-36,Leonard>and that you should never throw it away like he did.

369
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,670
<11-38,Leonard>伯纳黛特

<11-39,Bernadette>拍的是你出生时你爸抱着你
<11-39,Bernadette>of your dad holding you the day you were born.

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,130
<11-42,Howard>希望这些全是真的

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,110
<11-47,Leonard>好的
<11-47,Leonard>Yeah, cool.

389
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,730
<11-49,Sheldon>出人意料的是
<11-49,Sheldon>You know, surprisingly,

390
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,000
<11-49,Sheldon>你父亲的信
<11-49,Sheldon>uh, the letter from your father

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
<11-49,Sheldon>并不是我在衣橱里
<11-49,Sheldon>wasn't the most interesting thing

392
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,310
<11-49,Sheldon>看到的最有意思的东西
<11-49,Sheldon>I read in the closet.

393
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,730
<11-49,Sheldon>伯纳黛特日记的内容相当有料啊
<11-49,Sheldon>Bernadette's diary has some saucy passages.

394
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
<11-50,Bernadette>谢尔顿  你敢
<11-50,Bernadette>Sheldon, don't you dare!

395
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,690
<11-51,Sheldon>不用担心
<11-51,Sheldon>Th-There's nothing to worry about.

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,580
<11-51,Sheldon>我不会泄露你的秘密
<11-51,Sheldon>Your secret's safe with me.

397
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,680
<11-52,Bernadette>这还差不多
<11-52,Bernadette>That's more like it.

398
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,170
<11-53,Sheldon>不过版权法允许我在回忆时
<11-53,Sheldon>Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets

399
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,390
<11-53,Sheldon>引用其中的片段
<11-53,Sheldon>in the context of a review.

402
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,560
<12-2,Howard>如果我知道我们要跳舞
<12-2,Howard>If I'd known we were gonna be dancing,

403
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,110
<12-2,Howard>就穿平底鞋来了
<12-2,Howard>would have worn my flats.

404
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,560
<12-3,Penny>派对真不错啊
<12-3,Penny>This turned out pretty well, huh?

<12-4,Leonard>我也这样想
<12-4,Leonard>Yeah, I think so.

406
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,780
<12-5,Raj>我同意
<12-5,Raj>I agree.

407
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,880
<12-5,Raj>前提是从未参加或听说过派对
<12-5,Raj>That is, if you've never been to or heard of a party before.

408
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,120
<12-6,Amy>如果你让我在你脑袋上正确的位置
<12-6,Amy>If you'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,410
<12-6,Amy>用根滚烫的针刺一下  你就会永远开心了

412
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,280
<12-7,Sheldon>你保留这只死鱼
<12-7,Sheldon>Is there any reason

413
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,620
<12-7,Sheldon>是有原因的吗
<12-7,Sheldon>you're keeping this dead goldfish?

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,660
<12-8,Penny>见鬼  我忘记喂食了
<12-8,Penny>Damn, I forgot to feed him.

<12-8,Penny>也忘记我养了鱼
<12-8,Penny>And that I had him.

416
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,330
<12-9,Sheldon>你还养了狗吗
<12-9,Sheldon>Well, now, did you also have a dog?

417
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,380
<12-9,Sheldon>我找到了一个
<12-9,Sheldon>Because I found what appears to be

418
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,650
<12-9,Sheldon>电池驱动的咬咬玩具[震动棒]
<12-9,Sheldon>a battery-operated chew toy.
