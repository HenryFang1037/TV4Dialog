3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:03,700
<1-1,Leonard>被敌人包围
<1-1,Leonard>We're pinned down!

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,790
<1-2,Howard>我们冲不出去了
<1-2,Howard>We can't get through!

5
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,290
<1-3,Raj>谢尔顿 快过来帮忙
<1-3,Raj>Sheldon, get over here and help!

6
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,290
<1-4,Sheldon>好 马上来
<1-4,Sheldon>Okay, one second.

7
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,460
<1-5,Leonard>谢尔顿 你干嘛在原地上下蹦
<1-5,Leonard>Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?

8
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,800
<1-6,Sheldon>我试着开枪呢
<1-6,Sheldon>I'm trying to shoot.

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,090
<1-7,Howard>那你按开枪钮啊
<1-7,Howard>Then use the shoot button,

10
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,840
<1-7,Howard>不是按“演示跳跳虎的强项”钮
<1-7,Howard>not the "wonderful thing about Tiggers" button!

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,350
<1-9,Raj>结束了 团灭
<1-9,Raj>That's it, we're dead.

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,350
<1-10,Howard>申请再战
<1-10,Howard>Okay, challenge them again.

13
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,730
<1-11,Leonard>战书已下
<1-11,Leonard>Doing it right now.

14
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,850
<1-11,Leonard>他们打不了
<1-11,Leonard>Oh, they can't.

15
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,860
<1-11,Leonard>明天有场重要的9到12岁儿童棒球大赛呢
<1-11,Leonard>There's an important Little League game tomorrow.

16
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,400
<1-12,Howard>难怪能虐我们 人家是运动员
<1-12,Howard>No wonder they beat us, they're jocks.

17
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,030
<1-13,Sheldon>我这是怎么了
<1-13,Sheldon>What happened to me?

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,990
<1-13,Sheldon>我曾叱咤游戏界
<1-13,Sheldon>I used to excel at these things.

19
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,990
<1-14,Howard>小孩子向来比较会打电玩
<1-14,Howard>Kids are always better at video games.

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,450
<1-15,Sheldon>我讨厌这样
<1-15,Sheldon>Well, I don't like it.

21
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,450
<1-16,Leonard>有句安慰的话不知该不该讲 你穿着还像小孩
<1-16,Leonard>Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,910
<1-17,Sheldon>不 不只是电玩
<1-17,Sheldon>No, but it's not just video games.

23
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,830
<1-17,Sheldon>我给手机更新了版本 我花了一周
<1-17,Sheldon>I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week

24
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,630
<1-17,Sheldon>不再意外给人发送亲亲表情
<1-17,Sheldon>to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.

25
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,630
<1-18,Howard>所以我们的爱情是假的吗
<1-18,Howard>Oh, so our love is not real?

26
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,800
<1-19,Raj>我懂你的感觉
<1-19,Raj>Well, I-I know how you feel.

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,430
<1-19,Raj>我试着用过日本的全自动马桶
<1-19,Raj>I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets,

28
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,520
<1-19,Raj>结果差点把我弹飞出厕所
<1-19,Raj>practically shot myself across the room.

29
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,100
<1-20,Sheldon>看来我不得不承认
<1-20,Sheldon>I guess I just need to face it,

30
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,770
<1-20,Sheldon>我不再是少年神童
<1-20,Sheldon>I'm no longer a wunderkind.

31
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,770
<1-20,Sheldon>我现在只是少根筋 不知中午吃啥儿童
<1-20,Sheldon>Now I just wonder what's for lunch.

34
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,650
<1-21,Leonard>热狗
<1-21,Leonard>Hot dogs.

45
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,690
<2-1,Penny>我都不知道哺乳期可以喝酒
<2-1,Penny>I didn't know you could drink while you're breastfeeding.

46
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,530
<2-2,Bernadette>人家说啤酒里的酵母有助产奶
<2-2,Bernadette>Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.

47
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,530
<2-3,Amy>我敢说这是不实传闻 我查查
<2-3,Amy>I'm pretty sure that's a myth, let me check.

48
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,870
<2-4,Bernadette>查出来我不能喝 我就用这杯子打爆你头
<2-4,Bernadette>Ruin it for me and I'll break this glass over your head.

49
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,290
<2-5,Amy>敬自欺欺人一杯
<2-5,Amy>To denial.

50
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,460
<2-6,Penny>我去续杯
<2-6,Penny>Oh, I'm gonna get another.

51
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,500
<2-6,Penny>要吃的吗
<2-6,Penny>You want food?

52
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,460
<2-7,Bernadette>要 哺乳每天会消耗掉5000卡热量
<2-7,Bernadette>Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day.

53
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,920
<2-7,Bernadette>敢碰你手机试试
<2-7,Bernadette>Do not touch that phone.

54
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,010
<2-8,Zack>佩妮
<2-8,Zack>Penny?

00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,390
<2-10,Zack>得多巧啊 能在这里碰到你
<2-10,Zack>What are the odds of running into you here?

57
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,480
<2-11,Penny>这是间酒吧 所以不需要多巧
<2-11,Penny>Well, it's a bar, so pretty good.

58
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,640
<2-11,Penny>有何新鲜事
<2-11,Penny>Uh, what's new?

59

<2-12,Zack>挺多的呢
<2-12,Zack>Oh, tons of stuff.

60
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,860
<2-12,Zack>后院种了人工草皮 订了婚
<2-12,Zack>Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged,

61
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,320
<2-12,Zack>疑似皮肤癌的痣后来发现只是记号笔印迹
<2-12,Zack>had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.

62
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,360
<2-13,Penny>恭喜你啊
<2-13,Penny>Well, congratulations.

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,990
<2-14,Zack>我的皮肤科医生也这么说
<2-14,Zack>That's what my dermatologist said.

64
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,280
<2-15,Penny>是恭喜你订婚 太好了
<2-15,Penny>No, on-on getting engaged, good for you.

<2-16,Zack>谢谢 那你呢
<2-16,Zack>Oh, thanks. How about you?

66
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,120
<2-16,Zack>莱纳德最近好吗
<2-16,Zack>Hey, how's Leonard?

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,790
<2-16,Zack>还那么聪明吗
<2-16,Zack>Is he still smart?

68
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,790
<2-17,Penny>还好 还那么聪明 他正在为
<2-17,Penny>Yes, yes, he's working for the government

69
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,580
<2-17,Penny>政府研发无限持续陀螺仪
<2-17,Penny>on an infinite persistence gyroscope.

70
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,880
<2-17,Penny>果然 我第一次说正确
<2-17,Penny>Of course, the first time I say it right,

71
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,960
<2-17,Penny>他人就刚好不在
<2-17,Penny>he's not even here.

72
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,550
<2-18,Zack>我可喜欢这小个子了
<2-18,Zack>I love that little guy.

73
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,260
<2-18,Zack>或许我们该找一天一起吃饭
<2-18,Zack>Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.

74
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,430
<2-19,Penny>可以啊 我再问一下莱纳德
<2-19,Penny>Uh, yeah, sure, I'll check with Leonard.

75
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,010
<2-20,Zack>太好了 那我也问下莎拉
<2-20,Zack>Cool, I'll check with Sara.

76
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,480
<2-20,Zack>莎拉[Siri] 调出我的日程表
<2-20,Zack>Sara, pull up my calendar.

77
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,100
<2-20,Zack>这功能从来没好使过
<2-20,Zack>It never works for me.

78
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,240
<3-1,Sheldon>我一直在想我们这次遭人羞辱的事
<3-1,Sheldon>I've been thinking about our recent humiliation.

79
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,780
<3-2,Leonard>你得说得更详细才知道哪次
<3-2,Leonard>You're gonna have to be more specific.

80
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,450
<3-3,Sheldon>被孩子们羞辱
<3-3,Sheldon>At the hands of those teenagers.

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
<3-4,Leonard>还不够详细
<3-4,Leonard>More.

82
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,500
<3-5,Sheldon>被少年们羞辱
<3-5,Sheldon>Boy teenagers.

83
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,370
<3-6,Leonard>电玩啊 是啊 太惨了
<3-6,Leonard>Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.

84
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,380
<3-7,Sheldon>我开始去阅读一些有关认知活力的文章
<3-7,Sheldon>I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality,

85
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,170
<3-7,Sheldon>读到了一个有关“青春永驻”的研究领域
<3-7,Sheldon>and I came across an area of research called "super-aging."

86
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,550
<3-8,Raj>你们知道谁青春永驻吗 珍妮弗·洛佩兹
<3-8,Raj>You know who's a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez.

87
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,180
<3-8,Raj>她的不老秘方到底是什么啊
<3-8,Raj>Like, what is her secret?

88
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,600
<3-9,Howard>这情况还真罕见
<3-9,Howard>Now, this is rare.

89
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,100
<3-9,Howard>我不知道自己想先让你们俩哪个闭嘴
<3-9,Howard>I don't know which one of you I want to stop talking first.

90
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,310
<3-10,Sheldon>这理论是说如果你狠狠磨炼你的大脑
<3-10,Sheldon>The theory is that if you really tax your brain,

91
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,190
<3-10,Sheldon>脑神经纤维会变得更粗壮
<3-10,Sheldon>the neurofibers will become thicker

92
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,360
<3-10,Sheldon>神经胶质细胞更有光泽
<3-10,Sheldon>and the glial cells more lustrous.

93
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,070
<3-11,Raj>就像珍妮弗的秀发
<3-11,Raj>Like JLo's hair.

94
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,860
<3-12,Howard>两位 真的是不相上下啊
<3-12,Howard>Boy, it is neck and neck right now.

95
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,490
<3-13,Leonard>那保持青春永驻跟
<3-13,Leonard>How is super-aging any different

96
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,330
<3-13,Leonard>做填字游戏有什么区别
<3-13,Leonard>than, like, doing crossword puzzles?

97
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,370
<3-14,Sheldon>不再是做些简单的认知任务就行了
<3-14,Sheldon>Well, it's not just doing simple cognitive tasks.

98
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,620
<3-14,Sheldon>你得逼你的大脑走出原本的舒适区
<3-14,Sheldon>You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone

99
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,830
<3-14,Sheldon>再使其达到精神疲惫的状态
<3-14,Sheldon>and reach mental exhaustion.

100
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,080
<3-15,Leonard>我天天开车载你上班
<3-15,Leonard>I drive you to work every day,

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,300
<3-15,Leonard>我的大脑估计得强壮得像绿巨人
<3-15,Leonard>my brain must look like the Hulk.

102
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,340
<3-16,Raj>如果你真的想挑战自己极限
<3-16,Raj>If you really want to challenge yourself,

103
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,130
<3-16,Raj>你可以试着学印地语啊
<3-16,Raj>you could learn to speak Hindi.

104
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,010
<3-17,Sheldon>我八岁那年就学会了
<3-17,Sheldon>Jab mein aat saal ka tha Maine seekha tha.

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
<3-18,Raj>你能用英语说吗
<3-18,Raj>Could you say that in English?

106
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,640
<3-18,Raj>我其实从没学过印地语
<3-18,Raj>I actually, I never learned Hindi.

107
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,900
<4-1,Penny>你准备好出发了吗
<4-1,Penny>Hey, you ready to go?

108
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,360
<4-2,Leonard>大概吧
<4-2,Leonard>Yeah, I guess.

109
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,980
<4-3,Penny>怎么啦
<4-3,Penny>What's the matter?

110
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,440
<4-4,Leonard>说实话 跟你的前男友吃晚饭感觉有点怪
<4-4,Leonard>Honestly? It's a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend,

111
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,490
<4-4,Leonard>又不是我们有很多话可以聊
<4-4,Leonard>and it's not like we have a lot to talk about.

112
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,200
<4-5,Penny>干嘛 他超喜欢你好吗
<4-5,Penny>What? He loves you, okay?

113
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,700
<4-5,Penny>他对你的工作很感兴趣
<4-5,Penny>And he's interested in your work.

114
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,080
<4-5,Penny>你可以聊你的无限远景...
<4-5,Penny>You could talk about the infinite perspective...

115
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,210
<4-5,Penny>我发誓我真知道叫什么
<4-5,Penny>I swear I know it.

116
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,670
<4-6,Leonard>没事啦 我们走吧
<4-6,Leonard>It'll be fine, let's just go.

117
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,420
<4-7,Penny>而且他的未婚妻也会在 你懂吧
<4-7,Penny>Well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know,

118
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,130
<4-7,Penny>找不到话聊时 就可拟聊他们的婚礼
<4-7,Penny>if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.

119
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,960
<4-9,Penny>干嘛啦 上次坐飞机
<4-9,Penny>Come on, I spent an entire plane ride

120
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,510
<4-9,Penny>我-听你聊了整路的《死侍2》预告片
<4-9,Penny>with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.

121
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,090
<4-10,Leonard>我就知道你在装睡
<4-10,Leonard>Ha! I knew you weren't asleep.

122
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,430
<5-1,Zack>两位好呀
<5-1,Zack>Hey, guys.

123
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,430
<5-2,Penny>一你好  一你的未婚妻呢
<5-2,Penny>Hi. Hi. Hey, where's your fiancée?

124
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,730
<5-3,Zack>她来不了 她有急事
<5-3,Zack>Oh, she couldn't make it. She had an emergency.

125
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,270
<5-4,Penny>不会吧 发生什么事了
<5-4,Penny>Oh, no, what happened?

126
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,730
<5-5,Zack>我没问
<5-5,Zack>I didn't ask.

127
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,700
<6-3,Raj>什么东西那么香
<6-3,Raj>What smells so good?

128
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,450
<6-4,Amy>拉杰在教我做牛角包
<6-4,Amy>Raj is teaching me to make croissants.

129
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
<6-5,Sheldon>这是你保持大脑青春永驻的方式之一吗
<6-5,Sheldon>Is this part of your super-aging?

130
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,120
<6-6,Amy>没错 一开始我觉得会很难
<6-6,Amy>Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first,

131
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,040
<6-7,Sheldon>但之后发现
<6-7,Sheldon>but then I realized,

132
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,210
<6-7,Sheldon>这跟我小时候家里的化学实验装置一样
<6-7,Sheldon>it's like the chemistry set I had as a kid.

133
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,460
<6-7,Sheldon>区别在于 当你哥哥吃掉这个后
<6-7,Sheldon>Only, when your brother eats this,

134
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,130
<6-7,Sheldon>没人需要打电话给中毒控制中心
<6-7,Sheldon>no one has to call Poison Control.

135
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,210
<6-7,Sheldon>好了
<6-7,Sheldon>Okay.

136
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,960
<6-8,Raj>尝尝吧
<6-8,Raj>Shall we?

137
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,550
<6-8,Raj>天啊
<6-8,Raj>Oh, my God.

138
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,220
<6-8,Raj>既脆又酥 充满牛油香味
<6-8,Raj>It's light, it's flaky, it's buttery.

139
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,100
<6-8,Raj>你不用跟他滚床单 吃个牛角包就能高潮了
<6-8,Raj>You don't need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.

140
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,520
<6-9,Sheldon>是啊 确实很好吃
<6-9,Sheldon>Yes, it is delicious.

141
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,730
<6-9,Sheldon>不过 物理学家 面包师 爱人
<6-9,Sheldon>Wha... Physicist, baker, lover,

142
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,940
<6-9,Sheldon>世间哪有我做不到的事啊
<6-9,Sheldon>what can't I do?

143
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,150
<6-10,Amy>显然只做脑力劳动还不够
<6-10,Amy>Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough.

144
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,240
<6-10,Amy>也许你还得挑战一下运动技能
<6-10,Amy>Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.

145
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,660
<6-11,Sheldon>我再说最后一遍 我不会跟你来挠痒痒大战
<6-11,Sheldon>For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.

146
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,040
<6-12,Raj>你想来个真正的挑战吗
<6-12,Raj>You want a real challenge,

147
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,370
<6-12,Raj>试试阻止我继续吃牛角包啊
<6-12,Raj>try keeping me from eating more of these.

148
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,210
<6-13,Sheldon>你只是在利用食物掩饰内心
<6-13,Sheldon>You're just using food

149
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,250
<6-13,Sheldon>觉得自己不会有人爱
<6-13,Sheldon>to mask the fear that you're fundamentally unlovable

150
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,010
<6-13,Sheldon>注定孤独终老的恐惧
<6-13,Sheldon>and therefore going to be alone forever.

151
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,130
<6-14,Raj>我靠 他连这个也那么强
<6-14,Raj>Damn it, he's good at that, too.

152
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,260
<6-14,Raj>谢谢
<6-14,Raj>Thanks.

153
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,180
<7-1,Zack>为政府研发最高机密的项目
<7-1,Zack>Wow, working on a top secret government project,

154
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,890
<7-1,Zack>那真是太酷了
<7-1,Zack>that is so cool. Aw.

155
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,810
<7-1,Zack>你有保镖帮你吓跑间谍吗
<7-1,Zack>Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?

156
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,020
<7-2,Leonard>我有谢尔顿 他能吓跑大部分人
<7-2,Leonard>I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,730
<7-3,Zack>我想念那个小哥
<7-3,Zack>I miss that guy.

158
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,570
<7-3,Zack>他就像《大青蛙布偶秀》的瑞典厨师
<7-3,Zack>He's like the Swedish Chef Muppet.

159
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,860
<7-3,Zack>我听不懂他都在说些什么 但他很搞笑
<7-3,Zack>I don't know what he's saying, but he's funny.

160
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,620
<7-4,Leonard>我倒是知道他在说些什么 他绝对不搞笑
<7-4,Leonard>Oh, I know what he's saying, and he's not, he's not funny.

161
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,790
<7-5,Zack>佩妮 你最近怎么样
<7-5,Zack>So, Penny, what's going on with you?

162
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,790
<7-5,Zack>工作还顺利吗
<7-5,Zack>How's the job?

163
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,290
<7-6,Penny>还不错 我还在做医药销售
<7-6,Penny>Uh, it's okay, I'm still in pharmaceutical sales.

164
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,750
<7-7,Leonard>她可棒了
<7-7,Leonard>She's doing amazing.

165
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,460
<7-7,Leonard>她能把有10％可能性
<7-7,Leonard>She can actually make a side effect,

166
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,550
<7-7,Leonard>会出现肝功能衰竭的副作用
<7-7,Leonard>like 10% chance of liver failure,

167
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,800
<7-7,Leonard>说成有90％可能性能令肝脏恢复正常
<7-7,Leonard>sound like a 90% chance of liver success.

168
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,090
<7-8,Penny>说谎不是我这份工作值得骄傲的方面
<7-8,Penny>Yeah, lying isn't my favorite part of the job.

169
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,260
<7-8,Penny>事实上 很多方面我都不满意
<7-8,Penny>Actually, I'm not crazy about a lot of it.

170
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,760
<7-9,Zack>如果你不喜欢那份工作
<7-9,Zack>Hey, if you're not happy there, I've been looking

171
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,430
<7-9,Zack>我公司正想请个新的销售主管
<7-9,Zack>for a new head of sales at my company.

172
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,770
<7-9,Zack>我们不卖药 只卖菜单
<7-9,Zack>And we don't sell drugs, just menus,

173
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,940
<7-9,Zack>所以你唯一要说的谎是
<7-9,Zack>so the only lie you'll be telling

174
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,810
<7-9,Zack>我们用再生纸印菜单
<7-9,Zack>is we print on recycled paper.

175
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,320
<7-9,Zack>其实不是
<7-9,Zack>We don't.

176
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,360
<7-10,Penny>这工作邀请不错
<7-10,Penny>Oh, that's a nice offer.

177
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,910
<7-11,Zack>我们一定会合作无间
<7-11,Zack>You know, we'd make a great team.

178
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,780
<7-11,Zack>或者用我们菜单界的话来说
<7-11,Zack>Or as we say in the menu business,

179
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,790
<7-11,Zack>“你我做菜 永不孤单”
<7-11,Zack>I can't do this without "Me N U."

180
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,790
<7-12,Penny>懂了 因为结尾就是“菜单”
<7-12,Penny>Right, 'cause it spells "menu."

181
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,120
<7-13,Zack>多幽默啊 我有很多关于菜单的笑话
<7-13,Zack>Yeah, right? It's funny. I got a lot of menu jokes,

182
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,960
<7-13,Zack>但我最喜欢这个
<7-13,Zack>but that's my favorite.

183
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,380
<8-1,Howard>好啦 道具都在这儿了
<8-1,Howard>All right, this is everything.

184
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,840
<8-1,Howard>你想要学哪样
<8-1,Howard>What do you want to learn?

185
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,010
<8-2,Sheldon>其实都无所谓 只要能挑战自我就行了
<8-2,Sheldon>It really doesn't matter, as long as it's challenging.

186
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,980
<8-3,Howard>好吧 不如我教你几招
<8-3,Howard>Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you

187
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,310
<8-3,Howard>近景魔术
<8-3,Howard>some close-up... magic.

188
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,860
<8-4,Sheldon>霍华德 我是想让自己难受
<8-4,Sheldon>Howard, I'm trying to make myself uncomfortable,

189
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,400
<8-4,Sheldon>不是想祸害其他人
<8-4,Sheldon>not everyone else.

190
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,860
<8-5,Bernadette>你想学点考验体能的
<8-5,Bernadette>So you wanted to learn something physical

191
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,240
<8-5,Bernadette>却来找霍华德·沃罗威茨吗
<8-5,Bernadette>and you came to Howard Wolowitz?

192
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,540
<8-6,Howard>马戏艺术对于体能和心理素质都有很高的要求
<8-6,Howard>Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding.

193
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,000
<8-6,Howard>你试过玩抛接球吗
<8-6,Howard>Have you ever tried to juggle?

194
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,750
<8-7,Bernadette>试过 我现在就在挣扎
<8-7,Bernadette>Yes, I'm juggling my love for you

195
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,130
<8-7,Bernadette>该“抛”弃对你的爱 还是“接”住对你的嫌弃
<8-7,Bernadette>and my embarrassment of you right now.

196
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,840
<8-8,Howard>挺难的 不是吗
<8-8,Howard>And it's hard, isn't it?

197
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,630
<8-8,Howard>关键技巧在于
<8-8,Howard>So the key is,

198
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,430
<8-8,Howard>当一个球升到最高点时
<8-8,Howard>the moment one ball is at the top of its arc,

199
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,550
<8-8,Howard>你再抛出下一个
<8-8,Howard>you toss the next one.

200
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,140
<8-9,Sheldon>好 我应该学会了
<8-9,Sheldon>Hmm? Okay, I think I got that.

201
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,430
<8-10,Howard>且慢
<8-10,Howard>Uh, h-hold on.

202
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,140
<8-10,Howard>抛接球界有句老话
<8-10,Howard>There's a, an old saying in juggling.

203
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,150
<8-11,Bernadette>是“我注定孤独终老“吗
<8-11,Bernadette>Is it "I'm going to die alone"?

204
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,110
<8-12,Howard>非也 是“万丈高楼平地起 欢喜抛接一颗起”
<8-12,Howard>No, it's "if you want to have fun, start with one."

205
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,740
<8-12,Howard>你那句我们心里明白 但不会说出来
<8-12,Howard>Yours we think, but we do not say.

206
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,370
<8-12,Howard>好了 你先抛接几次
<8-12,Howard>All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times,

207
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,580
<8-12,Howard>熟悉一下感觉
<8-12,Howard>get comfortable with it.

208
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,200
<8-12,Howard>好的
<8-12,Howard>Okay.

209
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,830
<8-13,Sheldon>出于安全考量 问一下
<8-13,Sheldon>Just to be on the safe side,

210
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,250
<8-13,Sheldon>我会不会得“抛接肘”这类的运动伤害
<8-13,Sheldon>am I in any danger of getting juggler's elbow?

211
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,960
<8-14,Howard>不会
<8-14,Howard>No.

212
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,970
<8-15,Sheldon>你确定吗 我开始感觉到刺痛了
<8-15,Sheldon>Are you sure? 'Cause I'm feeling a twinge.

213
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,470
<9-1,Penny>你看 刚才不算太糟吧
<9-1,Penny>See, that wasn't so bad.

214
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,770
<9-1,Penny>他还付了饭钱呢
<9-1,Penny>He even picked up the check.

215
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,600
<14-8,Penny>是啊
<14-8,Penny>Yeah.

216
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,140
<9-2,Leonard>不过他计算小费该给多少时
<9-2,Leonard>Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip,

217
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,810
<9-2,Leonard>我看到他算到耳朵都冒烟了
<9-2,Leonard>I'm pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears.

218
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,400
<9-2,Leonard>你不是真的考虑去他公司上班吧
<9-2,Leonard>You're not really considering working for him, are you?

219
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,990
<9-3,Penny>有可能啊 那职位挺适合的
<9-3,Penny>Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect.

220
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,610
<9-3,Penny>我有销售经验
<9-3,Penny>I have sales experience,

221
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,910
<9-3,Penny>还当过服务员 所以也有餐厅相关经验
<9-3,Penny>and I've been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience,

222
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,200
<9-3,Penny>而且如果是由他来计算我的圣诞奖金
<9-3,Penny>and if he's figuring out my Christmas bonus,

223
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,830
<9-3,Penny>说不定我们能买艘船呢
<9-3,Penny>we could buy a boat.

224
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
<9-4,Leonard>你不觉得为前任打工
<9-4,Leonard>Don't you think it might be a little weird

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,960
<9-4,Leonard>有点怪吗
<9-4,Leonard>to work for someone you used to date?

226
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,460
<9-5,Penny>你和谢尔顿共事 你说呢
<9-5,Penny>You work with Sheldon, you tell me.

227
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,460
<9-6,Leonard>是的 超级怪
<9-6,Leonard>Yeah, it's weird.

228
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,430
<9-7,Penny>我和扎克一起工作 你真的会吃醋吗
<9-7,Penny>Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?

229
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,470
<9-8,Leonard>我才不是吃醋呢 我只是觉得
<9-8,Leonard>No, no, I-I'm not jealous, I just think

230
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,770
<9-8,Leonard>你现在明明干得不错
<9-8,Leonard>you have got a good thing going where you are right now,

231
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,850
<9-8,Leonard>收入也很不错
<9-8,Leonard>and you make great money

232
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,730
<9-8,Leonard>也没和同事睡成一片
<9-8,Leonard>and you haven't slept with any of your coworkers.

233
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,980
<9-9,Penny>那你是宁愿我做一份不开心的工作了
<9-9,Penny>Great, so you want me to stay at a job I'm not happy at?

234
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,610
<9-11,Penny>你没事吧
<9-11,Penny>You okay?

235
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,450
<9-11,Penny>你的表情就和扎克算不出小费时一样
<9-11,Penny>You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.

236
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,740
<9-12,Leonard>我当然不希望你工作不开心
<9-12,Leonard>Of course I don't want you to be unhappy,

237
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,450
<9-12,Leonard>但我更希望你更明智一点
<9-12,Leonard>but I also want you to be smart,

238
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,120
<9-12,Leonard>为前男友打工显然不是明智之举
<9-12,Leonard>and working for an ex-boyfriend isn't very smart.

239
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,420
<9-12,Leonard>你不用停 慢慢减速 我自己跳车
<9-12,Leonard>You don't have to stop, just slow down, I'll jump out.

240
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,930
<10-1,Sheldon>艾米 快看 我在骑独轮车
<10-1,Sheldon>Amy, look, I'm on a unicycle!

241
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,890
<10-2,Amy>你是怎么从牛角包跳到独轮车上的
<10-2,Amy>How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?

242
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,140
<10-3,Sheldon>我抛接球时伤到自己了
<10-3,Sheldon>I hurt myself juggling.

243
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,190
<10-4,Amy>你从哪里找来这玩意的
<10-4,Amy>Where did you get it?

244
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,900
<10-5,Sheldon>霍华德说可以暂时借给我
<10-5,Sheldon>Howard said I could borrow it,

245
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,770
<10-5,Sheldon>博纳黛特让我永远别还了
<10-5,Sheldon>Bernadette said forever.

246
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,110
<10-6,Amy>你试过不靠绳子自己骑吗
<10-6,Amy>Have you tried letting go of the rope?

247
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,490
<10-7,Sheldon>你疯了吗 我骑的可是独轮车
<10-7,Sheldon>What, are you crazy? I'm on a unicycle.

248
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,610
<10-8,Amy>好吧 那你慢慢玩
<10-8,Amy>All right, well, have fun.

249
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,580
<10-9,Sheldon>等等 我需要有人帮我下来
<10-9,Sheldon>Wait, I need help getting down.

250
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,910
<10-10,Amy>你想要我怎么做
<10-10,Amy>Well, what do you want me to do?

251
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,870
<10-11,Sheldon>先把我们的床垫拖出来放在这里
<10-11,Sheldon>Drag out our mattress and put it over here,

252
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,580
<10-11,Sheldon>然后去走廊对面把他们的床垫拖过来
<10-11,Sheldon>then go across the hall, get their mattress

253
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,660
<10-11,Sheldon>放在上面
<10-11,Sheldon>and put it over here.

254
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,710
<10-11,Sheldon>但在做这些事之前
<10-11,Sheldon>But before you do any of that,

255
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,830
<10-11,Sheldon>快帮我挠一下鼻子
<10-11,Sheldon>scratch my nose.

256
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,380
<11-1,Howard>所以你说了她很蠢
<11-1,Howard>So you told her she was being dumb?

257
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,510
<11-2,Leonard>不 我说她做的不是明智之举
<11-2,Leonard>No, I told her she was being not smart.

258
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,810
<11-2,Leonard>这太蠢了
<11-2,Leonard>Which was dumb.

259
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,270
<11-3,Raj>你为什么要和他一起吃晚饭呢
<11-3,Raj>Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?

260
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,100
<11-4,Leonard>我们才刚说过啊 我蠢呗
<11-4,Leonard>We covered this, I'm dumb.

261
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,650
<11-4,Leonard>就算他是我的前男友 又如何呢
<11-4,Leonard>So he's my ex-boyfriend, who cares?

262
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,610
<11-4,Leonard>真不敢相信莱纳德如此缺乏安全感
<11-4,Leonard>I can't believe Leonard would be so insecure.

263
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,570
<12-1,Penny>真的吗
<12-1,Penny>Really?

264
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,160
<12-2,Bernadette>我觉得这事非常好理解呀
<12-2,Bernadette>I have no trouble believing that at all.

265
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,320
<12-3,Penny>扎克都已经订婚了
<12-3,Penny>And Zack's engaged.

266
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,580
<12-3,Penny>莱纳德根本没理由担心
<12-3,Penny>Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.

267
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,950
<12-4,Bernadette>我俩说的是同一个莱纳德吧
<12-4,Bernadette>We're talking about the same Leonard, right?

268
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,330
<13-1,Leonard>你觉得她为扎克工作没问题吗
<13-1,Leonard>So you think it's fine if she works for Zack?

269
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,630
<13-2,Howard>我不知道 也许吧
<13-2,Howard>I don't know, maybe.

270
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,420
<13-3,Raj>他的确是比莱纳德好看多了
<13-3,Raj>Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard.

271
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,630
<13-3,Raj>没错
<13-3,Raj>Yes,

272
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,430
<13-4,Howard>但她的历任老板中这样的人也不少
<13-4,Howard>but that's gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.

273
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,180
<13-5,Leonard>可她以前还跟扎克一起睡过
<13-5,Leonard>Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.

274
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,600
<13-6,Howard>就像我刚才说的...
<13-6,Howard>Again...

275
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,480
<14-1,Bernadette>我就不会让霍华德和他的前任一起工作
<14-1,Bernadette>I would never let Howard work with an ex.

276
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,520
<14-2,Penny>什么 你不相信他吗
<14-2,Penny>What, you wouldn't trust him?

277
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,230
<14-3,Bernadette>我是不相信他的前任
<14-3,Bernadette>I wouldn't trust her.

278
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,900
<14-3,Bernadette>我家华仔可是一条苗条性感的犹太小灰狗
<14-3,Bernadette>He's thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.

279
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,120
<14-4,Penny>是是是 那还真是最性感的一种狗呢
<14-4,Penny>Yeah, that-that is the sexiest dog.

280
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,660
<14-5,Bernadette>我想华仔也不会接受
<14-5,Bernadette>And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't take a job

281
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,200
<14-5,Bernadette>会让我不爽的工作
<14-5,Bernadette>I was uncomfortable with.

282
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,370
<14-6,Penny>一因为他很怕你吗  一怕得要死
<14-6,Penny>'Cause he's scared of you? Terrified.

283
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,290
<14-8,Penny>没错
<14-8,Penny>Yeah.

284
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,000
<15-1,Howard>我支持莱纳德 这样是不对的
<15-1,Howard>You know what? I'm with Leonard, this isn't cool.

285
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,830
<15-2,Leonard>谢谢
<15-2,Leonard>Thank you.

286
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,380
<15-3,Raj>我不同意
<15-3,Raj>I disagree.

287
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,670
<15-3,Raj>佩妮是一个独立而坚强的新女性
<15-3,Raj>Penny is a strong, independent woman.

288
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,220
<15-3,Raj>你越想掌控她 她反抗越强烈
<15-3,Raj>The more you try to control her, the more she'll push back.

289
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,590
<15-4,Leonard>所以你觉得没问题吗
<15-4,Leonard>So you think it's okay?

290
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,180
<15-5,Raj>不 她命中注定要抛弃你
<15-5,Raj>Oh, no, she's gonna leave you for someone,

291
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,010
<15-5,Raj>还不如早死早超生
<15-5,Raj>might as well get it over with.

292
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,980
<16-1,Amy>你在干什么呀
<16-1,Amy>What are you doing?

293
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,190
<16-2,Sheldon>我准备把这些东西都还给霍华德
<16-2,Sheldon>I'm returning this stuff to Howard.

294
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,110
<16-3,Amy>博纳黛特要我保证如果你不想玩了
<16-3,Amy>Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn't want it,

295
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,990
<16-3,Amy>就把它送给流浪的小丑
<16-3,Amy>we'd give it to a homeless clown.

296
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,820
<16-3,Amy>你怎么不继续学独轮车了
<16-3,Amy>What happened to learning the unicycle?

297
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,780
<16-4,Sheldon>我不想学了 太蠢了
<16-4,Sheldon>Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb.

298
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,990
<16-4,Sheldon>独轮 两轮 三轮 月经周期[轮]
<16-4,Sheldon>Uni, bi, tri, menstrual,

299
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,540
<16-4,Sheldon>带轮的东西都很蠢
<16-4,Sheldon>all cycles are dumb.

300
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,160
<16-5,Amy>你还说抛接球也很蠢呢
<16-5,Amy>You said juggling was dumb, too.

301
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,170
<16-6,Sheldon>的确蠢啊
<16-6,Sheldon>Well, it is.

302
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,460
<16-6,Sheldon>我想一次性拿住3个东西
<16-6,Sheldon>If I wanted to hold three things at once,

303
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,880
<16-6,Sheldon>穿条多口袋裤子就好啦
<16-6,Sheldon>I'd wear cargo pants.

304
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,800
<16-7,Amy>谢尔顿 有没有这种可能
<16-7,Amy>Sheldon, is it possible that

305
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,010
<16-7,Amy>每当事情变困难时
<16-7,Amy>when things get really difficult,

306
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,510
<16-7,Amy>你就放弃了
<16-7,Amy>you just give up?

307
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,760
<16-8,Sheldon>你在说我是半途而度的人吗
<16-8,Sheldon>Are you calling me a quitter?

308
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,930
<16-9,Amy>如果你凭良心...
<16-9,Amy>Well, if you honestly...

309
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,180
<16-10,Sheldon>对话到底为止
<16-10,Sheldon>This conversation is over.

310
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,850
<16-11,Amy>他的妈妈警告过我
<16-11,Amy>His mother warned me.

311
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,360
<16-11,Amy>每个人都警告过我
<16-11,Amy>Everybody warned me.

312
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,900
<16-11,Amy>说起来 他自己都警告过我
<16-11,Amy>Actually, he warned me.

313
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,200
<17-3,Penny>你想聊聊吗
<17-3,Penny>You want to talk?

314
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,500
<17-4,Leonard>这貌似不是我的强项
<17-4,Leonard>That doesn't seem to be where I shine.

315
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,040
<17-4,Leonard>不如让我给你点个赞吧
<17-4,Leonard>How about I just give you one of these?

316
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,050
<17-5,Penny>我们可以坐下来理性地谈一谈
<17-5,Penny>Look, we can have a reasonable conversation

317
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,010
<17-5,Penny>我保证不生气
<17-5,Penny>and I won't get mad.

318
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,010
<17-5,Penny>我在爱爱后不喜欢这手势 现在也不喜欢
<17-5,Penny>I don't like it after sex, and I don't like it now.

319
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,350
<17-6,Leonard>一好吧 抱歉  一好
<17-6,Leonard>Yeah, sorry. Yeah.

320
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,480
<17-7,Penny>过来吧
<17-7,Penny>All right, just come here.

321
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,020
<17-7,Penny>我知道和扎克一起工作很奇怪
<17-7,Penny>Look, I get me working with Zack is weird

322
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,520
<17-7,Penny>我也不希望你心里不爽
<17-7,Penny>and I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

323
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,570
<17-8,Leonard>谢谢
<17-8,Leonard>Well, thanks.

324
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,650
<17-8,Leonard>我也不想让你干不喜欢的工作
<17-8,Leonard>And I don't want you to be stuck at a job you don't like.

325
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,070
<17-9,Penny>那我们怎么办呢
<17-9,Penny>Then what do we do?

326
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,990
<17-10,Leonard>虽然我不高兴 但如果你真的想要这份工作
<17-10,Leonard>Well, I don't love it, but if you really want to take this job,

327
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,700
<17-10,Leonard>我会试着接受这件事
<17-10,Leonard>I'll find a way to deal with it.

328
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,120
<17-11,Penny>我知道你会试 但这会让你很郁闷
<17-11,Penny>No, I know you'll try, but it'll make you miserable,

329
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,910
<17-11,Penny>然后我也会很郁闷 所以...
<17-11,Penny>which will make me miserable, and...

330
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,710
<17-11,Penny>我还是不要换工作了
<17-11,Penny>I'm just gonna stay where I'm at for now.

331
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,670
<17-12,Leonard>不不不 你做得不开心
<17-12,Leonard>No, no, no, no, you're-you're unhappy there

332
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,540
<17-12,Leonard>反而会怪是我让你留下的
<17-12,Leonard>and then you're gonna blame me for making you stay,

333
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,500
<17-12,Leonard>别管我 我忍就是了
<17-12,Leonard>and it's fine, I'll just-- I'll suck it up.

334
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,460
<17-13,Penny>你真的不用这么做 没关系
<17-13,Penny>You don't need to do that, it's okay.

335
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,630
<17-14,Leonard>现在我不好受了
<17-14,Leonard>Yeah, see, now I feel terrible,

336
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,510
<17-14,Leonard>好像我太自私 拖了你的后腿
<17-14,Leonard>like I'm being selfish and holding you back.

337
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,640
<17-14,Leonard>怎么了 说话啊
<17-14,Leonard>What? Say something.

338
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,730
<17-14,Leonard>这手势的确挺让人不爽的
<17-14,Leonard>Yeah, that is pretty annoying.

339
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,240
<18-1,Amy>我给你泡了茶
<18-1,Amy>I made you tea.

340
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,280
<18-2,Sheldon>谢谢
<18-2,Sheldon>Thank you.

341
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,860
<18-3,Amy>抱歉我说你半途而废
<18-3,Amy>I'm sorry I called you a quitter.

342
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,080
<18-4,Sheldon>没事 我已经不生气了
<18-4,Sheldon>It's okay, I stopped being upset about that.

343
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,450
<18-4,Sheldon>对 我知道我没坚持生气挺能证明你的观点
<18-4,Sheldon>And no, the irony is not lost on me.

344
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,210
<18-5,Amy>你在看什么
<18-5,Amy>What are you reading?

345
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,460
<18-6,Sheldon>这文章说诺贝尔获奖者
<18-6,Sheldon>This article says the peak age for making

346
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,960
<18-6,Sheldon>取得大发现的巅峰年纪是40岁
<18-6,Sheldon>a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.

347
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,040
<18-7,Amy>那又怎样
<18-7,Amy>So?

348
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,800
<18-8,Sheldon>我没多少时间了
<18-8,Sheldon>So I'm running out of time.

349
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,220
<18-9,Amy>太荒唐了 你是个超级有才气的人
<18-9,Amy>That's ridiculous, you're a brilliant man.

350
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,590
<18-9,Amy>你人生的大好年华还在眼前
<18-9,Amy>The best years of your life are still ahead of you.

351
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,930
<18-10,Sheldon>你必须这么说 你爱我
<18-10,Sheldon>Oh, you have to say that, you're sweet on me.

352
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,640
<18-11,Amy>如果你真的为事业担心
<18-11,Amy>Well, if you're really worried about your career,

353
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,600
<18-11,Amy>也许你应该考虑少花些时间
<18-11,Amy>maybe you should consider spending a little less time

354
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,270
<18-11,Amy>在电玩和漫画书上
<18-11,Amy>with video games and comic books.

355
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,820
<18-12,Sheldon>你不是爱我的吗
<18-12,Sheldon>I thought you were sweet on me.

356
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,110
<18-13,Amy>好吧 假设你这辈子没有赢得诺贝尔奖
<18-13,Amy>Okay, fine, let's say you never win a Nobel Prize.

357
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,240
<18-13,Amy>假设你这辈子一直在做踏实的科学研究
<18-13,Amy>Let's say you spend your life doing solid scientific research

358
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,820
<18-13,Amy>你身边全是朋友和爱你的人
<18-13,Amy>surrounded by friends and loved ones

359
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,320
<18-13,Amy>他们欣赏你
<18-13,Amy>who appreciate you,

360
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,700
<18-13,Amy>不是因为你的成就
<18-13,Amy>not for what you've accomplished

361
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,830
<18-13,Amy>而是因为你这个人
<18-13,Amy>but for who you are as a man.

362
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,370
<18-13,Amy>不也就不枉此生了吗
<18-13,Amy>Wouldn't that be a life well-lived?

363
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,750
<18-14,Sheldon>你真可爱
<18-14,Sheldon>You're so cute.

364
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,960
<18-14,Sheldon>我要去学踩高跷
<18-14,Sheldon>I'm gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.

365
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,590
<18-15,Amy>那么多警告 全当耳边风
<18-15,Amy>So many warnings.

366
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,350
<19-1,Penny>你确定吗
<19-1,Penny>Okay, are you sure about this?

367
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,810
<19-2,Leonard>当然确定 我只希望你开心
<19-2,Leonard>Absolutely. I just want you to be happy.

368
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,640
<19-2,Leonard>最好我的无私能令你有点小性奋
<19-2,Leonard>And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I'm being.

369
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,230
<19-3,Zack (on phone)>佩妮 什么事
<19-3,Zack (on phone)>Penny, what's up?

370
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,650
<19-4,Penny>我考虑过了
<19-4,Penny>Hey, uh, so I've been thinking about it

371
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,440
<19-4,Penny>我想接受这份工作
<19-4,Penny>and I want to take the job.

372
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,700
<19-5,Zack>坏消息
<19-5,Zack>Oh, bad news.

373
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,780
<19-5,Zack>我未婚妻发现我给前女友
<19-5,Zack>When my fiancée found out that I was offering a job

374
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,280
<19-5,Zack>提供工作 她说这样做很蠢
<19-5,Zack>to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea

375
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,330
<19-5,Zack>还扔鞋子砸我
<19-5,Zack>and threw a shoe at me.

376
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,870
<19-6,Penny>那么没工作吗
<19-6,Penny>Oh, so there's no job?

377
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,960
<19-7,Zack>没 唯一有的是我额头上的包
<19-7,Zack>Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.

378
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,800
<19-8,Penny>好吧 还是谢谢了
<19-8,Penny>Okay, thanks anyway.

379
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,630
<19-8,Penny>拜
<19-8,Penny>Bye.

380
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,010
<19-8,Penny>他未婚妻觉得
<19-8,Penny>Well, his fiancée thought

381
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,050
<19-8,Penny>一起工作是件愚蠢的事
<19-8,Penny>the idea of us working together was stupid.

382
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,970
<19-8,Penny>你是对的 我错了
<19-8,Penny>You were right, I was wrong.

383
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,310
<19-8,Penny>你不打算说什么吗
<19-8,Penny>Aren't you gonna say anything?

384
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,650
<19-9,Leonard>无需多言 我只想做这个手势
<19-9,Leonard>Not if I want to be doing this later.

385
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,320
<20-1,Bernadette>我不知道你在家
<20-1,Bernadette>Hey, I didn't know you were home.

386
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,530
<20-1,Bernadette>你去哪里了
<20-1,Bernadette>Where you been?

387
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,570
<20-2,Howard>我去见你妈妈了
<20-2,Howard>I went to see your mom.

388
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,830
<20-3,Bernadette>说真的 你去了哪里
<20-3,Bernadette>Seriously, where were you?

389
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,540
<20-4,Howard>我刚说了 你妈妈家
<20-4,Howard>I just told you, your mom's.

390
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,660
<20-5,Bernadette>为什么
<20-5,Bernadette>Why?

391
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,580
<20-6,Howard>因为你极度鄙视我的魔术
<20-6,Howard>Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing,

392
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,290
<20-6,Howard>我想知道
<20-6,Howard>I got to wondering

393
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,800
<20-6,Howard>你小时候有什么酷爱好
<20-6,Howard>what cool hobbies you had as a kid.

394
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,800
<20-7,Bernadette>她说了什么
<20-7,Bernadette>What'd she say?

395
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,550
<20-8,Howard>你妈没说什么
<20-8,Howard>She didn't say much of anything.

396
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,850
<20-8,Howard>但她说了很多
<20-8,Howard>But she said a lot!

397
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,020
<20-8,Howard>伯纳黛特 还记得我吗
<20-8,Howard>Hi, Bernadette, remember me?

398
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,610
<20-9,Bernadette>首先 她不是这样说话的
<20-9,Bernadette>First of all, that's not what she sounds like,

399
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,690
<20-9,Bernadette>人家来自南卡罗来纳州
<20-9,Bernadette>she's from South Carolina.

400
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,650
<20-10,Howard>真不敢相信你嘲笑了我这么多年
<20-10,Howard>I can't believe you made fun of me

401
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,780
<20-10,Howard>你自己却是个深柜腹语者
<20-10,Howard>all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.

402
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,240
<20-11,Bernadette>不是我自愿想成为腹语者
<20-11,Bernadette>Okay, it's not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist.

403
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,500
<20-11,Bernadette>我当时参加选美 我需要一项才艺
<20-11,Bernadette>I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent

404
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,660
<20-11,Bernadette>不能光靠散播谣言
<20-11,Bernadette>besides spreading rumors

405
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,710
<20-11,Bernadette>说其他参赛者怀孕了
<20-11,Bernadette>that the other contestants were pregnant.

406
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,590
<20-12,Howard>既然你很享受
<20-12,Howard>Well, since you enjoyed

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,050
<20-12,Howard>扔掉我的东西
<20-12,Howard>getting rid of all my stuff, you know,

408
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,630
<20-12,Howard>也许我们应该把这位小姑娘扔进碎木机
<20-12,Howard>maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.

409
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,130
<20-12,Howard>不
<20-12,Howard>No!

410
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,300
<20-13,Bernadette>这位小姑娘有名字的
<20-13,Bernadette>And the little lady has a name.

411
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,510
<20-14,Howard>叫什么
<20-14,Howard>Which is?

412

<20-15,Bernadette>"Tammy Jo St. Cloud."

414
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,480
<20-16,Howard>而我玩抛接球就被笑是死宅
<20-16,Howard>Oh, and I'm a dork for juggling.

415
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,190
<20-17,Bernadette>对不起 你不是死宅男
<20-17,Bernadette>Sorry, you're not a dork.

<20-15,Bernadette>黛咪·乔 别这样说
<20-15,Bernadette>Tammy Jo, don't say that,

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,070
<20-17,Bernadette>他会感到难受的
<20-17,Bernadette>you'll make him feel bad.

419
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,070
<20-17,Bernadette>看他
<20-17,Bernadette>Look at him,

420
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,250
<20-17,Bernadette>他凭什么自我感觉良好
<20-17,Bernadette>what reason he got to feel good?

421
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,080
<20-18,Howard>好了 非常好笑
<20-18,Howard>All right, very funny.

<20-19,Bernadette>别听她的
<20-19,Bernadette>Don't listen to her,

423
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,500
<20-19,Bernadette>她被关在盒子里25年了
<20-19,Bernadette>she's been in a box for, like, 25 years.

424
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,590
<20-19,Bernadette>对 我被关之前他的发型还很流行呢
<20-19,Bernadette>Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,050
<20-20,Howard>够了 把她拿开
<20-20,Howard>That's enough, put her away.

<20-21,Bernadette (as Doll)>老爹爹
<20-21,Bernadette (as Doll)>Oh, big daddy,

<20-21,Bernadette (as Doll)>你娶了妮妮小姐 就是娶了我
<20-21,Bernadette (as Doll)>You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me.
