1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,130
<1-1,Amy>我从没见过他这么欢乐
<1-1,Amy>I've never seen him this happy before.

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,190
<1-1,Amy>那是因为你从来没有在
<1-1,Amy>That's because you've never seen him

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,820
<1-2,Leonard>"医药箱补货日"见过他

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,400
<1-5,Sheldon>那不是质子教授吗
<1-5,Sheldon>Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?

<1-7,Sheldon>你们看他  像普通人一样排队
<1-7,Sheldon>Look at him, just standing in line

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,540
<1-7,Sheldon>好像自己30年前并不是个二流名人似地
<1-7,Sheldon>like he wasn't moderately famous 30 years ago.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,320
<1-7,Sheldon>去跟他打招呼吧
<1-7,Sheldon>Let's go say hello.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,370
<1-8,Leonard>我们还是别烦人家比较好吧
<1-8,Leonard>Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,990
<1-9,Sheldon>我没有要去烦他啊  我是要去跟他聊聊
<1-9,Sheldon>I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,640
<1-10,Leonard>他总以为这两者不一样
<1-10,Leonard>He thinks there's a difference.

00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,420
<1-11,Sheldon>你可能因为年事已高忘了我是谁了
<1-11,Sheldon>You may not remember because of your advanced age.

21

<1-15,Amy>而且你看  我们穿着同款矫正鞋呢
<1-15,Amy>Hey look-- we're wearing the same orthopedic shoes.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,940
<1-15,Amy>真不敢相信我跟名人穿同样的鞋
<1-15,Amy>I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.

30
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,850
<1-16,Arthur>现在我明白了
<1-16,Arthur>O-Okay, I get it now.

<1-21,Leonard>-谢尔顿  -别说  让我猜猜
<1-21,Leonard>- Sheldon. - Wait, I want to guess.

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,550
<1-22,Sheldon>别告诉我答案
<1-22,Sheldon>Don't tell me.

38
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,350
<1-23,Arthur>我本来就没打算告诉你
<1-23,Arthur>I wasn't going to tell you.

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,810
<1-24,Amy>谢尔顿  别玩了
<1-24,Amy>Sheldon, come on.

<1-25,Sheldon>好  给我的提示
<1-25,Sheldon>All right, give me a hint.

42
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,940
<1-25,Sheldon>是不是跟排某些液体有困难有关
<1-25,Sheldon>Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,930
<1-26,Arthur>看我的年纪就知道  猜中很容易吧
<1-26,Arthur>Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess.

44
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,620
<1-27,Leonard>谢尔顿  我们还是去取笑
<1-27,Leonard>Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,140
<2-7,Howard>你知道她们是要串珠宝的对吧
<2-7,Howard>You know they're making jewelry, right?

63
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,510
<2-8,Raj>你以为那主意是她们想出来的吗
<2-8,Raj>You think they came up with that?

64
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,630
<2-8,Raj>她们本来是要喝啤酒  射飞镖好吗
<2-8,Raj>They were going to drink beer and play darts.

<2-9,Leonard>怎么样啦[什么上升]
<2-9,Leonard>What's up?

66
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,070
<2-10,Howard>绝对不是他的睾丸酮水平
<2-10,Howard>Not his testosterone levels.

67
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,020
<2-11,Raj>别乱说
<2-11,Raj>Excuse me.

68
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,120
<2-11,Raj>人家对自己的男子气概很满意好咩
<2-11,Raj>I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,480
<2-12,Howard>这怎么可能
<2-12,Howard>How is that possible?

70
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,810
<2-13,Leonard>质子教授给我发了电邮
<2-13,Leonard>Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.

71
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,320
<2-14,Sheldon>好耶  他说什么了
<2-14,Sheldon>Goody! What's it say?

72
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,140
<2-15,Leonard>他在写一篇纳米真空管的论文
<2-15,Leonard>He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes,

73
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,620
<2-15,Leonard>问我能不能帮他看看
<2-15,Leonard>and wants to know if I'd take a look at it.

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,550
<2-16,Sheldon>奇怪
<2-16,Sheldon>That's strange.

75
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,250
<2-16,Sheldon>他居然会找你  而不是找我帮忙
<2-16,Sheldon>That he would come to you for that and not me.

76
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,900
<2-16,Sheldon>我收到他两封电邮呢
<2-16,Sheldon>Oh, I got two emails from him.

77
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,720
<2-16,Sheldon>"你有莱纳德的邮箱吗"
<2-16,Sheldon>"Do you have Leonard's email address?"

78
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,610
<2-16,Sheldon>还有
<2-16,Sheldon>And...

79
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,300
<2-16,Sheldon>"不用了  我找到了"
<2-16,Sheldon>"Never mind, I found it."

80
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,190
<2-16,Sheldon>他居然会选你不选我
<2-16,Sheldon>I can't believe he picked you over me.

81
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,500
<2-17,Howard>你也不会想看一篇好几十年没正经
<2-17,Howard>You don't want to read a paper by some old has-been

82
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,860
<2-17,Howard>搞过科研的过气老头写的论文呢
<2-17,Howard>who hasn't done any real science in decades.

83
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,740
<2-18,Raj>这有什么好哭诉的
<2-18,Raj>Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,350
<2-19,Sheldon>谢尔顿·库伯才不哭呢
<2-19,Sheldon>Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

85
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,920
<2-20,Howard>有道理  你个机器人碰水会生锈
<2-20,Howard>It's true, you'd rust.

86
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,620
<3-1,Sheldon>想到我居然曾经当他是我偶像
<3-1,Sheldon>And to think I idolized that man.

87
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,980
<3-1,Sheldon>我何苦呢
<3-1,Sheldon>And why?

88
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,050
<3-1,Sheldon>说到底  他不过也是个好莱坞伪君子罢了
<3-1,Sheldon>At the end of the day he's just another Hollywood phony.

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,320
<3-2,Amy>这事情真的值得你不开心吗
<3-2,Amy>Is it really worth getting upset about?

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,210
<3-3,Sheldon>常言道  别见你心中的英雄
<3-3,Sheldon>They say don't meet your heroes.

91
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,210
<3-3,Sheldon>不要窥探他们名望与名声背后的真实
<3-3,Sheldon>Don't peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity,

92
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,090
<3-3,Sheldon>如果你犯了这禁忌  你会看到真实的他们
<3-3,Sheldon>because if you do, you'll see them as they really are--

93
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,370
<3-3,Sheldon>堕落的卖笑戏子
<3-3,Sheldon>degenerate carnival folk.

94
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,330
<3-4,Amy>别这样  他只是个退休的儿童节目主持
<3-4,Amy>Come on, he's a retired kids show host.

95
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,500
<3-5,Sheldon>这才更糟呢
<3-5,Sheldon>That's even worse.

96
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,710
<3-5,Sheldon>用美好的科学当糖果
<3-5,Sheldon>Using the sweet candy of science

97
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,830
<3-5,Sheldon>骗取小孩对他的爱慕
<3-5,Sheldon>to trick children into loving him.

98
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,440
<3-5,Sheldon>死淫贼
<3-5,Sheldon>Pervert.

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,270
<3-6,Amy>你有仔细想过
<3-6,Amy>Have you ever thought about

100
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,000
<3-6,Amy>为什么亚瑟没找你读论文吗
<3-6,Amy>why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?

101
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,410
<3-7,Sheldon>我想过
<3-7,Sheldon>Yes, I have.

102
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,740
<3-7,Sheldon>我唯一的结论就是
<3-7,Sheldon>And my only conclusion

103
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,610
<3-7,Sheldon>他那天在药房买的药
<3-7,Sheldon>is the prescription he was picking up the other day

104
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,470
<3-7,Sheldon>是要治神经病的
<3-7,Sheldon>was for cuckoo pills.

105
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,020
<3-8,Amy>有可能是他觉得你有点过了吧
<3-8,Amy>Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.

106
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,360
<3-9,Sheldon>你这话说得才过吧
<3-9,Sheldon>That's kind of a stretch.

107
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,010
<3-9,Sheldon>要说社交技巧
<3-9,Sheldon>Look, when it comes to social skills,

108
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,460
<3-9,Sheldon>我已经掌握了三大技巧
<3-9,Sheldon>I've mastered the big three.

109
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,590
<3-9,Sheldon>首先是腼腆一笑
<3-9,Sheldon>There's the coy smile.

110
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,350
<3-9,Sheldon>以及友善的轻笑
<3-9,Sheldon>There's the friendly chuckle.

111
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,550
<3-9,Sheldon>以及如何发出同情音
<3-9,Sheldon>There's the vocalization of sympathy.

112
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,290
<3-9,Sheldon>最后这个太难了  我还在练
<3-9,Sheldon>That last one's tricky, I'm still working on it.

113
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,980
<3-10,Amy>就我那天看到的情况来看
<3-10,Amy>From what I saw the other day,

114
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,620
<3-10,Amy>我能理解他或...
<3-10,Amy>I could understand why he and...

115
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,800
<3-10,Amy>有些人可能会觉得你
<3-10,Amy>some people might find you...

116
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,980
<3-11,Sheldon>什么
<3-11,Sheldon>What?

117
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,040
<3-12,Amy>算了
<3-12,Amy>Doesn't matter.

118
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,130
<3-13,Sheldon>不行  快说
<3-13,Sheldon>No, go ahead, say it.

119
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,630
<3-13,Sheldon>我知道你想说什么
<3-13,Sheldon>I know what it is.

120
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,070
<3-13,Sheldon>我这辈子听过无数遍了
<3-13,Sheldon>I've heard it my whole life.

121
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,260
<3-13,Sheldon>你想说的是"惹人厌"
<3-13,Sheldon>The word's "annoying".

122
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,570
<3-13,Sheldon>说吧  说吧
<3-13,Sheldon>Go ahead, say it.

123
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,560
<3-14,Amy>快说  说我惹人厌
<3-14,Amy>Say it. Say I'm annoying.

124
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,280
<3-14,Amy>谢尔顿
<3-14,Amy>Sheldon...

125
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,900
<3-15,Sheldon>我才不会觉得受伤

134
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,390
<4-1,Amy>真有意思
<4-1,Amy>This is fun.

135
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,160
<4-1,Amy>我会像戴着珠宝的那种傲娇的贵妇
<4-1,Amy>I'm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewelry

136
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,220
<4-1,Amy>只不过我不会对一大堆药物过敏
<4-1,Amy>that doesn't have a list of medications I'm allergic to.

137
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,700
<4-2,Raj>佩妮  你做得怎么样
<4-2,Raj>Penny, how's it going over there?

138
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,660
<4-3,Penny>很好  只是我有点搞不定胶水
<4-3,Penny>Good-- I'm just having little trouble with the glue.

139
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,030
<4-4,Amy>你难道不会用胶水吗
<4-4,Amy>How do you not know how to use glue?

140
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,130
<4-4,Amy>你学前班老逃课了吧
<4-4,Amy>Did you ditch pre-school?

141
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,790
<4-5,Penny>是啊  当时我忙着跟二年级的学生约会呢
<4-5,Penny>Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.

142
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,600
<4-6,Howard>各位好啊
<4-6,Howard>Hello, everyone.

143
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,990
<4-7,Raj>好吧  你想说什么就说吧
<4-7,Raj>Okay, let me have it.

144
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,960
<4-7,Raj>你只管开"拉杰是娘们"的玩笑好了
<4-7,Raj>Let's hear all the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

145
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,620
<4-8,Howard>你想错了
<4-8,Howard>Nope.

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,310
<4-8,Howard>伯纳黛特说这样不对  她不许我这样
<4-8,Howard>Bernadette told me it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.

147
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,000
<4-9,Raj>那还真是多谢了
<4-9,Raj>Thank you.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,460
<4-10,Howard>所以我不会嘲笑你
<4-10,Howard>So I won't be making fun of you,

149
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,670
<4-10,Howard>也不会耻笑你喜欢的事物
<4-10,Howard>or the things you like,

150
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,080
<4-10,Howard>更不会讥笑你"只想玩乐"的事实
<4-10,Howard>or the fact that you just want to have fun.

152
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,440
<4-11,Bernadette>华仔  别说了
<4-11,Bernadette>Howie, stop.

153
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,290
<4-11,Bernadette>过来看看我做的东西
<4-11,Bernadette>Come on, look at what I'm making.

154
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
<4-12,Howard>还挺好看的嘛
<4-12,Howard>Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

155
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,720
<4-13,Amy>我在做手镯
<4-13,Amy>I'm making a bracelet.

156
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,860
<4-14,Penny>而我做的是"一团糟"
<4-14,Penny>Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

157
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,640
<4-15,Howard>你们其实可以拿我的焊铁玩
<4-15,Howard>You know, instead of beads and glue,

158
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,040
<4-15,Howard>而不是在这光玩珠子和胶水
<4-15,Howard>you guys can use my soldering iron.

159
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,840
<4-15,Howard>这样你们可以做更酷的东西
<4-15,Howard>You'd be able to make much cooler stuff.

160
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,410
<4-16,Raj>我觉得这样就挺好  谢啦
<4-16,Raj>Oh, I think we're doing just fine, thank you.

161
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,120
<4-17,Amy>-老实说  我想试试  -我也是
<4-17,Amy>- Actually, I'd kind of like to try that. - Me, too.

162
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,970
<4-19,Howard>马上给你们拿来
<4-19,Howard>Be right back.

163
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,240
<4-20,Penny>我胳膊上怎么黏有开心果
<4-20,Penny>When did I have pistachios?

164
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,670
<5-1,Sheldon>亚瑟
<5-1,Sheldon>Arthur.

165
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,380
<5-1,Sheldon>亚瑟
<5-1,Sheldon>Arthur.

166

<5-1,Sheldon>从那个电视节目赚的吧
<5-1,Sheldon>That's TV money.

170
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,430
<5-2,Arthur>谢尔顿  你来这儿干嘛
<5-2,Arthur>Sheldon, what are you doing here?

171
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,150
<5-3,Sheldon>抱歉  我吵醒你了吗
<5-3,Sheldon>I'm sorry, did I wake you?

172
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,790
<5-4,Arthur>当然啦  现在都晚上7点半了
<5-4,Arthur>Of course you woke me, it's 7:30.

173
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,550
<5-5,Sheldon>本来我可以早点到的
<5-5,Sheldon>Well, I would have been here sooner,

174
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,010
<5-5,Sheldon>但不知道为什么
<5-5,Sheldon>but for some reason your home

175
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,210
<5-5,Sheldon>你家不在"好莱坞明星之家"这幅地图上
<5-5,Sheldon>isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.

176
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,590
<5-6,Arthur>你找我有事吗  谢尔顿
<5-6,Arthur>What do you want, Sheldon?

177
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,610
<5-7,Sheldon>我的女朋友指出
<5-7,Sheldon>It's been pointed out by my girlfriend

178
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,140
<5-7,Sheldon>那天我可能惹到你了
<5-7,Sheldon>that I may have been annoying to you.

179
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,600
<5-8,Arthur>这么懂事的姑娘你可别放手
<5-8,Arthur>She sounds like a keeper.

180
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,300
<5-9,Sheldon>总之我想跟你道歉
<5-9,Sheldon>Anyway, I wanted to apologize.

181
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,770
<5-9,Sheldon>真的很对不起
<5-9,Sheldon>I am truly sorry.

182
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,970
<5-10,Arthur>好的  我接受你的道歉  晚安
<5-10,Arthur>All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.

183
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,750
<5-11,Sheldon>不  还有呢  既然我们冰释前嫌
<5-11,Sheldon>No, no, now that... we've cleared the air,

184
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,440
<5-11,Sheldon>我还想跟你商量一件事
<5-11,Sheldon>I wanted to discuss another matter with you.

185
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,140
<5-12,Arthur>谢尔顿  再过两个小时  我就得起床
<5-12,Arthur>Sheldon, in a couple hours, I have to get up,

186
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,470
<5-12,Arthur>尿个尿  然后在房子里游荡[梦游]
<5-12,Arthur>pee and then wander around the house.

187
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,060
<5-13,Sheldon>那我长话短说
<5-13,Sheldon>Well, then, I'll make this quick.

188
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,640
<5-13,Sheldon>我想跟你谈谈你发给莱纳德那篇论文
<5-13,Sheldon>Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard.

189
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,510
<5-13,Sheldon>我知道他说可行性很高
<5-13,Sheldon>Now, I know he said it's promising

190
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,400
<5-13,Sheldon>他也打算跟你合作
<5-13,Sheldon>and he's going to collaborate on it,

191
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,730
<5-13,Sheldon>但现在我们又是朋友了
<5-13,Sheldon>but now that you and I are friends again,

192
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,360
<5-13,Sheldon>我随时听候您差遣
<5-13,Sheldon>I am at your disposal.

193
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,380
<5-13,Sheldon>坦白说  借助我的名字和声望会对论文大有帮助
<5-13,Sheldon>Frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help,

194
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,850
<5-13,Sheldon>因为很多人都认为你已经是"过气的前浪"
<5-13,Sheldon>because a lot of people think that you're a washed-up has-been.

195
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,290
<5-13,Sheldon>或已经"死在沙滩上"了
<5-13,Sheldon>Or dead.

196
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,610
<5-14,Arthur>那我真是走了大运啊
<5-14,Arthur>I should be so lucky.

197
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,350
<5-15,Sheldon>那你觉得怎么样
<5-15,Sheldon>So, uh, what do you say?

198
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,780
<5-16,Arthur>如果你还是跟以前一样
<5-16,Arthur>You know, if it's all the same with you,

199
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,930
<5-16,Arthur>那我还是继续跟莱纳德合作吧
<5-16,Arthur>I think I'll stick with Leonard.

200
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,060
<5-17,Sheldon>因为我惹人厌  对吧
<5-17,Sheldon>It's because I'm annoying, right?

201
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,000
<5-17,Sheldon>我知道  说啊
<5-17,Sheldon>I know it is. Say it.

206
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,020

<5-19,Sheldon>I'm annoying. Say it.

207
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,980
<5-20,Arthur>你超级惹人厌
<5-20,Arthur>You're annoying!

208
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,150
<5-21,Sheldon>人家好伤心啊
<5-21,Sheldon>Wow, that really hurt.

209
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,340
<6-1,Leonard>如果在我小时候  有人跟我说
<6-1,Leonard>If you would have told me when I was a kid

210
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,880
<6-1,Leonard>我长大后会有机会
<6-1,Leonard>that someday I would be doing science

211
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,380
<6-1,Leonard>跟质子教授一起做实验
<6-1,Leonard>next to Professor Proton,

212
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,500
<6-1,Leonard>我一定不会相信
<6-1,Leonard>I would not have believed you.

213
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,540
<6-2,Arthur>如果有人跟我说
<6-2,Arthur>If someone had told me

214
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,040
<6-2,Arthur>人们在我83岁的时候
<6-2,Arthur>that people would still call me Professor Proton

215
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,320
<6-2,Arthur>还会称我为"质子教授"
<6-2,Arthur>when I was 83 years old,

216
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,180
<6-2,Arthur>我肯定不会戒烟
<6-2,Arthur>I never would have quit smoking.

217
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,370
<6-3,Leonard>抱歉  杰弗里斯博士  我只是太兴奋了
<6-3,Leonard>I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I'm just excited.

218
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,360
<6-3,Leonard>你对于纳米真空管的想法很有意思
<6-3,Leonard>This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is really interesting.

<6-4,Sheldon>What an odd coincidence that you're both here.

222
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,240
<6-5,Leonard>有什么巧合的
<6-5,Leonard>Why is it odd?

223
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,030
<6-6,Sheldon>因为碰巧的是  我今天也跟一位
<6-6,Sheldon>Because as it just so happens, I'm also spending the day

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,990
<7-2,Amy>佩妮  做得真漂亮
<7-2,Amy>Wow, Penny, good job.

246
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,990
<7-3,Penny>谢了  在商场买的  4块99
<7-3,Penny>Thanks. Target, $4.99.

247
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,360
<7-3,Penny>我再去倒一杯酒
<7-3,Penny>I'm getting a drink.

248
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,710
<7-4,Amy>你在做什么呢
<7-4,Amy>What are you working on?

249
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,540
<7-5,Raj>帮我妈做一串项链
<7-5,Raj>Oh, I'm making a necklace for my mom.

250
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,520
<7-6,Amy>真孝顺
<7-6,Amy>That's sweet.

251
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,810
<7-7,Raj>最近她和我爸的
<7-7,Raj>Yeah, she and my dad are going through

252
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,170
<7-7,Raj>关系有点紧张
<7-7,Raj>a bit of a rough patch, so

253
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,290
<7-7,Raj>所以我想表示一下让她知道
<7-7,Raj>I wanted to do something to let her know

254
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,580
<7-7,Raj>我挂念着她
<7-7,Raj>I was thinking about her.

255
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,980
<7-8,Penny>他们干嘛吵架呢
<7-8,Penny>What's going on with them?

256
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,240
<7-8,Penny>他们有点小小的沟通不良
<7-8,Penny>They're just having a little trouble communicating.

257
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,570
<7-9,Raj>我爸说我妈的声音
<7-9,Raj>My dad says it's because the sound of my mom's voice

258
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,910
<7-9,Raj>让他想把自己耳朵揪下来
<7-9,Raj>makes him want to tear his ears off

259
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,850
<7-9,Raj>再缝在他的眼睛上
<7-9,Raj>and sew them over his eyes

260
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,600
<7-9,Raj>这样他就永远不用再看见她了
<7-9,Raj>so he never has to look at her again.

261
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,670
<7-10,Bernadette>嗨
<7-10,Bernadette>Hi.

262
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,680
<7-11,Penny>-大家好啊  -嗨
<7-11,Penny>- Hey, guys. - Hello.

263
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,570
<7-13,Howard>看看是谁把
<7-13,Howard>Look who's here to put

265
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,270
<7-13,Howard>"犹太人"带进"珠宝之夜"了
<7-13,Howard>the "Jew" In "Jewelry Night"!

266
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,100
<7-14,Bernadette>种族笑话你自己说就没关系是吧
<7-14,Bernadette>Oh, sure, so it's fine when you say it.

267
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,710
<7-15,Howard>抱歉我们迟到了
<7-15,Howard>Sorry we're late.

268
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,700
<7-15,Howard>我顺便去了实验室
<7-15,Howard>I wanted to swing by the lab

269
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,820
<7-15,Howard>把更给力的工具给搬来了
<7-15,Howard>and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.

270
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,180
<7-16,Raj>我没想到你居然又出现了
<7-16,Raj>I didn't know you were coming again.

271
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,550
<7-17,Howard>上周还挺好玩的
<7-17,Howard>Well, last week was a blast.

272
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,580
<7-17,Howard>再说  我想你们也愿意有个男士陪伴吧
<7-17,Howard>Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.

273
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
<7-18,Penny (laughing)>其实一点也不好笑
<7-18,Penny (laughing)>It was not funny.

274
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,390
<7-19,Amy>那你带了什么工具来
<7-19,Amy>So, what tools did you bring?

275
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,170
<7-20,Howard>各种制作珠宝模子的工具
<7-20,Howard>Everything we need to make jewelry molds.

276
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,920
<7-20,Howard>银  坩埚
<7-20,Howard>Here's some silver, a crucible

277
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,080
<7-20,Howard>还有用来融化的乙炔炬
<7-20,Howard>and an acetylene torch to melt it down.

278
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,950
<7-21,Penny>这个看起来有意思
<7-21,Penny>Ooh, that looks like fun.

279
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,380
<7-22,Bernadette>还是等你先搞定胶水
<7-22,Bernadette>Maybe you should master glue

280
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,710
<7-22,Bernadette>再学习玩火吧
<7-22,Bernadette>before you move on to fire.

281
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,110
<7-23,Howard>好了  谁想先玩啊
<7-23,Howard>Okay, who's up first?

282
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,970
<7-24,Amy>拉杰什  你想再做一副和那项链
<7-24,Amy>Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom

283
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,410
<7-24,Amy>搭配的手镯送给你妈吗
<7-24,Amy>to go with the necklace?

284
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,510
<7-25,Raj>不用了
<7-25,Raj>No, thanks.

285
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,420
<7-26,Howard>我也想给我妈做一串项链
<7-26,Howard>I was gonna make a necklace for my mom,

286
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,070
<7-26,Howard>可惜  她胖得脖子都没有
<7-26,Howard>but unfortunately, she doesn't have a neck.

287
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,160
<7-26,Howard>她下巴之下是脂肪  脂肪之下就是脚
<7-26,Howard>She's just chins and fat and feet.

288
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,910
<8-1,Leonard>好  我们马上就可以开始了
<8-1,Leonard>Okay, we're almost ready to go.

289
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,390
<8-1,Leonard>把线连上  就可以开始测试这些管子了
<8-1,Leonard>Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.

290
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,120
<8-2,Arthur>太让人激动了  我觉得
<8-2,Arthur>This is so exciting, I-I feel...

291
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,930
<8-2,Arthur>就像重新回到75岁一样
<8-2,Arthur>like I'm 75 again.

292
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,510
<8-3,Leonard>老天爷
<8-3,Leonard>Oh, God.

293
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,650
<8-4,Arthur>出...什么事了
<8-4,Arthur>What... what is it?

294
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,800
<8-5,Leonard>谢尔顿发了一张
<8-5,Leonard>Sheldon just sent me a picture

295
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,370
<8-5,Leonard>他和比尔·奈一起喝冰沙的照片
<8-5,Leonard>of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.

296
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,130
<8-6,Arthur>我  我能问个问题吗
<8-6,Arthur>Can-can I ask you a question?

297
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,560
<8-7,Leonard>当然  问吧
<8-7,Leonard>Yeah, sure.

298
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,350
<8-8,Arthur>你怎么能忍受谢尔顿这种人啊
<8-8,Arthur>W-Why do you put up with Sheldon?

299
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,060
<8-9,Leonard>因为我们是朋友呀
<8-9,Leonard>Oh, uh, you know, because we're friends.

300
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,290
<8-10,Arthur>为什么呀
<8-10,Arthur>Why?

301
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,040
<8-11,Leonard>-你真喜欢给人出难题  -当然
<8-11,Leonard>- Wow, you ask really hard questions. - Yeah.

302
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,930
<8-13,Leonard>我知道他总是惹人厌
<8-13,Leonard>Look, I-I know he can be aggravating,

303
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,290
<8-13,Leonard>但你要知道
<8-13,Leonard>but what you have to remember is that

304
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,730
<8-13,Leonard>他不是故意的
<8-13,Leonard>he's not doing it on purpose.

305
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,460
<8-13,Leonard>只是他这人天性如此
<8-13,Leonard>It's just how he is.

306
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,580
<8-13,Leonard>其实他很忠诚也很可靠
<8-13,Leonard>But he's also loyal and trustworthy

307
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,070
<8-13,Leonard>我们在一起挺开心的
<8-13,Leonard>and we have fun together...

308
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,280
<8-14,Arthur>你...你知道自己是在描述一只狗吧
<8-14,Arthur>You... you know you're describing a dog.

309
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,940
<8-15,Leonard>他的确咬过我一次
<8-15,Leonard>He did bite me once.

310
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,530
<8-15,Leonard>但他解释说
<8-15,Leonard>But in his defense,

311
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,570
<8-15,Leonard>我在他进食时突然从背后冒出来  所以
<8-15,Leonard>I came up behind him while he was eating, so...

312
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,730
<8-16,Arthur>狗都不喜欢那样
<8-16,Arthur>Yeah, they-they hate that.

313
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,290
<8-17,Leonard>谢尔顿是我遇见过的最聪明的家伙
<8-17,Leonard>You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met.

314
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,910
<8-17,Leonard>他并不是完人  所以才需要我
<8-17,Leonard>And he's a little broken and he needs me.

315
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,930
<8-17,Leonard>我大概也需要他吧
<8-17,Leonard>I guess I need him, too.

316
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,970
<8-18,Arthur>为  为什么呢
<8-18,Arthur>Why-why is that?

317
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,380
<8-19,Leonard>你非得打破沙锅问到底  是吧
<8-19,Leonard>Boy, you will not let this go, will you?

318
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,450
<8-19,Leonard>我的天
<8-19,Leonard>Oh, geez.

319
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,790
<8-20,Arthur>又是谢尔顿发来的照片吗
<8-20,Arthur>Another photo from Sheldon?

320
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,380
<8-21,Leonard>不是  我得去接他一下
<8-21,Leonard>No, I have to go pick him up.

321
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,850
<8-21,Leonard>比尔·奈把他抛弃在冰沙店了
<8-21,Leonard>Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.

322
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,150
<8-22,Arthur>大概把他的钱包也顺手偷走了
<8-22,Arthur>He probably stole his wallet, too.

323
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,010
<9-1,Howard>如果你们感兴趣的话
<9-1,Howard>You know, if you guys are interested,

324
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,360
<9-1,Howard>有种技术可以让我把你们的一束头发
<9-1,Howard>there's a technique where I can take a lock of your hair,

325
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,280
<9-1,Howard>提炼成碳粉
<9-1,Howard>refine it into carbon dust,

326
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,690
<9-1,Howard>然后用实验室的液压器
<9-1,Howard>and use the hydraulic press at work

327
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,620
<9-1,Howard>把它转变成一颗小小的钻石
<9-1,Howard>to turn it into a tiny little diamond

328
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,100
<9-1,Howard>里面还有你自己的DNA哦
<9-1,Howard>with your DNA in it.

329
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,870
<9-2,Penny>太神奇了吧
<9-2,Penny>Oh, that's amazing!

330
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,150
<9-3,Howard>看到妮妮订婚戒指了吗
<9-3,Howard>Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?

331
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,540
<9-3,Howard>原料是我妈背部的体毛
<9-3,Howard>That came right off my mom's back.

332
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,520
<9-4,Bernadette>他开玩笑的
<9-4,Bernadette>He's kidding.

333
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,170
<9-4,Bernadette>真是这样  钻石会大得多
<9-4,Bernadette>If that were true, it'd be so much bigger.

334
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,020
<9-5,Raj>我叫霍华德
<9-5,Raj>"My name is Howard.

335
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,410
<9-5,Raj>我可以把你的毛发变成钻石
<9-5,Raj>I can make your hair into diamonds.

336
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,690
<9-5,Raj>我妈有病态肥胖症
<9-5,Raj>My mom is morbidly obese.

337
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,660
<9-5,Raj>人人都爱我
<9-5,Raj>Everybody love me."

338
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,050
<9-6,Howard>为啥一股很不爽我的口气
<9-6,Howard>Whoa, where is that coming from?

339
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,860
<9-7,Raj>我告诉你为什么
<9-7,Raj>I'll tell you where it's coming from.

340
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,870
<9-7,Raj>你之前嘲笑我参加闺蜜之夜
<9-7,Raj>All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls' night

341
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,010
<9-7,Raj>现在你又跑来这里毁了大家的好时光
<9-7,Raj>and now you're here ruining it for everyone.

342
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,040
<9-8,Penny>拉杰  淡定
<9-8,Penny>Raj, cool it...

343
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,370
<9-8,Penny>他要给咱们做钻石呢
<9-8,Penny>he's gonna make us hair diamonds.

344
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
<9-9,Howard>我怎么毁了你们的好时光
<9-9,Howard>How am I ruining anything?

345
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,070
<9-9,Howard>我只是想帮你把珠宝做得更好
<9-9,Howard>I'm just trying to help you make better jewelry.

346
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,710
<9-10,Raj>但是重点不在珠宝
<9-10,Raj>But this isn't about the jewelry.

347
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,350
<9-10,Raj>而在于在这里
<9-10,Raj>This is about me having a place

348
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,650
<9-10,Raj>我可以敞开心扉  无所不谈
<9-10,Raj>where I can open up about my feelings.

349
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,770
<9-11,Howard>你什么时候开始不能对我敞开心扉谈了
<9-11,Howard>Since when can't you open up with me?

350
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,250
<9-12,Raj>有些话题
<9-12,Raj>There are just some things

351
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,110
<9-12,Raj>我觉得和姑娘们说更自在
<9-12,Raj>that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls,

352
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,730
<9-12,Raj>因为她们不会嘲笑我
<9-12,Raj>because they won't make fun of me

353
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,130
<9-12,Raj>不会给我取绰号  或是问我
<9-12,Raj>or and call me names, or ask me if my

354
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,080
<9-12,Raj>库萨帕里你的内裤是不是卷在了一起
<9-12,Raj>"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

356
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,510
<9-13,Howard>兄弟  我那是开玩笑的
<9-13,Howard>Buddy, I was just joking around.

357
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,830
<9-14,Raj>有时候你的玩笑很伤人
<9-14,Raj>Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.

358
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,680
<9-14,Raj>你说得对
<9-14,Raj>Well, you're right.

359
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,210
<9-15,Howard>我没意识到会让你有这种感受
<9-15,Howard>I didn't realize I was making you feel that way.

360
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,400
<9-15,Howard>你能坦白告诉我真是太勇敢了
<9-15,Howard>It was very brave of you to tell me.

361
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,280
<9-15,Howard>谢谢
<9-15,Howard>Thank you.

362
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,070
<9-16,Raj>对我来说不容易
<9-16,Raj>It wasn't easy.

363
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,500
<9-17,Amy>他们会抢在我和谢尔顿之前先上床
<9-17,Amy>They're gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do,

364
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,580
<9-17,Amy>我就知道
<9-17,Amy>I know it.
