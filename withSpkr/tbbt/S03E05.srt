1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,060
<1-1,Howard>好的  拉杰出了幽灵军团卡
<1-1,Howard>All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card,

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,900
<1-1,Howard>我就出绞杀蔓藤帮他
<1-1,Howard>And I am going to back him up with my strangling vines.

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,440
<1-1,Howard>绞死你  笨蛋
<1-1,Howard>Choke on that, sucka.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,340
<1-2,Leonard>那我就用红宝石剑砍断你的蔓藤
<1-2,Leonard>Okay, well, then I'll just cut your vines with my ruby sword.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,280
<1-2,Leonard>没错  我干的  我砍了
<1-2,Leonard>That's right, I did it. I cut 'em.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,100
<1-3,Penny>我想问个问题
<1-3,Penny>I have a question.

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,850
<1-4,Leonard>军团能吃巨人  巨人能吃精灵
<1-4,Leonard>Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,190
<1-4,Leonard>精灵能吃水妖
<1-4,Leonard>Elf beats water sprite,

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,730
<1-4,Leonard>基本上什么都能吃魔法小兔
<1-4,Leonard>And basically everything beats enchanted bunny.

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,760
<1-5,Howard>除非你有胡萝卜粉
<1-5,Howard>Unless you have the carrot powder.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,900
<1-6,Penny>我还想问一个问题
<1-6,Penny>Okay, I've got another question.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,920
<1-6,Penny>这有什么好玩的
<1-6,Penny>When does this get fun?

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,870
<1-7,Howard>我们是要讨论
<1-7,Howard>Are we going to talk

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,820
<1-7,Howard>还是继续玩"卡亚神秘勇士"
<1-7,Howard>Or are we going to play "mystic warriors of ka-ah"?

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,120
<1-8,Leonard>出毒药卡
<1-8,Leonard>Just play a potion card.

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,590
<1-9,Penny>哪张
<1-9,Penny>Which one?

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,630
<1-10,Sheldon>哪张都一样
<1-10,Sheldon>It doesn't matter.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,810
<1-10,Sheldon>你不可能赢了
<1-10,Sheldon>You can't possibly win.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,960
<1-11,Leonard>谢尔顿  别破坏游戏
<1-11,Leonard>Sheldon, don't ruin the game.

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,410
<1-12,Penny>他怎么可能破坏游戏
<1-12,Penny>How could he ruin the game?

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,170
<1-13,Sheldon>根据已出的卡推算
<1-13,Sheldon>Given the cards that have already been played,

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,760
<1-13,Sheldon>佩妮手上只能有巫师毒药
<1-13,Sheldon>Penny can only be holding necromancer potions,

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,090
<1-13,Sheldon>毒药只对幽灵和日行者有效
<1-13,Sheldon>Which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers,

24
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,820
<1-13,Sheldon>但两个都已经出完了
<1-13,Sheldon>And there are no more of either left to be drawn.

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,260
<1-13,Sheldon>剩下未出的卡是
<1-13,Sheldon>The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are:

26
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,610
<1-13,Sheldon>四张火焰  一张巨人  两张食人怪和冥神宝石
<1-13,Sheldon>Four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of osiris.

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,930
<1-14,Leonard>瞧  被破坏了吧
<1-14,Leonard>See? Ruined.

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,770
<1-15,Penny>谢尔顿  太厉害了
<1-15,Penny>Sheldon, that is incredible.

29
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,950
<1-16,Sheldon>对你来说  当然是厉害
<1-16,Sheldon>From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.

30
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,160
<1-17,Leonard>谢尔顿有图像式记忆的能力
<1-17,Leonard>Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,280
<1-18,Sheldon>"图像式"用词不当
<1-18,Sheldon>"photographic" is a misnomer.

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,160
<1-18,Sheldon>应该是高清图像式记忆  我说过好几遍了
<1-18,Sheldon>I have an eidetic memory, as I've told you many times.

33
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,360
<1-18,Sheldon>最近一次是去年5月7日
<1-18,Sheldon>Most recently last year during lunch

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,150
<1-18,Sheldon>中午午餐期间
<1-18,Sheldon>On the afternoon of may seventh.

35
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,790
<1-18,Sheldon>你吃了火鸡  还抱怨太干了
<1-18,Sheldon>You had turkey and complained it was dry.

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,620
<1-19,Howard>看来游戏结束了
<1-19,Howard>Well, I guess game'over.

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,590
<1-20,Penny>真的  太好了
<1-20,Penny>Really? Oh, great.

38
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,090
<1-20,Penny>我是说"哦"
<1-20,Penny>I mean, aw.

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,010
<1-20,Penny>-我得走了  -为什么
<1-20,Penny>- Okay, I gotta go. - Why?

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,550
<1-22,Penny>就因为上次没走
<1-22,Penny>Because the last me I didn't go,

41
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,380
<1-22,Penny>我才会玩"卡神秘勇士"
<1-22,Penny>I ended up playing "mystic warlords of ka."

42
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,150
<1-23,Howard>不是"卡"  是"卡亚"
<1-23,Howard>Not "ka. Ka-ah."

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,360
<1-24,Penny>拜丫儿
<1-24,Penny>Buh-eye.

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
<1-25,Leonard>回见
<1-25,Leonard>See ya.

45
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,190
<1-25,Leonard>还是不敢相信她和我在一起了
<1-25,Leonard>Still can't believe she's going out with me.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,950
<1-26,Raj>没人相信
<1-26,Raj>Nobody can.

47
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,820
<1-27,Howard>这倒提醒我有笔旧账还没跟你算清
<1-27,Howard>That reminds me I have a bone to pick with you.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,570
<1-28,Leonard>什么
<1-28,Leonard>What?

49
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,520
<1-28,Leonard>你我有个约定
<1-28,Leonard>You and I made a pact

50
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,990
<1-29,Howard>我们中谁先追到个漂亮女友
<1-29,Howard>That if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend,

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,490
<1-29,Howard>谁就得让他的女友
<1-29,Howard>That person would have his girlfriend

52
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,710
<1-29,Howard>给对方介绍一个女友
<1-29,Howard>Hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.

53
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,750
<1-30,Leonard>我不记得有这回事
<1-30,Leonard>I don't remember that.

54
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,150
<1-31,Sheldon>2004年  6月30日
<1-31,Sheldon>June 30th, 2004.

55
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,700
<1-31,Sheldon>《蜘蛛侠 2》在帕萨迪纳AMC影院上映
<1-31,Sheldon>Opening day of Spider-Man 2 at the Amc Pasadena.

56
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,410
<1-31,Sheldon>那里只有红冰极饮料  没有蓝的
<1-31,Sheldon>They only had red icees, no blue.

57
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,840
<1-32,Leonard>想起来了
<1-32,Leonard>Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,480
<1-33,Howard>你和佩妮在一起都有一个半月了
<1-33,Howard>So you've been with Penny for like a month and a half now.

59
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,990
<1-33,Howard>我的妞呢
<1-33,Howard>Where's my shorty, morty?

60
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,510
<1-34,Leonard>霍华德  你不能要求我这么做
<1-34,Leonard>Howard, you can't hold me to that.

61
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,730
<1-35,Howard>为什么不行
<1-35,Howard>Why not?

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,100
<1-36,Leonard>因为当时约定时
<1-36,Leonard>Because when I made that agreement,

63
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,900
<1-36,Leonard>我没想过能交到一个漂亮女友
<1-36,Leonard>I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend.

64
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,320
<1-36,Leonard>我当时以为你能交到呢
<1-36,Leonard>And I was positive you ever would.

65
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,240
<1-37,Raj>我怎么不知道这件事
<1-37,Raj>Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?

66
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,020
<1-38,Sheldon>你当时不在小食店
<1-38,Sheldon>You had left the refreshment stand

67
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,530
<1-38,Sheldon>你去解决习惯性提前出现的尿急了
<1-38,Sheldon>In order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.

68
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,410
<1-40,Howard>就因为这个
<1-40,Howard>Oh, so that's how it works?

69
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,900
<1-39,Raj>就因为我的膀胱小  我就不能有漂亮女友了
<1-39,Raj>I have a teeny bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?

70
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,040
<1-40,Howard>对  拉杰  就因为这个
<1-40,Howard>Yeah, Raj. That's how it works.

71
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,590
<1-41,Raj>靠
<1-41,Raj>Damn.

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
<1-41,Raj>生活大爆炸
<1-41,Raj>第三季第五集

73
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,000
<2-1,Leonard>能给我张纸巾吗
<2-1,Leonard>Can I have a napkin?

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,720
<2-2,Sheldon>抱歉  不行
<2-2,Sheldon>I'm sorry, no.

75
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,220
<2-3,Leonard>你有好几张呢
<2-3,Leonard>But you have whole bunch of 'em.

76
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,760
<2-4,Sheldon>对  我现在用的是四张纸巾体系
<2-4,Sheldon>Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system.

77
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,430
<2-4,Sheldon>分别对应腿  手  脸和个人紧急情况
<2-4,Sheldon>Lap, hands, face and personal emergency.

78
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,630
<2-4,Sheldon>你需要的话  明天开始
<2-4,Sheldon>If you like, starting tomorrow,

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,270
<2-4,Sheldon>我会加一张客用纸巾
<2-4,Sheldon>I'll add a guest napkin,

80
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,260
<2-4,Sheldon>但我今天实在无能为力
<2-4,Sheldon>But I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today.

81
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,930
<2-4,Sheldon>好运  那是擦脸纸巾
<2-4,Sheldon>Good luck. That's the face napkin.

82
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,880
<2-5,Howard>你跟佩妮说了吗
<2-5,Howard>So, have you talked to Penny yet?

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,030
<2-6,Leonard>还没有
<2-6,Leonard>No, I haven't.

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,170
<2-7,Howard>为什么
<2-7,Howard>Why not?

85
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,550
<2-8,Leonard>因为我很忙
<2-8,Leonard>Because I've been busy,

86
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,370
<2-8,Leonard>因为我不知道怎么跟她提
<2-8,Leonard>Because I haven't figured out a way to bring it up,

87
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,350
<2-8,Leonard>最主要的是  "特别强调这点"
<2-8,Leonard>And mostly-- and I can't stress how key this is--

88
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,190
<2-8,Leonard>因为我不想提
<2-8,Leonard>Because I don't want to.

89
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,510
<2-9,Howard>莱纳德  约定就是约定
<2-9,Howard>Leonard, pact is a pact.

90
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,550
<2-9,Howard>你必须让佩妮给我找个伴
<2-9,Howard>You have to get Penny to fix me up.

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,550
<2-10,Leonard>事情没那么简单
<2-10,Leonard>It's not that simple.

92
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,720
<2-10,Leonard>你要我怎么说
<2-10,Leonard>What am I supposed to say?

93
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,930
<2-10,Leonard>佩妮  你有没有
<2-10,Leonard>"Penny, do you have any friend

94
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,380
<2-10,Leonard>不想再联系的朋友
<2-10,Leonard>You'd like to never hear from again?"

95
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,600
<2-10,Leonard>拜托  我那么聪明
<2-10,Leonard>Come on, I'm smart,

96
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,090
<2-11,Howard>又有份好工作  而且我的体脂肪率只有3%
<2-11,Howard>I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.

97
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,310
<2-12,Raj>真的
<2-12,Raj>It's true.

98
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,890
<2-12,Raj>我在沙滩上看过
<2-12,Raj>I've seen him at the beach.

99
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,110
<2-12,Raj>他就像个人形鸡翅
<2-12,Raj>He's like a human chicken wing.

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,730
<2-13,Howard>莱纳德  拜托
<2-13,Howard>Leonard, come on.

101
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,900
<2-14,Leonard>好吧  我会问她有没有适合你的朋友
<2-14,Leonard>Fine. I'll ask if she has a friend for you.

102
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,070
<2-15,Howard>要漂亮的哦
<2-15,Howard>Hot friend.

103
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
<2-16,Leonard>-行 -还要高挑的
<2-16,Leonard>- Right. - And tall.

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,790
<2-17,Howard>我希望我们的孩子能在20岁前
<2-17,Howard>I want our kids to be able to Ride Space Mountain

105
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,760
<2-17,Howard>玩飞越太空山[迪士尼乐园]
<2-17,Howard>Before they're 20.

106
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,140
<2-18,Leonard>我尽力而为
<2-18,Leonard>I'll see what I can do.

107
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,260
<2-19,Raj>谢尔顿  猜我今天听到什么
<2-19,Raj>Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?

108
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,380
<2-20,Sheldon>我能想象你今天听了很多东西
<2-20,Sheldon>I'd imagine you heard many number of things today.

109
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,550
<2-20,Sheldon>你来上班肯定会听到  "你好  拉杰"
<2-20,Sheldon>When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, "hello, Raj.

110
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,770
<2-20,Sheldon>过得如何  拉杰
<2-20,Sheldon>"How are you, Raj?"

111
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
<2-20,Sheldon>考虑到你今天穿了件新的羊毛背心  会听到"新背心啊"
<2-20,Sheldon>Given that you're wearing a new sweater-vest,

112
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,920
<2-20,Sheldon>也有可能  虽然可能性很小  听到"羊毛背心很漂亮"
<2-20,Sheldon>And possibly, though far less likely, "nice sweater-vest."

113
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,440
<2-21,Raj>为什么不干脆让我告诉你今天听到了什么
<2-21,Raj>Why don't I just tell you what I heard today.

114
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,260
<2-22,Sheldon>因为这可能节约我们的时间
<2-22,Sheldon>That would probably save us some time.

115
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,600
<2-23,Raj>星期六晚上在漫画书店
<2-23,Raj>Saturday night at the comic book store,

116
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,280
<2-23,Raj>那里将举办一个"卡亚神秘勇士"锦标赛
<2-23,Raj>They're having a "Mystic Warlords of Ka-Ah" tournament.

117
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,770
<2-23,Raj>第一名有500美金
<2-23,Raj>First prize is $500.

118
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,660
<2-23,Raj>如果我们组队  肯定无敌了
<2-23,Raj>If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.

119
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,570
<2-24,Sheldon>对不起  拉杰  对于没有挑战性的游戏
<2-24,Sheldon>I'm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest

120
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,940
<2-24,Sheldon>我完全不感兴趣
<2-24,Sheldon>In playing a game in which I find no challenge.

121
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,480
<2-25,Raj>那钱呢
<2-25,Raj>What about the money?

122
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,590
<2-26,Sheldon>我有钱啊
<2-26,Sheldon>I have money.

123
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,320
<2-27,Raj>这钱不一样
<2-27,Raj>This is other money.

124
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,770
<2-28,Sheldon>那这跟我自己拥有的钱有什么区别
<2-28,Sheldon>How does it differ from the money I have?

125
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,010
<2-29,Raj>我要拿一半啊
<2-29,Raj>Half of it will be mine.

126
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,430
<2-30,Sheldon>你需要钱买一件不那么惹人嫌的羊毛背心吗
<2-30,Sheldon>Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?

127
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,830
<2-31,Raj>莱纳德  救救我吧
<2-31,Raj>Leonard, help.

128
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,750
<2-32,Leonard>开什么玩笑
<2-32,Leonard>Are you kidding?

129
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,040
<2-32,Leonard>我甚至不能说服他给我一张狗日的餐巾纸
<2-32,Leonard>I couldn't even talk him into giving one of his freakin' napkins.

130
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,810
<3-1,Penny>天呐  你真是个天才
<3-1,Penny>Wow, you really are a genius.

131
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,430
<3-1,Penny>不算吧
<3-1,Penny>Not really.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,520
<3-2,Leonard>我其实是在网上搜到的这些花式
<3-2,Leonard>I googled how to do that.

133
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,170
<3-2,Leonard>问一下  你有跟谁有过约定吗
<3-2,Leonard>So, listen...Have you ever made a pact with someone?

134
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,010
<3-3,Penny>你是说那种拉勾勾誓言吗
<3-3,Penny>You mean like a pinky swear?

135
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,160
<3-4,Leonard>好吧  就算是那种拉勾勾誓言
<3-4,Leonard>Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.

136
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,780
<3-5,Penny>一年级时候  我和我朋友萝茜
<3-5,Penny>Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I

137
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,620
<3-5,Penny>约定要嫁给毕特和恩尼
<3-5,Penny>Made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.

138
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,290
<3-5,Penny>你知道的  芝麻街里面[美国木偶剧]
<3-5,Penny>You know, from Sesame street?

139
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,990
<3-6,Leonard>我跟毕特和恩尼还蛮熟的
<3-6,Leonard>I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.

140
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,990
<3-7,Penny>然后我们发现都想要嫁给恩尼
<3-7,Penny>Then we find out we both wanted Ernie.

141
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,730
<3-7,Penny>我们直到中学都没再说过话
<3-7,Penny>We didn't speak again until middle school.

142
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,510
<3-8,Leonard>就因为那个木偶
<3-8,Leonard>Over puppets?

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,870
<3-9,Penny>各人心头所好啊  莱纳德
<3-9,Penny>The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.

144
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,120
<3-9,Penny>好吧
<3-9,Penny>Okay.

145
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,140
<3-10,Leonard>说到心头所好
<3-10,Leonard>Speaking of what the heart want-

146
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,760
<3-10,Leonard>很久以前
<3-10,Leonard>Um, a long time ago,

147
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,410
<3-10,Leonard>我跟沃罗威茨有个约定  其中牵涉到你
<3-10,Leonard>I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.

148
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,660
<3-11,Penny>我不知道接下来你要说什么
<3-11,Penny>Okay, I don't know where you're going with this,

149
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,690
<3-11,Penny>但你最好小心点  因为我们可能因此玩完
<3-11,Penny>But tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.

150
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,050
<3-12,Leonard>不  不  不是那样的
<3-12,Leonard>No, no, nothing like that.

151
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,920
<3-12,Leonard>交易说的是如果我们当中任意一个有女朋友了
<3-12,Leonard>The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend,

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,200
<3-12,Leonard>我们就要她介绍她的朋友
<3-12,Leonard>We'd have her fix the other one up

153
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,020
<3-12,Leonard>给约定的另一方
<3-12,Leonard>With one of her friends.

154
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,520
<3-13,Penny>你觉得这种事适合在激情过后马上说吗
<3-13,Penny>And you thought it's a good time to bring this up right after sex?

155
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,330
<3-14,Leonard>我只是很确定在激情之前不会说
<3-14,Leonard>Well, I sure as hell wasn't going to bring it up before sex.

156
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,480
<3-14,Leonard>而在激情进行时  我在尽力回想在谷歌上看到的花式  所以
<3-14,Leonard>And during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so...

157
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,240
<3-15,Penny>我绝不会介绍我的朋友给沃罗威茨
<3-15,Penny>I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.

158
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,280
<3-16,Leonard>不一定是要好朋友啊
<3-16,Leonard>It doesn't have to be a good friend.

159
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,510
<3-16,Leonard>而且你也知道他内里其实是个很好的人
<3-16,Leonard>And you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy.

160
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,280
<3-17,Penny>这问题不在于他的内里
<3-17,Penny>The problem isn't what's on the inside.

161
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,540
<3-17,Penny>在于他令人毛骨悚然的淫荡外表
<3-17,Penny>It's the creepy candy coating.

162
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,210
<3-18,Leonard>你能好歹考虑一下吗
<3-18,Leonard>Will you at least think about it?

163
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,440
<3-18,Leonard>就当是帮我个忙
<3-18,Leonard>Just as a favor to me?

164
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,260
<3-19,Penny>我最喜欢恩尼的一点
<3-19,Penny>Oh, great thing about ernie,

165
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,050
<3-19,Penny>就是他从不求我什么
<3-19,Penny>Was he never asked me for anything.

166
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,500
<3-19,Penny>他只给予
<3-19,Penny>He just gave.

<6-7,Raj>如果惠顿和斯图尔特赢了这一局
<6-7,Raj>Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match

261
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,040

<6-9,Raj>真的很找抽
<6-9,Raj>It's really lame.

270
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,660
<6-10,Sheldon>肃静
<6-10,Sheldon>Silence!

271

277
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,190
<7-5,Howard>微生物学不就是研究微小的生物吗
