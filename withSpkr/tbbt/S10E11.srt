25
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,790
<1-1,Howard>天啊
<1-1,Howard>Oh, man.

26
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,540
<1-1,Howard>终于到了这一刻
<1-1,Howard>This is really happening.

27
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,910
<1-1,Howard>你还好吗
<1-1,Howard>You doin' okay?

28
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,760
<1-2,Bernadette>又来一波阵痛了
<1-2,Bernadette>Here comes another contraction.

29
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,940
<1-3,Stuart>加速啊
<1-3,Stuart>Let's pick it up!

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,470
<1-4,Raj>好  坐稳了
<1-4,Raj>All right, hold on.

31
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,170
<1-4,Raj>我要用我们印度当地的方式开车了
<1-4,Raj>I'm gonna drive like we do in India.

32
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,910
<1-4,Raj>死一边去  你个梅毒贱狗
<1-4,Raj>Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs!

33
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,250
<1-5,Howard>别这样  这里不是印度
<1-5,Howard>Stop that! This isn't India.

34
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,450
<1-6,Raj>好吧
<1-6,Raj>Fine.

35
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,010
<1-6,Raj>堂堂13亿人口大国的人哪懂生孩子的事啊
<1-6,Raj>What do one point three billion people know about having babies?

37
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,730
<1-7,Howard>对不起啦  我知道你也是想帮忙
<1-7,Howard>Sorry. I know you were just trying to help.

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,110
<1-8,Raj>我爱你
<1-8,Raj>I love you.

40
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,680
<1-8,Raj>我也爱你啦  没事的
<1-8,Raj>I love you, too. We're good.

48
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,510
<2-1,Sheldon>艾米
<2-1,Sheldon>Amy?

49
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,310
<2-1,Sheldon>醒醒
<2-1,Sheldon>Wake up.

50
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,310
<2-2,Amy>怎么了
<2-2,Amy>Wh... What's wrong?

51
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,750
<2-3,Sheldon>现在是午夜
<2-3,Sheldon>It's midnight.

52
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,790
<2-3,Sheldon>生日快乐
<2-3,Sheldon>Happy birthday.

53
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,270
<2-3,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<2-3,Sheldon>Sheldon.

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,620
<2-4,Amy>这个东西先没收  早上起床后还你
<2-4,Amy>Okay, you can have this back in the morning.

55
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,920
<2-5,Sheldon>这是给你的
<2-5,Sheldon>This is for you.

56
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,520
<2-5,Sheldon>我本来打算把它包好
<2-5,Sheldon>I was going to wrap it,

57
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,250
<2-5,Sheldon>但是想到要碰透明胶布我就浑身发毛
<2-5,Sheldon>but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.

58
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,630
<2-6,Amy>我会记得你不喜欢胶布  桃子与毡制品
<2-6,Amy>I'll put in on the list with peaches and felt.

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,650
<2-6,Amy>这是什么
<2-6,Amy>What is this?

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,060
<2-7,Sheldon>我大脑的功能性磁共振成像
<2-7,Sheldon>A functional MRI of my brain.

61
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,230
<2-7,Sheldon>我在拍之前做了一把数独来显得更脑力惊人
<2-7,Sheldon>I did Sudoku before they took it so I'd be ripped.

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,170
<2-8,Amy>我喜欢  谢谢你
<2-8,Amy>I love it. Thank you.

63
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,520
<2-9,Sheldon>而且玄机不止如此
<2-9,Sheldon>And it's not just an MRI.

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,350
<2-9,Sheldon>我的大脑眼窝前额皮质是亮起的
<2-9,Sheldon>The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up

65
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,870
<2-9,Sheldon>因为我当时想着你
<2-9,Sheldon>because I was thinking of you.

66
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,060
<2-10,Amy>谢尔顿
<2-10,Amy>Sheldon!

67
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,810
<2-11,Sheldon>我们貌似又来到了你生日庆典中的
<2-11,Sheldon>We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion

68
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,290
<2-11,Sheldon>年度交媾仪式了
<2-11,Sheldon>of your birthday festivities.

69
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,660
<2-12,Amy>可以吗
<2-12,Amy>Is that okay?

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,270
<2-13,Sheldon>不然我穿诱人格子睡衣是为啥呢
<2-13,Sheldon>I didn't put on my come-hither plaid PJ's for nothing.

71
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,840
<2-14,Amy>你讨厌透明[苏格兰]胶带  却喜欢苏格兰格纹
<2-14,Amy>You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid.

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,260
<2-14,Amy>迷一般的男人啊
<2-14,Amy>You are a mystery.

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,510
<2-15,Penny (off)>你们快起床
<2-15,Penny (off)>Guys, wake up!

74
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,070
<2-15,Penny (off)>伯纳黛特要生啦
<2-15,Penny (off)>Bernadette's having her baby!

75
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,680
<2-16,Leonard (off)>起床  我们要去医院了
<2-16,Leonard (off)>Come on, we're going to the hospital!

76
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,940
<2-17,Amy>我想...  我想我们得先停下
<2-17,Amy>I guess... I guess we should stop.

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,710
<2-18,Sheldon>恐怕是的
<2-18,Sheldon>Yeah. I'm afraid so.

78
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,680
<2-18,Sheldon>生孩子  差点交媾
<2-18,Sheldon>Childbirth, looming coitus?

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,920
<2-18,Sheldon>这可真是个女性生殖器官的精彩之夜
<2-18,Sheldon>This is a banner night for female genitals.

80
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,070
<3-1,Midwife>旁边有三个男的
<3-1,Midwife>Now I see three of you.

81
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,270
<3-1,Midwife>知道谁是生父吗  还是像《妈妈咪呀》那样
<3-1,Midwife>Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?

82
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:39,300
<3-1,Midwife>这部音乐剧中  女主角结婚想请父亲来
<3-1,Midwife>但是妈妈的三个旧情人中  并不知道谁才是生父

83
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,300
<3-2,Howard>我是孩子的爹
<3-2,Howard>I'm the father.

84
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,340
<3-3,Midwife>孩子的爹  阵痛间隔是多久
<3-3,Midwife>Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?

85
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,090
<3-4,Howard>不知道  问他
<3-4,Howard>No idea. Ask him.

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,560
<3-5,Raj>12分钟
<3-5,Raj>12 minutes.

87
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,030
<3-6,Midwife>12分钟吗  那你们来干嘛
<3-6,Midwife>12 minutes? Why are you here?

88
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,440
<3-7,Stuart>不是应该提早一个半小时到场吗
<3-7,Stuart>Aren't we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?

89
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,320
<3-8,Midwife>这里是医院  不是机场
<3-8,Midwife>This is a hospital, not the airport.

90
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,600
<3-9,Bernadette>对不起了  我们第一次生孩子
<3-9,Bernadette>I'm sorry. It's our first time.

91
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
<3-9,Bernadette>没事的
<3-9,Bernadette>It's okay.

92
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,130
<3-10,Midwife>小家伙很快就会出生了
<3-10,Midwife>This little one will be here before you know it.

93
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,830
<3-10,Midwife>知道会是男孩还是女孩吗
<3-10,Midwife>Do we know what we're having?

94
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,560
<3-11,Howard>不知道  我们想留个惊喜
<3-11,Howard>No, we're keeping it a surprise.

95
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,670
<3-12,Midwife>传统作风  我喜欢
<3-12,Midwife>Old school. Nice.

96
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,660
<3-13,Bernadette>也没那么传统  他知道
<3-13,Bernadette>Not that old school. He knows.

97
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,780
<3-14,Raj>是这样嘛  我当时在医生办公室嘛
<3-14,Raj>You see, I was at the doctor's office,

98
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,310
<3-14,Raj>然后孩子档案就放在那边嘛  我就偷看一眼嘛
<3-14,Raj>the folder was right there, so I took a peek.

99
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,640
<3-15,Howard>就算你这么说  那件事也还是很变态嘛
<3-15,Howard>And talking like this doesn't make it less creepy.

100
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,580
<3-16,Midwife>亲爱的  你先回家
<3-16,Midwife>Sweetheart, go home.

101
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,760
<3-16,Midwife>等阵痛间隔5分钟持续一小时后再来
<3-16,Midwife>Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.

102
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,180
<3-16,Midwife>抱歉  这说得有点不清楚
<3-16,Midwife>I'm sorry. That's ambiguous.

103
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,130
<3-17,Raj>这间隔五分钟是包含第一次的这一个小时
<3-17,Raj>Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour,

104
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,510
<3-17,Raj>还是第一次5分钟间隔阵痛后一小时
<3-17,Raj>or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction,

105
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,960
<3-17,Raj>所以基本上就是维持65分钟后
<3-17,Raj>so essentially, like, 65 minutes?

106
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,580
<3-18,Midwife>我就随口这么一说
<3-18,Midwife>I'm just throwing this out there,

107
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,160
<3-18,Midwife>但这年头家中分娩也挺流行的
<3-18,Midwife>but home births are very popular these days.

108
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,540
<4-1,Penny>谢尔顿  为什么你拖这么久
<4-1,Penny>Sheldon, what took you so long?

109
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,380
<4-2,Sheldon>生孩子父亲都会发雪茄庆祝
<4-2,Sheldon>Wolowitz might hand out cigars.

110
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,930
<4-2,Sheldon>所以我得找出我的泡泡糖雪茄
<4-2,Sheldon>I had to find my bubble gum cigar

111
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,880
<4-2,Sheldon>到时才能不像个傻逼地加入大家
<4-2,Sheldon>so I could join in without looking foolish.

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
<4-3,Leonard>靠  我得去拿我气喘药
<4-3,Leonard>Damn, I need my inhaler.

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,980
<4-4,Amy>你别跟着抽就好啦
<4-4,Amy>Just don't smoke.

114
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,680
<4-5,Leonard>不是  是我下楼跑太快
<4-5,Leonard>No, I went down the stairs too fast.

115
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,060
<4-7,Raj>别来医院  我们要回家了
<4-7,Raj>Don't come to the hospital. We're headed home.

116
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,530
<4-8,Penny>这也太快了  她是打喷嚏把孩子打出来了吗
<4-8,Penny>Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?

117
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,320
<4-9,Bernadette>我们太早就去医院了  有新情况再通知你
<4-9,Bernadette>We showed up too early. We'll keep you posted.

118
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,780
<4-10,Penny>好吧  那我们之后再联系  再见
<4-10,Penny>Okay, well, we'll talk to you guys later. Bye.

119
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,390
<4-10,Penny>她说先别去  还得一阵子
<4-10,Penny>She said not to come. It's gonna be a while.

120
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,000
<4-11,Amy>第一胎是有可能拖很久
<4-11,Amy>Well, first deliveries can be slow.

121
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,290
<4-12,Sheldon>我开始犹豫买给这孩子的闪电侠哈衣对不对了
<4-12,Sheldon>I am starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.

122
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,610
<4-13,Leonard>我找到了  但是里面空了
<4-13,Leonard>I found it, but it's empty.

123
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,470
<4-14,Penny>无所谓了  我们现在先不去医院了
<4-14,Penny>Well, it doesn't matter. We're not going to the hospital now.

124
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,300
<4-15,Leonard>你确定吗  我还挺想去的
<4-15,Leonard>Are you sure? I'd really like to.

125
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,410
<4-16,Amy>那我们是不是要...  再回去啊
<4-16,Amy>Well, should we, uh, head back up?

126
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,720
<4-16,Amy>大家来嘛
<4-16,Amy>Come on, guys.

<4-17,Penny>反正都起来了  一起去个小餐厅之类的啊
<4-17,Penny>We're all awake. Why don't we go to a diner or something?

128
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,160
<4-18,Amy>不知道啊
<4-18,Amy>Oh, uh, I don't know.

129
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,260
<4-18,Amy>谢尔顿  你不想去的  对吧
<4-18,Amy>Sheldon, you don't want to do that, do you?

130
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,360
<4-19,Sheldon>我想不想去不是重点啊
<4-19,Sheldon>It doesn't matter what I want.

<4-25,Penny>The annual birthday booty spectacular!

138
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,750
<4-26,Sheldon>你这样有点幼稚了吧
<4-26,Sheldon>That's a bit childish, isn't it?

139
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,680
<4-27,Penny>真不好意思啊  你的泡泡糖雪茄啥口味来着
<4-27,Penny>I'm sorry, and what flavor is your bubble gum cigar?

140
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,710
<4-28,Sheldon>葡萄  这口味最温和
<4-28,Sheldon>Grape. I find it the most mild.

141
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,510
<4-29,Penny>好吧  你们俩去好好快活
<4-29,Penny>All right, well, you two go have fun.

<4-30,Leonard>如果我找到备用药  我们也能快活一把
<4-30,Leonard>If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.

<4-31,Penny>你个性感气喘吁吁小家伙
<4-31,Penny>Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.

<5-1,Bernadette>真的有需要录下来吗
<5-1,Bernadette>Do you really need to record this?

147
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,510

148
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,090

<5-2,Raj>And here's your daddy.

150
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,140
<5-2,Raj>当他想骗你说他过去很酷的时候
<5-2,Raj>When he tries to tell you he used to be cool,

151
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,600
<5-2,Raj>你可以眼见为实知道他并不酷
<5-2,Raj>you can see he wasn't.

152
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,040
<5-3,Howard>好了好了  别录了
<5-3,Howard>All right, enough with the camera.

153
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,280
<5-4,Raj>这又不是为我录的  是为宝宝录的
<5-4,Raj>Well, this is not for me. This is for the baby.

154
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,260
<5-5,Howard>有一天她会想看的
<5-5,Howard>Some day she's gonna want to see this.

155
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,100
<5-5,Howard>不好意思
<5-5,Howard>I'm sorry.

156
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,530
<5-5,Howard>你说谁会想看的
<5-5,Howard>Who's gonna want to see this?

157
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
<5-6,Raj>我说的是"她"
<5-6,Raj>I-I said she,

158
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,860
<5-6,Raj>但好多事物都是用"她"指代的
<5-6,Raj>but lots of things are she --

159
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,940
<5-6,Raj>比如船啊  车啊
<5-6,Raj>boats and cars,

160
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,130
<5-6,Raj>鲸鱼啊  比如  "瞧她喷水啦"
<5-6,Raj>whales. Like, thar she blows.

161
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,360
<5-7,Stuart>圆场圆得好极了
<5-7,Stuart>You're doing great.

162
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,870
<5-8,Bernadette>拉杰
<5-8,Bernadette>Raj!

163
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,870
<5-9,Raj>好吧  我先不录了
<5-9,Raj>Well, okay, I'm gonna sign off now.

164
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,470
<5-9,Raj>接下来这部分可能包含一些儿童不宜的语言
<5-9,Raj>This next part may contain some adult language.

165
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,120
<5-10,Bernadette>你怎么能这样
<5-10,Bernadette>How could you?!

166
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,980
<5-11,Howard>我们坚持到现在都不知道宝宝性别
<5-11,Howard>We made it this far without knowing,

167
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,030
<5-11,Howard>全被你毁了
<5-11,Howard>and you ruined it!

168
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,730
<5-12,Raj>你们根本不知道守着这么大个秘密
<5-12,Raj>Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is

169
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,270
<5-12,Raj>却谁也不能告诉有多难
<5-12,Raj>to know something like this and not say it!

170
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,900
<5-13,Stuart>你早就告诉我是女儿了  我就没泄密
<5-13,Stuart>You told me it was a girl, and I didn't say it.

171
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,910
<5-15,Raj>-拉杰  -你不该说出来的
<5-15,Raj>- Raj! - You were supposed to keep that to yourself.

172
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,670
<5-16,Stuart>是啊  看来是挺难的
<5-16,Stuart>Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.

173
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,520
<6-1,Amy>那个  我们之前进行到哪了
<6-1,Amy>So... where were we?

174
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,920
<6-2,Sheldon>我很肯定
<6-2,Sheldon>Well, I believe

175
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,750
<6-2,Sheldon>我们之前正像欲求不满的青少年那样热吻
<6-2,Sheldon>we were kissing like randy teenagers,

176
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,890
<6-2,Sheldon>你的鼻子因为不通气轻轻地发出吹哨声
<6-2,Sheldon>and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.

177
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,220
<6-3,Amy>不好意思啊
<6-3,Amy>I'm sorry.

178
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,180
<6-4,Sheldon>没关系的
<6-4,Sheldon>Oh, don't be.

179
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,790
<6-4,Sheldon>你就像一只性感的茶壶
<6-4,Sheldon>You were like a foxy tea kettle.

180
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,420
<6-5,Amy>我们要重头来过吗
<6-5,Amy>Well, shall we start over?

181
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,220
<6-6,Sheldon>好的
<6-6,Sheldon>Very well.

182
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,970
<6-7,Amy>哪里不对头吗
<6-7,Amy>What's wrong?

183
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,830
<6-8,Sheldon>我也说不好
<6-8,Sheldon>I'm not sure.

184
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,550
<6-8,Sheldon>今晚早些时候  我们是自然而然开始的
<6-8,Sheldon>Earlier tonight, things began organically,

185
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,710
<6-8,Sheldon>现在感觉是为了做而做
<6-8,Sheldon>and now it's feeling forced,

186
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,710
<6-8,Sheldon>就像电影《加勒比海盗》那些续集一样
<6-8,Sheldon>like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.

187
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,250
<6-9,Amy>好吧  这么说也有道理
<6-9,Amy>Okay, that makes sense.

188
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,280
<6-9,Amy>气氛的确是有点变了
<6-9,Amy>I mean, the mood's a little different now.

189
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,320
<6-9,Amy>我们不必急着做的
<6-9,Amy>We-we don't have to rush.

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
<6-9,Amy>我知道
<6-9,Amy>Oh, I know,

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,510
<6-10,Sheldon>但莱纳德和佩妮以为我们已经开搞了
<6-10,Sheldon>but Leonard and Penny think we're doing it,

192
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,100
<6-10,Sheldon>我不想让他们失望
<6-10,Sheldon>and I don't want to disappoint them.

193
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,210
<6-11,Amy>气氛继续急转直下
<6-11,Amy>And the mood continues to change.

194
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,200
<6-12,Sheldon>不是的  我当然也不想让你失望  我
<6-12,Sheldon>No, and also, I don't want to disappoint you. I...

195
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,350
<6-12,Sheldon>来吧  今天是你生日
<6-12,Sheldon>You know, come on. It's your birthday.

196
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,870
<6-12,Sheldon>我能咬牙挺过去
<6-12,Sheldon>I can soldier through this.

197
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,990
<6-13,Amy>等一下
<6-13,Amy>H-Hold on.

198
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,680
<6-13,Amy>我觉得我有份小惊喜
<6-13,Amy>I think I might have a little surprise

199
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,610
<6-13,Amy>或许能帮我们重回正轨
<6-13,Amy>that might help get things back on track.

200
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,290
<6-14,Sheldon>真撩人
<6-14,Sheldon>Intriguing.

201
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,500
<6-14,Sheldon>"重回正轨"是不是提示我
<6-14,Sheldon>Is back on track a hint

202
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,780
<6-14,Sheldon>小惊喜和火车有关
<6-14,Sheldon>that it has something to do with trains?

203
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,010
<6-15,Amy>不是
<6-15,Amy>No.

204
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,380
<6-16,Sheldon>因为如果和火车有关
<6-16,Sheldon>Because if it did have to do with trains,

205
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,660
<6-16,Sheldon>-而你又要  -和火车没关系
<6-16,Sheldon>- and you were gonna give... - It's not about trains!

206
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,420
<6-18,Sheldon>连东方快车的舒适软卧都...
<6-18,Sheldon>Oh. Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express...

207
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,780
<6-19,Amy>别再提火车了
<6-19,Amy>Stop talking about trains!

208
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,370
<6-20,Sheldon>还嫌别人破坏气氛呢
<6-20,Sheldon>Who's killing the mood now?

209
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,560
<7-1,Leonard>我找到备用气喘药了  想爱爱吗
<7-1,Leonard>Found the backup inhaler. Want to have sex?

210
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,190
<7-2,Penny>听到你这么说不想也想了
<7-2,Penny>Well, I didn't until I heard that.

211
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,250
<7-3,Leonard>等一下  药还得憋几秒
<7-3,Leonard>Hang on. I'm counting.

212
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,590
<7-3,Leonard>好了
<7-3,Leonard>It's okay. Mm.

213
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,930
<7-4,Raj (off)>有人在家吗
<7-4,Raj (off)>Hello!

214
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,500
<7-4,Raj (off)>霍华德和伯纳黛特把我踢出来了
<7-4,Raj (off)>Howard and Bernadette kicked me out

215
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,190
<7-4,Raj (off)>因为我告诉他们宝宝是女儿
<7-4,Raj (off)>because I told them they're having a girl!

216
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,110
<7-4,Raj (off)>糟糕  又说漏嘴了
<7-4,Raj (off)>Oopsy, I did it again.

217
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,330
<7-5,Penny>如果我们不出声  或许他会离开
<7-5,Penny>Maybe if we're quiet, he'll go away.

218
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,960
<7-6,Raj>可你这不就出声了吗
<7-6,Raj>You're gonna have to be quieter than that.

219
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,950
<8-1,Sheldon>我能睁开眼睛了吗
<8-1,Sheldon>Can I look yet?

220
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,400
<8-2,Amy>马上
<8-2,Amy>One second.

221
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,200
<8-2,Amy>好了  你可以睁开眼睛了
<8-2,Amy>All right, you can open your eyes.

222
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,150
<8-2,Amy>我想就让哈利·波特的魔法
<8-2,Amy>I thought I'd let Harry Potter

223
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,890
<8-2,Amy>让气氛变得"特"辣热起来吧
<8-2,Amy>make things hotter.

224
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,880
<8-3,Sheldon>要命了
<8-3,Sheldon>Wowza.

225
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,770
<8-4,Amy>我给你买了葛莱芬多的长袍
<8-4,Amy>I got a Gryffindor robe for you.

226
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,020
<8-5,Sheldon>葛莱芬多的人和赫奇帕奇的人搞在一起
<8-5,Sheldon>A Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff?

227
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,020
<8-5,Sheldon>竟有这等桃色丑闻
<8-5,Sheldon>How scandalous.

228
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,590
<8-5,Sheldon>你个淘气丫头
<8-5,Sheldon>You naughty girl.

229
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,590
<8-5,Sheldon>你居然不带我自己去了魔法世界
<8-5,Sheldon>You went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.

231
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,880
<8-6,Amy>没错
<8-6,Amy>I did.

232
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,660
<8-6,Amy>我惹上麻烦了吗
<8-6,Amy>Am I in trouble?

233
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,450
<8-7,Sheldon>你麻烦大了
<8-7,Sheldon>Yes, you're in trouble --

234
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,530
<8-7,Sheldon>你居然不带我自己去魔法世界
<8-7,Sheldon>you went to Wizarding World without me!

235
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,220
<8-8,Amy>等等  怎么风云突变
<8-8,Amy>Wait, what just happened?

236
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,400
<8-9,Sheldon>你明知道我一直想去的
<8-9,Sheldon>You know I've been wanting to go.

237
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,940
<8-10,Amy>谢尔顿  你真的想在我生日这天
<8-10,Amy>Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me

238
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,370
<8-10,Amy>和我吵架吗
<8-10,Amy>on my birthday?

239
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,760
<8-11,Sheldon>你说得对
<8-11,Sheldon>Oh, you're right.

240
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,410
<8-11,Sheldon>对不起
<8-11,Sheldon>I'm sorry.

241
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,300
<8-12,Amy>祝我生日快乐
<8-12,Amy>Ooh. Happy birthday to me.

242
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,700
<8-13,Raj (off)>有人在家吗
<8-13,Raj (off)>Hello...

243
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,550
<8-14,Amy>是宝宝有新情况了吗
<8-14,Amy>Is this about the baby?

244
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,270
<8-15,Raj>不  只是我走到哪都被人拒之门外
<8-15,Raj>No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.

245
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,660
<8-16,Amy>很好  反正你都习惯了
<8-16,Amy>Good. Then you're used to this.

246
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,420
<8-17,Penny>伯纳黛特的羊水破了
<8-17,Penny>Hey, Bernadette's water broke!

247
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,960
<8-18,Leonard>快走  都到医院去
<8-18,Leonard>Come on! Everyone to the hospital!

248
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,140
<8-19,Amy>有没有搞错
<8-19,Amy>You have got to be kidding me!

249
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,810
<9-1,Howard>试着放松点  我们随时就到
<9-1,Howard>Just try to relax. We'll be there any minute.

250
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,010
<9-1,Howard>斯图尔特  别再像老头子一样开车了
<9-1,Howard>Stuart, stop driving like an old man.

251
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,050
<9-1,Howard>开快点
<9-1,Howard>Speed it up a little.

252
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,650
<9-2,Stuart>我才不是老头子
<9-2,Stuart>I'm not an old man!

253
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,700
<9-2,Stuart>我只是一到晚上就看不清楚
<9-2,Stuart>I just can't see at night.

254
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,880
<9-2,Stuart>又开始宫缩了
<9-2,Stuart>Here comes another one.

255
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,530
<9-3,Bernadette>老斜眼  右边那个才是油门
<9-3,Bernadette>Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal's on the right!

256
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,870
<9-4,Stuart>好吧  坐稳了
<9-4,Stuart>All right, hang on.

257
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,160
<9-4,Stuart>如果你看到前面有路人  叫他们闪开
<9-4,Stuart>If you see any pedestrians, just call 'em out.

258
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,420
<9-4,Stuart>霍华德和伯纳黛特的宝宝
<9-4,Stuart>Howard and Bernadette's kid

259
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,790
<10-1,Penny>可能在你的生日出生
<10-1,Penny>might be born on your birthday.

260
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,060
<10-1,Penny>这很酷吧
<10-1,Penny>How cool is that?

261
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,260
<10-3,Raj>是啊  但我以为这个宝宝本该毁掉的
<10-3,Raj>Yeah, but I thought this baby was supposed to ruin

262
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,090
<10-4,Leonard>是他们的性生活  不是我的
<10-4,Leonard>their sex life, not mine.

263
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,250
<10-3,Raj>这一天和我想象得一点都不一样
<10-3,Raj>This is not how I imagined this day going --

264
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,150
<10-3,Raj>此时此刻我应该陪在他们身边的
<10-3,Raj>I should be with them right now.

265
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,840
<10-4,Leonard>可这是他们的宝宝啊
<10-4,Leonard>Well, it is their child.

266
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,060
<10-4,Leonard>我当然明白
<10-4,Leonard>I know that.

267
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,890
<10-5,Raj>但平心而论  我花了九个月时间
<10-5,Raj>But to be fair, I've spent nine months

268
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,380
<10-5,Raj>帮助伯纳黛特做好迎接宝宝的准备
<10-5,Raj>helping Bernadette get ready for this baby.

269
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,690
<10-5,Raj>霍华德不过花了五分钟让她怀上宝宝而已
<10-5,Raj>And Howard spent five minutes conceiving it.

270
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,040
<10-5,Raj>说五分钟都是给他面子了
<10-5,Raj>And I'm being generous.

271
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,130
<10-5,Raj>才五分钟
<10-5,Raj>Five minutes?

272
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,610
<10-6,Sheldon>我们肯定哪里做错了
<10-6,Sheldon>We must be doing it wrong.

273
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,320
<10-6,Sheldon>我们一做好几个小时呢
<10-6,Sheldon>It took us hours.

274
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,260
<10-7,Raj>最糟糕的部分是
<10-7,Raj>And-and the worst part is

275
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,130
<10-7,Raj>他们居然把我赶走  让斯图尔特留下
<10-7,Raj>that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.

276
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,630
<10-8,Amy>我理解你  但这特别的一天是属于他们的
<10-8,Amy>I understand, but this is a special day for them.

277
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,220
<10-8,Amy>你能不能别再计较了
<10-8,Amy>Can you just try and let it go?

278
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,660
<10-8,Amy>她说得对
<10-8,Amy>She's right.

279
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,680
<10-9,Sheldon>我刚刚得知艾米不带我自己去了主题公园
<10-9,Sheldon>You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me,

280
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,640
<10-9,Sheldon>但我不会毁了她的生日
<10-9,Sheldon>but I'm not going to ruin her birthday.

281
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,640
<10-9,Sheldon>我会等  在接下来一年里
<10-9,Sheldon>I'll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours

282
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,370
<10-9,Sheldon>一次一小时  不定时毁足她24小时
<10-9,Sheldon>sprinkled throughout the year.

283
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,040
<11-1,Howard>深呼吸  慢慢地呼吸
<11-1,Howard>Deep breaths, slow breaths.

284
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,930
<11-2,Bernadette>我还是很渴  再给我点碎冰
<11-2,Bernadette>I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.

285
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,760
<11-3,Stuart>抱歉  我以为这是随屋赠送的碎冰
<11-3,Stuart>Sorry. I... thought these were room ice chips.

286
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,490
<11-3,Stuart>我去再拿些来
<11-3,Stuart>I'll go get some more.

287
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,410
<11-4,Howard>斯图尔特  既然你出去了
<11-4,Howard>Uh, Stuart, while you're out there,

288
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,390
<11-4,Howard>就不用回来了
<11-4,Howard>don't come back.

289
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,530
<11-5,Stuart>好
<11-5,Stuart>Okay.

290
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,830
<11-6,Howard>我们给这孩子取什么名字呢
<11-6,Howard>So, what are we gonna name this kid?

291
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,640
<11-6,Howard>现在我们知道了是女孩
<11-6,Howard>Now that we know she's a girl,

292
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,780
<11-6,Howard>沃利·沃罗威茨这名字算是泡汤了
<11-6,Howard>it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.

293
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,070
<11-7,Bernadette>可以用你妈妈的名字
<11-7,Bernadette>Could name her after your mom.

294
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,580
<11-8,Howard>黛比
<11-8,Howard>Debbie?

295
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,070
<11-8,Howard>算了
<11-8,Howard>No.

296
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,540
<11-8,Howard>她讨厌这个名字
<11-8,Howard>She hated that name.

297
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,150
<11-9,Bernadette>她有中间名吗
<11-9,Bernadette>Did she have a middle name?

298
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,390
<11-10,Howard>玛尔维娜
<11-10,Howard>Melvina.

299
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,830
<11-11,Bernadette>我们继续想想
<11-11,Bernadette>Let's keep thinking.

300
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,300
<11-12,Howard>真讨厌  她不能在这陪着我们
<11-12,Howard>It sucks that she's not here.

301
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,520
<11-13,Bernadette>我懂
<11-13,Bernadette>I know.

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,470
<11-14,Howard>她还在的话  一定会是最棒的奶奶
<11-14,Howard>She would've been the best grandma.

303
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,090
<11-15,Bernadette>她的口袋里的确总是有糖果
<11-15,Bernadette>She did always have candy in her pocket.

304
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,430
<11-15,Bernadette>是啊
<11-15,Bernadette>Yeah.

305
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,490
<11-16,Howard>我到20岁时才明白
<11-16,Howard>I was 20 years old before I figured out

306
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,250
<11-16,Howard>巧克力卷并不是自带温度的
<11-16,Howard>Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.

307
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,670
<11-17,Bernadette>我刚认识她五分钟  她就问我
<11-17,Bernadette>I didn't know her five minutes and she asked,

308
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,660
<11-17,Bernadette>你爱吃星河巧克力还是士力架
<11-17,Bernadette>Are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?

309
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,440
<11-18,Howard>谢天谢地你答对了  否则我们现在哪能在这里啊
<11-18,Howard>Thank God you answered right, we wouldn't be here today.

310
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,230
<12-1,Leonard>真难相信霍华德要做父亲了
<12-1,Leonard>It's hard to believe Howard's having a kid.

311
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
<12-1,Leonard>就是
<12-1,Leonard>Yeah.

312
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,280
<12-2,Amy>佩妮  是你把妮妮介绍给他的
<12-2,Amy>Penny, you're the one who introduced him to Bernie.

313
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,240
<12-3,Penny>我得说多少次对不起才行啊
<12-3,Penny>How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

314
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,580
<12-4,Leonard>不仅是霍华德和伯纳黛特
<12-4,Leonard>It's not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean,

315
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,160
<12-4,Leonard>看看我们的变化
<12-4,Leonard>look how far we've all come.

316
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,390
<12-5,Stuart>你俩结婚了
<12-5,Stuart>You two got married.

317
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,480
<12-6,Amy>谢尔顿和我同居了
<12-6,Amy>Sheldon and I are living together.

318
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,980
<12-7,Sheldon>但如果我妈问起  就说我们睡的上下铺
<12-7,Sheldon>But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.

319
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,460
<12-8,Leonard>我们刚认识时  佩妮是个落魄的小演员
<12-8,Leonard>Penny was a struggling actress when we met,

320
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,410
<12-8,Leonard>现在她是成功的医药代表
<12-8,Leonard>and now she's a successful pharmaceutical rep.

321
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,230
<12-9,Penny>你不用每次都强调落魄
<12-9,Penny>Okay, you don't have to say struggling every time.

322
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,030
<12-9,Penny>说演员就行
<12-9,Penny>You can just say actress.

323
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,870
<12-10,Stuart>霍华德上过太空
<12-10,Stuart>Howard went to space.

324
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,480
<12-11,Amy>伯纳黛特获得了博士学位
<12-11,Amy>Bernadette got her doctorate.

325
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,040
<12-12,Leonard>谢尔顿  霍华德和我在为政府做
<12-12,Leonard>Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government

326
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,810
<12-12,Leonard>量子陀螺仪
<12-12,Leonard>on our quantum gyroscope.

327
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,770
<12-13,Amy>我们都有了长足的进步
<12-13,Amy>We've all come a long way.

328
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,620
<12-13,Amy>很多都值得骄傲
<12-13,Amy>There's a lot to be proud of.

329
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,610
<12-14,Raj>老天爷  你们干脆一刀捅死小爷算了
<12-14,Raj>For God's sake, just drive in the knife, why don't you!

330
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,700
<12-15,Stuart>-你发什么疯  -你们都认为
<12-15,Stuart>- What's your problem? - Well, you're all thinking

331
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,910
<12-16,Raj>我是唯一一个没有任何建树的人
<12-16,Raj>that I'm the only one who hasn't done anything worthwhile.

332
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,610
<12-17,Sheldon>我没这样想
<12-17,Sheldon>I was not thinking it.

333
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,380
<12-17,Sheldon>不过既然你自己挑明了  这的确是不可否认的事实
<12-17,Sheldon>Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,500
<12-18,Stuart>拉杰  希望这话能让你心理平衡一些
<12-18,Stuart>Raj, if it's any consolation,

335
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,480
<12-18,Stuart>我和十年前混得一样惨
<12-18,Stuart>I'm no better off than I was ten years ago.

336
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,120
<12-19,Raj>好棒
<12-19,Raj>Oh, yay!

337
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,710
<12-19,Raj>我是天体物理学的博士
<12-19,Raj>I have a doctorate in astrophysics

338
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,850
<12-19,Raj>我和面色苍白的
<12-19,Raj>and I'm every bit as awesome

339
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,280
<12-19,Raj>漫画店老板一样"优秀"
<12-19,Raj>as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store!

340
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,500
<12-20,Sheldon>拉杰  有点同情心好吗
<12-20,Sheldon>Raj! Show some compassion.

341
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,330
<12-20,Sheldon>这些话只能想  不能说出来
<12-20,Sheldon>Those are things that we think but don't say.

342
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,830
<12-21,Raj>失陪了
<12-21,Raj>Excuse me.

343
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,320
<12-22,Leonard>抱歉  斯图尔特
<12-22,Leonard>Sorry, Stuart.

344
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,740
<12-23,Stuart>我在医院  但不是病人
<12-23,Stuart>Hey, I'm in a hospital and I'm not the patient.

345
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,040
<12-23,Stuart>我乐着呢
<12-23,Stuart>I'm fine.

346
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,770
<13-1,Howard>好了  妮妮  呼吸
<13-1,Howard>Come on, Bernie, breathe.

347
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,690
<13-1,Howard>还记得在生产课上学的吗
<13-1,Howard>Remember what you learned in birthing class.

348
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,720
<13-2,Bernadette>我记得我觉得这样做很傻逼
<13-2,Bernadette>I remember thinking, this is stupid,

349
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,070
<13-2,Bernadette>我是对的
<13-2,Bernadette>and I was right!

350
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,030
<13-3,Howard>要我叫护士吗
<13-3,Howard>Do you want me to get the nurse?

351
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,010
<13-4,Bernadette>不要  再有人胆敢将手指靠近我的子宫
<13-4,Bernadette>No! If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus,

352
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,600
<13-4,Bernadette>我会用"夺命剪刀脚"将手指掰断
<13-4,Bernadette>I'm gonna cross my legs and snap 'em off!

353
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,090
<13-4,Bernadette>我与父母的关系得到了缓解
<13-4,Bernadette>I've come to peace with my relationship with my parents.

354
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,170
<14-1,Leonard>对我来说这是重要的里程碑
<14-1,Leonard>That was a big milestone for me.

355
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,250
<14-2,Sheldon>说到个人成长
<14-2,Sheldon>Oh, speaking of personal growth,

356
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,160
<14-2,Sheldon>我最近尝试吃了瑞士甜菜
<14-2,Sheldon>I recently tried eating Swiss chard.

357
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,310
<14-2,Sheldon>我只嚼没咽  但艾米说这样就很棒了
<14-2,Sheldon>You know, I didn't swallow it, but Amy said it counted.

358
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,190
<14-4,Stuart>依然是废柴吗  还是说你离开的这段时间
<14-4,Stuart>Still a loser or did you turn things around

359
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,590
<14-4,Stuart>扭转乾坤  咸鱼翻身
<14-4,Stuart>while you were gone?

360
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,110
<14-5,Penny>拉杰  亲爱的
<14-5,Penny>You know, Raj, honey,

361
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,560
<14-5,Penny>你对自己太严苛了
<14-5,Penny>you're being too hard on yourself.

362
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,860
<14-5,Penny>我刚认识你时  你甚至不敢跟女人说话
<14-5,Penny>When I first met you, you couldn't even talk to women.

363
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,280
<14-5,Penny>只要房间里有一个女人  你就不敢出声
<14-5,Penny>I mean, you couldn't even talk if one was in the room.

364
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,280
<14-6,Raj>很好  现在我可以说
<14-6,Raj>Oh, great, now I can say

365
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,790
<14-6,Raj>"我真不敢相信你要和我分手"
<14-6,Raj>things like I can't believe you're breaking up with me.

366
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,070
<14-6,Raj>"你为什么和我分手"
<14-6,Raj>Why are you breaking up with me,

367
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,860
<14-6,Raj>"是  我还是会帮你搬家的"
<14-6,Raj>Yes, I'll still help you move.

368
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,170
<14-7,Penny>还有人想试试吗
<14-7,Penny>Anyone else want to try?

369
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,750
<14-8,Stuart>我有话要说
<14-8,Stuart>Uh, yeah, I got something.

370
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,370
<14-8,Stuart>拉杰
<14-8,Stuart>Raj,

371
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,540
<14-8,Stuart>不是所有人  都能做狗的主人
<14-8,Stuart>not everybody could be a dog owner.

372
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,340
<14-8,Stuart>怎么啦  你的狗狗也和你分手了吗
<14-8,Stuart>Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?

373
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,190
<14-9,Penny>我在自动贩卖机买了巧克力豆
<14-9,Penny>Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine

374
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,840
<14-9,Penny>结果出来两包
<14-9,Penny>and two bags came out.

375
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,450
<14-10,Raj>第一包是我买的
<14-10,Raj>I bought the first one,

376
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,680
<14-10,Raj>投币后没出来
<14-10,Raj>it didn't fall.

377

<14-12,Howard>她出生了  宝宝出生了
<14-12,Howard>She's here, the baby's here!

379
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,480
<14-14,Raj>恭喜了
<14-14,Raj>Congratulations!

380
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,820
<14-15,Amy>伯纳黛特好吗
<14-15,Amy>How's Bernadette?

381
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,200
<14-16,Howard>很累  但是很好
<14-16,Howard>Tired, but great.

382
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,940
<14-16,Howard>母女都平安
<14-16,Howard>They're both great.

383
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,390
<14-17,Penny>给宝宝取了名字吗
