5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,930
<1-1,Sheldon>将军
<1-1,Sheldon>Checkmate.

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,290
<1-2,Leonard>-又将?  -显然
<1-2,Leonard>-again? -obviously,

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,280
<1-3,Sheldon>你还不够格来玩三维国际象棋
<1-3,Sheldon>You're not well suited for three-dimensional chess.

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,830
<1-3,Sheldon>你的速度或许更适合玩三维糖果盒游戏
<1-3,Sheldon>Perhaps three-dimensional candy land would be more your speed.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,440
<1-4,Leonard>这盘重来
<1-4,Leonard>Just reset the board.

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,660
<1-5,Sheldon>这么多层都得我让你  还真丢脸啊
<1-5,Sheldon>It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,620
<1-6,Penny (knocking and entering)>好  伙计们
<1-6,Penny (knocking and entering)>Hey, guys.

12
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,310
<1-8,Penny>-你拿了我的邮件了?  -是  在这
<1-8,Penny>-did you get my mail? -yeah, right here.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,960
<1-9,Leonard>-内布拉斯加那边怎样?  -比北达科他州强
<1-9,Leonard>-how was nebraska? -well, better than north dakota.

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,370
<1-10,Penny>我猜这笑话只有在内布拉斯加州才会好笑
<1-10,Penny>I guess that joke's only funny in nebraska.

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,990
<1-11,Sheldon>就目前的数据来说  你还不能得出这结论
<1-11,Sheldon>From the data at hand, you really can't draw that conclusion.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,150
<1-11,Sheldon>你所能唯一确定的是
<1-11,Sheldon>All you can say with absolute certainty is that

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,150
<1-11,Sheldon>这笑话在这儿不好笑
<1-11,Sheldon>that joke is not funny here.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,950
<1-12,Penny>兄弟们  回来真好
<1-12,Penny>Boy, it's good to be back.

19
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,970
<1-13,Leonard>-你家人怎么样?  -这趟旅行简直不能再糟了
<1-13,Leonard>-how's your family? -it was the worst trip.

20
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,780
<1-14,Penny>一个周末下来家里人全病了
<1-14,Penny>Everyone got sick over the weekend.

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,770
<1-16,Leonard>-病了?  -又来了
<1-16,Leonard>-sick? -here we go.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,860
<1-17,Sheldon (running to opposite side of the room)>什么病?
<1-17,Sheldon (running to opposite side of the room)>What kind of sick?

23
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,210
<1-18,Penny>我猜  就是流感吧
<1-18,Penny>The flu, I guess.

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,570
<1-19,Sheldon>我不是要你猜  我要你确定
<1-19,Sheldon>I don't need you to guess. I need you to know.

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,220
<1-19,Sheldon>第一次出现症状是在什么时候
<1-19,Sheldon>Now, when did the symptoms first appear?

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,510
<1-20,Penny>大概是周五
<1-20,Penny>Maybe friday.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,100
<1-21,Sheldon>周五  上午还是下午?
<1-21,Sheldon>Friday. was that morning or afternoon?

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,880
<1-22,Penny>我...我不...
<1-22,Penny>I-i don't...

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,770
<1-23,Sheldon>小姐  好好想想  是谁  在什么时候擦过鼻子?
<1-23,Sheldon>Think, woman. who blew their nose and when?

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,250
<1-24,Leonard>没事的  谢尔顿
<1-24,Leonard>Sheldon, relax.

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,020
<1-24,Leonard>她没有任何症状  我确定她不会传染
<1-24,Leonard>She doesn't have any symptoms. I'm sure she's not contagious.

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,750
<1-24,Leonard>拜托
<1-24,Leonard>Oh, please.

33
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,560
<1-25,Sheldon>如果流感只有在症状出现后才会感染
<1-25,Sheldon>If influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear,

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,660
<1-25,Sheldon>那它早该在几千年前就消失了
<1-25,Sheldon>It would have died out thousands of years ago.

35
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,990
<1-25,Sheldon>在开始使用石器工具和创作洞穴壁画的年代
<1-25,Sheldon>Somewhere between tool using and cave painting,

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,070
<1-25,Sheldon>"能人"们肯定会想方设法
<1-25,Sheldon>Homo habilis would have figured out

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,790
<1-25,Sheldon>干掉流着鼻涕的家伙的
<1-25,Sheldon>how to kill the guy with the runny nose.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,520
<1-26,Leonard>潘妮  你要原谅谢尔顿  他有点病理恐惧
<1-26,Leonard>Penny, you'll have to excuse sheldon. he's a bit of a germaphobe.

39
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,080
<1-27,Penny>没关系  我能理解
<1-27,Penny>It's okay. I understand.

40
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,290
<1-28,Sheldon>谢谢你的照顾  现在请你离开
<1-28,Sheldon>Thanks for your consideration. now please leave.

41
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,760
<1-29,Leonard>你最好趁他还没拿来沙尔(消毒药水)来对着你喷的时候赶紧闪
<1-29,Leonard>You'd better go before he starts spraying you with lysol.

42
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,780
<1-30,Penny>好的  谢谢你替我拿邮件
<1-30,Penny>Okay. well, thank you for getting my mail.

43
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,950
<1-31,Leonard>小意思  欢迎回家
<1-31,Leonard>No problem. welcome home.

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,070
<1-32,Sheldon>怎么了?!
<1-32,Sheldon>What?!

45
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,840
<2-1,Leonard>你在搞什么鬼东西
<2-1,Leonard>What the hell are you doing?

46
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,220
<2-2,Sheldon>我在制作皮氏培养皿培养喉咙里的细菌
<2-2,Sheldon>I'm making petri dishes to grow throat cultures.

47
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,570
<2-3,Leonard>用酸橙果冻?
<2-3,Leonard>With lime jell-o?

48
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,020
<2-4,Sheldon>我需要一个(生长物)培养基
<2-4,Sheldon>I need a growth medium,

49
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,060
<2-4,Sheldon>而某人却把杏仁酸奶给扫荡一空了
<2-4,Sheldon>And someone polished off the apricot yogurt.

50
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,300
<2-4,Sheldon>来  从我喉咙里取些唾液
<2-4,Sheldon>Here, swab my throat.

51
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,750
<2-5,Leonard>我可不干
<2-5,Leonard>I don't think so.

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,930
<2-6,Sheldon>如果我要走在它前面搞定它
<2-6,Sheldon>If I'm going to get ahead of this thing,

53
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,110
<2-6,Sheldon>就必须弄清楚我喉咙里是什么东西在生长
<2-6,Sheldon>I need to find out what's growing in my throat.

54
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,620
<2-7,Leonard>谢尔顿  你没病
<2-7,Leonard>Sheldon, you are not sick.

55
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,680
<2-7,Leonard>这些行为有  但你没有
<2-7,Leonard>This is, but you are not.

56
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,230
<2-8,Sheldon>我们根本不清楚她带进屋子来的
<2-8,Sheldon>We have no idea what pathogen typhoid

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,710
<2-8,Sheldon>是什么伤寒病原体
<2-8,Sheldon>penny has introduced into our environment.

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,570
<2-8,Sheldon>鉴于我从没去过内布拉斯加
<2-8,Sheldon>For having never been to nebraska,

59
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,190
<2-8,Sheldon>我十分肯定我没有携带玉米外壳抗体
<2-8,Sheldon>I'm fairly certain that I have no corn-husking antibodies.

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,430
<2-9,Leonard>谢尔顿  你不觉得你反应过度了吗
<2-9,Leonard>Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?

61
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,380
<2-10,Sheldon>当我倒在医院昏迷不醒
<2-10,Sheldon>When I'm lying comatose in a hospital

62
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,240
<2-10,Sheldon>要靠那些低智商来医治我的时候
<2-10,Sheldon>relying on inferior minds to cure me,

63
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,540
<2-10,Sheldon>这些果冻培养细菌连同我的笔记
<2-10,Sheldon>These jell-o cultures and my accompanying notes

64
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,110
<2-10,Sheldon>会让他们有机会最后一搏
<2-10,Sheldon>Will give them a fighting chance.

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,700
<2-11,Leonard>-我回去睡觉了  -等等
<2-11,Leonard>-i'm going back to bed. -wait.

66
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,030
<2-12,Sheldon>-把这个放到卫生间  -干吗
<2-12,Sheldon>-put this in the bathroom. -what for?

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,170
<2-13,Leonard>我要测量我体液的摄取和排放情况
<2-13,Leonard>I need to measure my fluid intake and output

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,080
<2-14,Sheldon>确保我肾功能没有衰竭
<2-14,Sheldon>To make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.

69
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,950
<2-15,Leonard>这是我用来和糕饼的!
<2-15,Leonard>I mixed pancake batter in this!

70
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,440
<2-16,Sheldon>不  这个实验皿一直是用来盛小便的
<2-16,Sheldon>No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.

71
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,480
<2-17,Leonard>你有闲工夫把房间里的所有东西都贴上标签
<2-17,Leonard>You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment

72
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,130
<2-17,Leonard>即使标签笔都有标签
<2-17,Leonard>Including the label maker,

73
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,100
<2-17,Leonard>就不能抽出十秒钟把它标记上"小便皿"吗?
<2-17,Leonard>But you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said "urine cup"?

74
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,800
<2-18,Sheldon>这不在杯底嘛
<2-18,Sheldon>It's right here on the bottom.

75
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,480
<2-19,Leonard>我猜我该给贝蒂妙厨写封道歉信了
<2-19,Leonard>I guess I owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology.

76
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,430
<3-1,Sheldon>我的天呐
<3-1,Sheldon>Oh, dear god.

77
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,510
<3-1,Sheldon>里奥纳德  我病了!
<3-1,Sheldon>Leonard, I'm sick!

<4-1,Sheldon (voice off)>Leonard, I'm sick!

79
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,170
<4-2,Sheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet)>里奥纳德  我的加衬芯床罩掉了  我一弯腰鼻窦就疼
<4-2,Sheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet)>Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,290
<4-4,Sheldon>里奥纳德  你在哪呢
<4-4,Sheldon>-hey! -leonard, where are you?

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,180
<4-10,Sheldon>-怎么会  -他们叫我帮忙
<4-10,Sheldon>-why? -they asked me to come in.

85
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,370
<4-11,Leonard>我没听到电话响过啊
<4-11,Leonard>I didn't hear the phone ring.

86
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,460
<4-12,Sheldon>他们发的短信
<4-12,Sheldon>They texted me.

87
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,160
<4-14,Sheldon>是这样  跟我预测的如出一辙  我病了
<4-14,Sheldon>Well, as I predicted, I am sick.

88
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,760
<4-14,Sheldon>我的体温从凌晨两点开始就呈指数曲线上升
<4-14,Sheldon>My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2:00 a.m.,

89
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,170
<4-14,Sheldon>而且我痰中含血量惊人地高
<4-14,Sheldon>And I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.

90
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,710
<4-15,Leonard>开玩笑吧?
<4-15,Leonard>No kidding?

91
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,290
<4-16,Sheldon>没有  不仅如此
<4-16,Sheldon>No, not only that,

92
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,680
<4-16,Sheldon>痰的颜色也已经从透明变成牛奶绿了
<4-16,Sheldon>It has shifted from clear to milky green.

93
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,330
<4-16,Sheldon>好吧
<4-16,Sheldon>All right,

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,820
<4-17,Leonard>多休息  多喝点液体
<4-17,Leonard>Get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.

95

<4-18,Sheldon>我还能喝什么  气体  固体  还是电离等离子体?
<4-18,Sheldon>What else would I drink, gases, solids, ionized plasma?

130
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,260
<5-23,Howard (imitating his mother’s voice)>你为什么要在这么邪恶的时间来电话?
<5-23,Howard (imitating his mother’s voice)>Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?

131
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,190
<5-24,Sheldon>我要喝汤

<5-25,Howard>找你自己的妈妈去!
<5-25,Howard>Then call your own mother!

<5-27,Howard>I forgot the protocol we put in place

136
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:49,680
<5-27,Howard>我们定下的协议了
<5-27,Howard>after the great ear infection of 06.

<5-30,Howard’s Mother>I just had the carpet steamed!

142
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,800
<5-31,Howard>被否决了
<5-31,Howard>That's a negatory.

143
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,210
<5-31,Howard>但是今天电影展里会上演"决战猩球"全集
<5-31,Howard>But there's a planet of the apes marathon at the nuart today.

144
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,650
<5-32,Leonard>5部电影  每部2小时
<5-32,Leonard>Five movies, two hours apiece..

145
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,970
<5-32,Leonard>算是个开始
<5-32,Leonard>It's a start.

146
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,390
<6-1,Waitress>有个疯子加流浪汉  在18号桌
<6-1,Waitress>Homeless, crazy guy at table 18.

147
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,100
<6-2,Penny>不  只是疯子而已
<6-2,Penny>No, just crazy.

148
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,320
<6-2,Penny>谢尔顿  你在这里做什么?
<6-2,Penny>Sheldon, what are you doing here?

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,730
<6-3,Sheldon>我病了  非常感谢
<6-3,Sheldon>I'm sick. thank you very much.

150
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,060
<6-4,Penny>怎么会是我传染给你的呢?  我没有病
<6-4,Penny>How could you have gotten if from me? I'm not sick.

151
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,500
<6-5,Sheldon>你是携带者
<6-5,Sheldon>You're a carrier.

152
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,650
<6-5,Sheldon>这里的所有人都在劫难逃
<6-5,Sheldon>All these people here are doomed.

153
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,670
<6-5,Sheldon>你们在劫难逃啦!
<6-5,Sheldon>You're doomed!

154
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,050
<6-6,Penny>谢尔顿  你想要干什么?
<6-6,Penny>Sheldon, what do you want?

155
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,790
<6-7,Sheldon>我想要喝汤
<6-7,Sheldon>I want soup.

156
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,930
<6-8,Penny (over Sheldon’s strange throat clearance)>为什么你不...?
<6-8,Penny (over Sheldon’s strange throat clearance)>Why didn't you...?

157
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,090
<6-8,Penny (over Sheldon’s strange throat clearance)>为什么你不在家弄汤喝?
<6-8,Penny (over Sheldon’s strange throat clearance)>Why didn't you just have soup at home?

158
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,930
<6-9,Sheldon>潘妮  我的智商是187
<6-9,Sheldon>Penny, I have an iq of 187.

159
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,210
<6-9,Sheldon>你不会想想  如果我在家有办法
<6-9,Sheldon>Don't you imagine that if there were a way for me

160
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,180
<6-9,Sheldon>喝汤的话  你觉得我会来这里么?
<6-9,Sheldon>To have had soup at home, I would have thought of it?

161
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,600
<6-10,Penny>你可以叫外卖啊
<6-10,Penny>You can have soup delivered.

162
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,360
<6-11,Sheldon>这点我倒没想过
<6-11,Sheldon>I did not think of that.

163
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,600
<6-11,Sheldon>很明显  我已经处于发烧后的精神错乱状态了
<6-11,Sheldon>Clearly, febrile delirium is setting in.

164
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,100
<6-11,Sheldon>趁我还知道汤匙是做什么用
<6-11,Sheldon>Please bring me some soup

165
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,190
<6-11,Sheldon>请快给我上汤吧
<6-11,Sheldon>While I still understand what a spoon is for.

166
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,060
<6-12,Penny>你想要什么汤?
<6-12,Penny>What kind of soup do you want?

167
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,040
<6-13,Sheldon>我母亲过去给我做的汤  里面有切开的豌豆
<6-13,Sheldon>Well, my mother used to make me this split pea

<6-13,Sheldon>切片的法兰克福香肠和一些自制的油煎面包块
<6-13,Sheldon>With little frankfurter slices and these homemade croutons.

169
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,090
<6-14,Penny>我们有鸡汤  玉米汤  和土豆葱汤
<6-14,Penny>We have chicken, tortilla and potato leek.

170
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,280
<6-15,Sheldon>有没有什么汤里是放切片的法兰克福香肠
<6-15,Sheldon>Could I get any of those with little frankfurter slices

171
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,140
<6-16,Penny>和自制的油煎面包块的?  没有
<6-16,Penny>And homemade croutons?  No.

172
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,760
<6-17,Sheldon>那就给我个惊喜吧
<6-17,Sheldon>Then surprise me.

173
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,800
<6-17,Sheldon>你们觉得它是黄绿色还是树绿色?
<6-17,Sheldon>Would you call that "moss green" or "forest green"?

174
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,570
<7-1,Howard>看看  每个人都选了黑猩猩
<7-1,Howard>Look at this. everyone went chimp.

175
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,740
<7-2,Raj>我要指出我之前提议选的是人猿
<7-2,Raj>I'd like to point out that I voted for orangutan,

176
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,830
<7-2,Raj>但是被你给否决了!
<7-2,Raj>But you shouted me down!

177
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,600
<7-4,Penny>-潘妮  -你在哪呢?
<7-4,Penny>-hi, penny. -hey, where are you?

178
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,220
<7-5,Leonard>我在...工作
<7-5,Leonard>I'm... at work.

179
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,340
<7-6,Penny>你的声音很奇怪
<7-6,Penny>You sound funny.

180
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,950
<7-7,Leonard>我...我穿着反辐射工作服
<7-7,Leonard>Look. I'm... I'm in a radiation suit.

181
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,450
<7-8,Penny>-有什么事吗?  -我也在工作
<7-8,Penny>-what's up? -i'm at work, too,

182
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,660
<7-8,Penny>你绝对猜不到谁在这里用病菌感染着我整个工作区
<7-8,Penny>And you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.

183
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,990
<7-9,Leonard (To Howard and Raj)>谢尔顿在芝士蛋糕店
<7-9,Leonard (To Howard and Raj)>Sheldon's at the cheesecake factory.

184
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,040
<7-9,Leonard (To Howard and Raj)>-告诉他让他回家  -他不走
<7-9,Leonard (To Howard and Raj)>-just tell him to go home. -he won't leave.

185
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,970
<7-10,Penny>他怕他会晕倒在公车上
<7-10,Penny>He's afraid he'll pass out on the bus,

186
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,360
<7-10,Penny>然后有人会把他的器官割走
<7-10,Penny>And someone will harvest his organs.

187
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,120
<7-11,Leonard (To Howard and Raj)>他已经有妄想症状了  不过他已经找到了地方呆着
<7-11,Leonard (To Howard and Raj)>He's paranoid, and he's established a nest.

188
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,750
<7-12,Penny>你能过来接他吗?
<7-12,Penny>Can you please come get him?

<7-13,Leonard>我的天啊  辐射室出现裂缝了!
<7-13,Leonard>Oh, my god, there's a breach in the radiation unit!

191
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,300
<7-13,Leonard>整个城市要陷于危险中了!  我的天啊!
<7-13,Leonard>The whole city is in jeopardy! oh, my god!

192
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,350
<7-13,Leonard>安全壳已经开始融化了  不能说了  拜!
<7-13,Leonard>The containment vessel's melting. gotta go. bye!

193
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,180
<7-13,Leonard>我感到非常内疚
<7-13,Leonard>I feel really guilty.

194
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,750
<7-14,Raj>你做了你该做的
<7-14,Raj>You did what you had to do.

195
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,580
<7-15,Howard>把你的脏爪子从我的爆米花上移开
<7-15,Howard>Take your stinking paws off my popcorn,

196
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,060
<7-15,Howard>你个恶心可恶的大猩猩!
<7-15,Howard>You damn dirty ape!

197
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,290
<8-1,Sheldon>谢谢你带我回家
<8-1,Sheldon>Thanks for bringing me home.

198
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,630
<8-2,Penny>没关系  我今天不是很需要上班
<8-2,Penny>It's okay. I didn't really need to work today.

199
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,780
<8-2,Penny>反正我也没车和房子的贷款要缴
<8-2,Penny>It's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.

200
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,390
<8-3,Sheldon>好  那就好
<8-3,Sheldon>Good, good.

201
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,030
<8-4,Penny>好吧  祝你康复
<8-4,Penny>Okay, well, you feel better.

202
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,930
<8-5,Sheldon>等等!  你要去哪里?
<8-5,Sheldon>Wait! where are you going?

203
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,050
<8-6,Penny>回家...  去写一些空头支票
<8-6,Penny>Home... to write some bad checks.

204
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,090
<8-7,Sheldon>你就这样扔下我不管?
<8-7,Sheldon>You're going to leave me?

205
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,470
<8-8,Penny>谢尔顿  你已经长大了  你之前没生过病吗
<8-8,Penny>Sheldon, you are a grown man. haven't you ever been sick before?

206
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,300
<8-9,Sheldon>当然生过  不过有人照顾我啊
<8-9,Sheldon>Of course, but not by myself.

207
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,670
<8-10,Penny>真的?  从来没自己一人过?
<8-10,Penny>Really? never?

208
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
<8-11,Sheldon>有一次  我15岁
<8-11,Sheldon>Well, once, when I was 15,

209
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,450
<8-11,Sheldon>暑假的时候在德国的海德尔堡学院
<8-11,Sheldon>Spending the summer at the heidelberg institute in germany.

210
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,930
<8-12,Penny>出国留学?
<8-12,Penny>Studying abroad?

211
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,280
<8-13,Sheldon>不是  被邀请当客座教授
<8-13,Sheldon>No. visiting professor.

212
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,970
<8-13,Sheldon>总之  当地的烹饪方法用的香肠比我习惯的多了一些
<8-13,Sheldon>Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based

213
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,590
<8-13,Sheldon>结果就是肚子里上演了陆军联合闪电战
<8-13,Sheldon>Than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg,

214
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,320
<8-13,Sheldon>我的大肠扮演的是捷克斯洛伐克
<8-13,Sheldon>With my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia.

215
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,780
<8-14,Penny>当时没有人在那里照顾你么?
<8-14,Penny>And there was no one there to take care of you?

216
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,960
<8-15,Sheldon>我妈要飞回德克萨斯帮我爸爸的忙
<8-15,Sheldon>My mom had to fly back to texas to help my dad,

217
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,920
<8-15,Sheldon>因为房子的煤渣砖又塌方了
<8-15,Sheldon>Because the house had slipped off the cinder blocks again.

218
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,960
<8-17,Sheldon>-又?  -当时是狂风季节
<8-17,Sheldon>-again? -it was tornado season.

219
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,270
<8-17,Sheldon>那是个临时工棚
<8-17,Sheldon>And it was an aluminum house.

220
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,470
<8-17,Sheldon>当时学院公寓里的管家不会讲英文
<8-17,Sheldon>The housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any english.

221
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,890
<8-17,Sheldon>当我终于让她相信我生病了的时候
<8-17,Sheldon>When I finally managed to convince her I was sick,

222
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,090
<8-17,Sheldon>她说  "mochtest du eine darmspfilung?"
<8-17,Sheldon>She said,"mochtest du eine darmspfilung?"

223
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,230
<8-18,Penny>那是什么意思?
<8-18,Penny>What does that mean?

224
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,470
<8-19,Sheldon>根据之后发生的事  我认为意思是
<8-19,Sheldon>Based on what happened next, I assume it means,

225
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,500
<8-19,Sheldon>"你想要灌肠吗?"
<8-19,Sheldon>"would you like an enema?"

226
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,960
<8-20,Penny>好吧  亲爱的  我来照顾你吧
<8-20,Penny>Okay, sweetie. I'll take care of you.

227
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,920
<8-20,Penny>你需要我做什么
<8-20,Penny>What do you need?

228
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,830
<8-21,Sheldon>我妈妈常给我用海绵擦身
<8-21,Sheldon>My mom used to give me sponge baths.

229
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,630
<8-22,Penny>基本规则  禁止用海绵擦身
<8-22,Penny>Ok ground rules. No sponge baths,

230
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,160
<8-22,Penny>还有绝对禁止灌肠
<8-22,Penny>And definitely no enemas.

231
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,020

254
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,600
<9-12,Raj>还是在你的角膜上用激光切个奇怪的槽
<9-12,Raj>Or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?

<11-1,Leonard>你看到什么了?  我看不到
<11-1,Leonard>What do you see? I can't.

281
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,030
<11-2,Raj>客厅好像没人
<11-2,Raj>The living room appears to be empty.

282
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,800
<11-3,Leonard>他肯定在他卧室
<11-3,Leonard>He must be in his bedroom.

283
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,930
<11-3,Leonard>我的备用眼镜在我卧室的柜子上
<11-3,Leonard>My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser,

<11-3,Leonard>就挨着我的蝙蝠侠发光器
<11-3,Leonard>Next to my bat signal.

285
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,900
<11-4,Howard>我又不进去

<11-6,Raj>-拉杰?  -没门  伙计
<11-6,Raj>-raj? -no way, jose.

<11-7,Leonard>可是我没法去拿啊  我什么都看不到
<11-7,Leonard>But I can't do it. I can't see anything.

288
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,720
<11-8,Howard>那没关系  有无线迷你摄像头和蓝牙耳机
<11-8,Howard>It's all right. wireless minicam and bluetooth headset.

289
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,040
<11-8,Howard>我们就是你的眼睛
<11-8,Howard>We'll be your eyes.

290
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
<11-9,Leonard>好吧
<11-9,Leonard>Fine.

291
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,540
<11-10,Howard>还有个玩意儿
<11-10,Howard>One more thing.

292
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,320
<11-10,Howard>这是个次音速冲击传感器
<11-10,Howard>This is a subsonic impact sensor.

293
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,350
<11-10,Howard>如果谢尔顿下床并开始走路
<11-10,Howard>If sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk,

294
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,990
<11-10,Howard>这个器件会记录下来并把信号发回笔记本
<11-10,Howard>This device will register it and send a signal to the laptop.

295
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,470
<11-10,Howard>由此  根据这间公寓的地理结构
<11-10,Howard>At that point, based on the geography of the apartment

296
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,370
<11-10,Howard>和病猫谢尔顿的步行速度
<11-10,Howard>And the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon,

297
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,750
<11-10,Howard>你有7秒钟的时间出来  带眼镜或者不戴眼镜
<11-10,Howard>You'll have 7 seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.

298
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,780
<11-11,Leonard>我的脚步声不会干扰它判断吗?
<11-11,Leonard>Won't my footsteps set it off?

299
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,250
<11-12,Howard>不会  你只能用你的手和膝盖走路
<11-12,Howard>No. you'll be on your hands and knees.

300
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,240
<11-12,Howard>你要把这个传感器放到离谢尔顿尽可能近的地方
<11-12,Howard>You'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to sheldon's room.

301
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,320
<11-13,Leonard>我用手和膝盖走路我怎么带着这个玩意?
<11-13,Leonard>How do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?

302
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,660
<12-1,Howard>低一点
<12-1,Howard>Stay low.

303
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,660
<12-1,Howard>左转
<12-1,Howard>Bear left.

304
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,940
<12-1,Howard>-现在直给  -什么
<12-1,Howard>-now keep true. -what?

305
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,480
<12-4,Leonard>-意思是"一直走"  -说"一直走"不就得了
<12-4,Leonard>-it means "go straight." -then just say, "go straight."

306
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,100
<12-4,Leonard>你报方位的时候
<12-4,Leonard>You don't say, "go straight."

307
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,920
<12-5,Howard>不说"一直走"  是说"直给"
<12-5,Howard>When you're giving bearings, you say, "keep true."

308
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,850
<12-5,Howard>好吧
<12-5,Howard>All right.

309
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,470
<12-6,Leonard>我把头给撞了
<12-6,Leonard>I just hit my head.

310
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,010
<12-7,Howard>因为你没"直给"
<12-7,Howard>Because you didn't keep true.

311
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,250
<12-7,Howard>好啦  右转
<12-7,Howard>Okay, turn right.

312
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,380
<12-8,Raj>图像受损了
<12-8,Raj>The picture's breaking up.

313
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,480
<12-9,Howard>把你的脑袋往右斜
<12-9,Howard>Angle your head to the right.

314
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,180
<12-9,Howard>再来点儿
<12-9,Howard>Now, a little more.

315
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,890
<12-9,Howard>再来点儿
<12-9,Howard>Little more.

316
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,910
<12-9,Howard>好了  现在直给吧
<12-9,Howard>That's it. now, just keep true.

317
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,710
<12-9,Howard>你离谢尔顿的屋子已经很近了  可以部署传感器了
<12-9,Howard>You're close enough to sheldon's room. deploy the sensor.

318
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,700
<12-9,Howard>现在把它打开
<12-9,Howard>Now, turn it on.

319
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,650
<12-10,Leonard>它没开着吗?
<12-10,Leonard>It wasn't on?

320
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,790
<12-12,Leonard>那我干嘛还要爬着进来
<12-12,Leonard>Then why did I have to crawl?

321
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,870
<12-13,Howard>是  我想你可以不用
<12-13,Howard>No, I guess you didn't.

322
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,420
<12-14,Leonard>好了  打开了
<12-14,Leonard>Okay, it's on.

323
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,940
<12-15,Howard>好  从现在开始  你就得爬着走了
<12-15,Howard>Good. from this point forward, you will have to crawl.

324
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,900
<12-16,Leonard>明白
<12-16,Leonard>I know.

325
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,650
<12-17,Howard>等等  传感器探测到了什么  把头转回去
<12-17,Howard>Hang on, the sensor's picking up something. turn your head back.

326
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,680
<12-18,Penny>你真不是个东西
<12-18,Penny>You rat bastard.

327
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,030
<12-19,Howard (running down stairs with Raj)>看  传感器能用的吧
<12-19,Howard (running down stairs with Raj)>Told you the sensor would work.

328
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,680
<12-21,Penny>你成心让我在这陪着谢尔顿活受罪
<12-21,Penny>You deliberately stuck me with sheldon.

329
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,830
<12-22,Leonard>没办法  我也是不得以啊  你也看到谢尔顿什么样了
<12-22,Leonard>Come on, I had to. you see what he's like?

330
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,130
<12-23,Sheldon (off)>潘妮  我饿了
<12-23,Sheldon (off)>Penny, I'm hungry.

<12-31,Sheldon>你觉得潘妮会过来照顾咱们吗
<12-31,Sheldon>Do you think penny will come here and take care of us?

337
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,320
<12-32,Leonard>我觉得潘妮再也不会到这来了
<12-32,Leonard>I don't think penny's ever coming here again.

338

<12-33,Sheldon>我鼻塞得厉害
<12-33,Sheldon>I'm very congested.
