1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,350
<1-1,Sheldon>莱纳德  我不得不承认
<1-1,Sheldon>Well, I must say, Leonard,

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,310
<1-1,Sheldon>你一开始提出巨型层层叠的主意时
<1-1,Sheldon>when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,360
<1-1,Sheldon>我是持怀疑态度的
<1-1,Sheldon>I was skeptical.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,610
<1-2,Leonard>这不能怪你
<1-2,Leonard>I can't blame you--

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,330
<1-2,Leonard>上次的迷你版扭扭乐就烂爆了
<1-2,Leonard>Tiny Twister was a complete bust.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,780
<1-3,Sheldon>但我这次错了
<1-3,Sheldon>No, I was wrong.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,940
<1-3,Sheldon>顶着可能会
<1-3,Sheldon>The looming threat of

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,640
<1-3,Sheldon>被一堆木头压死的风险玩
<1-3,Sheldon>being crushed under a pile of lumber

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,350
<1-3,Sheldon>让游戏带感了不少
<1-3,Sheldon>does add a certain spice.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,020
<1-3,Sheldon>连人都精神起来了
<1-3,Sheldon>I've never felt so alive.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,060
<1-3,Sheldon>你好啊  艾利克斯
<1-3,Sheldon>Oh, hello, Alex.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,370
<1-3,Sheldon>我去拿昨晚的录音给你
<1-3,Sheldon>Uh, let me go get you last night's recordings.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,490
<1-4,Leonard>什么录音
<1-4,Leonard>What recordings?

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,100
<1-5,Sheldon>还记得你跟我说过  我会说梦话吗
<1-5,Sheldon>Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep?

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,800
<1-5,Sheldon>然后我想到  梦话跟我平时说的话一样
<1-5,Sheldon>Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say,

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,100
<1-5,Sheldon>含金量也应该超高的吧
<1-5,Sheldon>it's probably pure gold.

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,470
<1-5,Sheldon>所以我开始录音
<1-5,Sheldon>So I started recording it all,

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,940
<1-5,Sheldon>而现在艾利克斯得好好梳理下
<1-5,Sheldon>and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,230
<1-5,Sheldon>我称为"谢家午夜论坛"的八小时长节目
<1-5,Sheldon>of what I like to call "Sheldon After Dark."

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,160
<1-6,Alex>-你好吗  莱纳德  -好啊
<1-6,Alex>- Hey, Leonard. - Hey.

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,860
<1-7,Leonard>我在玩巨型层层叠呢
<1-7,Leonard>Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,110
<1-8,Alex>我知道啊  那顶安全帽就是我买的
<1-8,Alex>Oh, I know-- I'm the one who had to buy him the helmet.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,650
<1-8,Alex>这周末你有什么安排吗
<1-8,Alex>So, do you have any plans this weekend?

24
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,840
<1-9,Leonard>周六估计大多数时间得花在思考
<1-9,Leonard>Well, most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,490
<1-9,Leonard>这玩具玩完后收哪里
<1-9,Leonard>where to put this game when we're done.

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,310
<1-9,Leonard>你呢
<1-9,Leonard>How about you?

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,600
<1-10,Alex>我要去听基普·索恩博士的

<1-11,Leonard>他会讲述对约翰·惠勒的量子泡沫看法
<1-11,Leonard>That's his take on John Wheeler's quantum foam.

32
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,050
<1-11,Leonard>应该会很精彩
<1-11,Leonard>That should be great.

33
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,890
<1-12,Alex>有兴趣可以跟我一起去啊
<1-12,Alex>Well, if you want, you can come with me.

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,500
<1-13,Leonard>我也想啊  可是我跟佩妮有约了
<1-13,Leonard>Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny.

35
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,620
<1-14,Alex>带上她嘛
<1-14,Alex>Well, bring her.

36
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,140
<1-15,Leonard>她对这类事情没什么兴趣
<1-15,Leonard>Well, she's not really into that kind of stuff.

37
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,640
<1-16,Alex>那好吧
<1-16,Alex>Yeah, okay.

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,100
<1-16,Alex>那之后你对讲座内容有兴趣
<1-16,Alex>Well, if you want to hear about the lecture,

39

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,220
<2-11,Howard>在尿布里拉屎时就这眼神
<2-11,Howard>when he's dropping one in his diaper.

00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,830
<2-12,Leonard>她都知道我有女朋友了

<2-14,Leonard>我当然是不可能会对她下手啦  我爱佩妮
<2-14,Leonard>I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny.

70
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,700
<2-14,Leonard>只是有个年轻貌美的女性
<2-14,Leonard>It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman

71
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,400
<2-14,Leonard>对我有意思也很不错嘛
<2-14,Leonard>sniffing around the goods.

72
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,880
<2-15,Raj>我又恨你  又想当你
<2-15,Raj>I both hate you and want to be you.

<2-16,Sheldon>各位同志
<2-16,Sheldon>Aw, gentlemen.

76
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,380
<2-16,Sheldon>今早的聊天话题选项有什么呢
<2-16,Sheldon>What is on the conversational menu this morning?

77
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,170
<2-17,Raj>莱纳德抢了我的妞  他明明知道
<2-17,Raj>Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well

78
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,270
<2-17,Raj>我只差六到八个月就要对她展开攻势了
<2-17,Raj>I was only six to eight months away from making my move.

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,010
<2-18,Leonard>我才没抢走谁呢
<2-18,Leonard>I didn't steal anyone.

80
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,890
<2-19,Raj>你的助理明摆着对他有意思
<2-19,Raj>Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk

81
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,180
<2-19,Raj>他还暗爽
<2-19,Raj>and he loves it.

82
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,560
<2-20,Sheldon>这样可不行
<2-20,Sheldon>Well, that's not acceptable.

83
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,130
<2-20,Sheldon>我是她的老板
<2-20,Sheldon>I'm her boss.

84
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,430
<2-20,Sheldon>她只能关注以及满足我的需求
<2-20,Sheldon>She needs to be solely focused on my needs,

85
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,480
<2-20,Sheldon>不该被你苍白无力
<2-20,Sheldon>not distracted by your pasty,

86
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,120
<2-20,Sheldon>雌雄难辨的弱鸡阳气吸引
<2-20,Sheldon>androgynous brand of sexuality.

87
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,660
<2-21,Leonard>我怎么雌雄难辨了
<2-21,Leonard>I'm androgynous?

88
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,140
<2-22,Sheldon>拜托哦  你也不看看
<2-22,Sheldon>Oh, please. Look at you

89
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,690
<2-22,Sheldon>你那爱撅起的腊肠嘴
<2-22,Sheldon>with your pouty bee-stung lips.

90
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,580
<2-23,Leonard>你们觉得我该怎么回应她
<2-23,Leonard>What do you guys think I should do?

91
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,430
<2-24,Raj>我觉得你应该告诉她  你只爱佩妮
<2-24,Raj>I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny,

92
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,090
<2-24,Raj>然后我借肩膀给她哭诉
<2-24,Raj>I provide her a shoulder to cry on,

93
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,970
<2-24,Raj>然后差不多半年后  我就能给她"来一发"了
<2-24,Raj>and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.

94
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,460
<3-1,Sheldon>我要感谢你们能这么快就赶过来
<3-1,Sheldon>I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice.

<3-1,Sheldon>to each of you individually,

97
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,220

<3-1,Sheldon>but I believe my present situation

98
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,220
<3-1,Sheldon>需要你们一起共同集思广益
<3-1,Sheldon>requires the collective wisdom of the group,

99
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,510
<3-1,Sheldon>想必你们从纪念T恤上也能看得出
<3-1,Sheldon>which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts

100
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,340
<3-1,Sheldon>我标注上了

<3-13,Sheldon>其实我要说的重点不是里卡多和唐德莱娅
<3-13,Sheldon>Okay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya.

122
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,300
<3-13,Sheldon>而是唐德莱娅的博士老板
<3-13,Sheldon>It is really about her boss,

123
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,770
<3-13,Sheldon>他不知道该如何处理这种情况
<3-13,Sheldon>who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation

124
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,440
<3-13,Sheldon>所以需要你们给出主意
<3-13,Sheldon>and could use your advice,

125
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,070
<3-13,Sheldon>这有些反常  因为爱因斯坦·冯·集思广益博士
<3-13,Sheldon>which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm...

126
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,650
<3-13,Sheldon>向来很会处理这种情况
<3-13,Sheldon>He's usually pretty smart about these things.

127
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,100
<3-14,Penny>我要杀了她
<3-14,Penny>I'm gonna kill her.

128
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,400
<3-15,Bernadette>我相信你没什么好担心的
<3-15,Bernadette>I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about.

129
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,140
<3-15,Bernadette>莱纳德绝对不会背叛你
<3-15,Bernadette>Leonard would never cheat on you.

130
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,250
<3-15,Bernadette>她说得对
<3-15,Bernadette>She's right.

131
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,810
<3-16,Amy>但只要你开口  我有满满
<3-16,Amy>But say the word-- I got a lab

132
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,290
<3-16,Amy>一实验室不怕死的毒瘾疯猴  随时听候差遣
<3-16,Amy>full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose.

133
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,950
<3-16,Amy>可以扔一个进她的汽车后座
<3-16,Amy>One of them could end up in the backseat of her car.

134
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,560
<3-16,Amy>或是她的浴室
<3-16,Amy>Or her shower.

135
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,190
<3-17,Sheldon>女士们  女士们  拜托
<3-17,Sheldon>Ladies, ladies, please.

136
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,070
<3-17,Sheldon>我们不是来这里讨论佩妮的  好吗
<3-17,Sheldon>We're not here to talk about Penny, okay?

137
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,500
<3-17,Sheldon>我们是来讨论我的
<3-17,Sheldon>We're here to talk about me.

138
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,860
<3-17,Sheldon>我是说爱因斯坦·冯·集思...  我靠
<3-17,Sheldon>Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainst... Oh, darn it!

139
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,450
<3-17,Sheldon>好吧  说溜嘴了
<3-17,Sheldon>All right, I guess the cat's out of the bag.

140
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,100
<3-17,Sheldon>那我就来解释下发生了什么事吧
<3-17,Sheldon>Let me explain what's going on--

141
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,580
<3-17,Sheldon>里卡多其实是莱纳德...
<3-17,Sheldon>Ricardo is really Leonard...

142
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,020
<3-18,Penny>我们知道发生了什么事  谢尔顿
<3-18,Penny>We know what's going on, Sheldon!

143
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,650
<3-19,Sheldon>那我应该怎么做
<3-19,Sheldon>Well, what should I do?

144
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,520
<3-20,Bernadette>艾利克斯是你的员工
<3-20,Bernadette>Well, Alex is your employee.

145
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,910
<3-20,Bernadette>如果她做出一些让莱纳德觉得不舒服的事
<3-20,Bernadette>If she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable,

146
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,470
<3-20,Bernadette>那你应该跟她谈谈
<3-20,Bernadette>you should talk to her.

147
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,030
<3-21,Sheldon>不  他才没有不舒服呢
<3-21,Sheldon>Oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all.

148
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,340
<3-22,Penny>他暗爽死了好吗
<3-22,Penny>No, he's loving it.

149
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,950
<3-21,Sheldon>对啊  他趾高气昂地好像自己有两米那么高
<3-21,Sheldon>Yeah, he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six.

150
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,170
<3-22,Penny>什么  他很暗爽
<3-22,Penny>What... He's loving it?

151
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,330
<3-23,Bernadette>谢尔顿  你得马上跟艾利克斯谈谈
<3-23,Bernadette>Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.

152
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,450
<3-23,Bernadette>谈谈  就只有这种建议啊
<3-23,Bernadette>Talk to her? That's all you've got?

153
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,370
<3-24,Sheldon>"谢尔顿·库伯姐妹顾问团"的名字这么牛气
<3-24,Sheldon>With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies,

154
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,250
<3-24,Sheldon>我本来期望很高呢
<3-24,Sheldon>I really expected more.

155
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,610
<3-24,Sheldon>把T恤还我
<3-24,Sheldon>Give me back the T-shirts.

156
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,650
<3-24,Sheldon>艾利克斯
<3-24,Sheldon>Alex...

157
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,900
<4-1,Sheldon>查下我的日程表
<4-1,Sheldon>check my schedule.

158
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,960
<4-1,Sheldon>今天下午我有什么安排
<4-1,Sheldon>What does my afternoon look like?

159
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,650
<4-2,Alex>我记得好像没有任何安排
<4-2,Alex>I think it's pretty wide open.

160
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,550
<4-2,Alex>慢着  四点有安排
<4-2,Alex>Oh, wait. Here's something at 4:00.

161
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,390
<4-2,Alex>"跟艾利克斯谈谈"
<4-2,Alex>"Give Alex a talking to"?

162
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,910
<4-3,Sheldon>这安排真是悄无声息出人意料啊
<4-3,Sheldon>Well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?

163
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,050
<4-4,Alex>有什么问题吗
<4-4,Alex>Is there a problem?

164
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,190
<4-5,Sheldon>那其实不叫问题
<4-5,Sheldon>Let's not call it a problem.

165
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,380
<4-5,Sheldon>我们应该称其为"机会"
<4-5,Sheldon>Let's call it an opportunity.

166
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,060
<4-5,Sheldon>一个解决严重问题的机会
<4-5,Sheldon>To solve a serious problem.

167
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,600
<4-6,Alex>我做错什么了
<4-6,Alex>What did I do?

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,300
<4-7,Sheldon>你不知道吗  可怜的小宝贝
<4-7,Sheldon>You don't know? Oh, you poor dear.

169
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,630
<4-7,Sheldon>你的卵巢把太多愚蠢分泌物
<4-7,Sheldon>Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice

170
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,150
<4-7,Sheldon>都送到你脑子  害你人都傻了
<4-7,Sheldon>into your brains you don't even know which way is up.

171
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,950
<4-7,Sheldon>你对霍夫斯塔德博士做出
<4-7,Sheldon>You made an inappropriate sexual advance

172
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,470
<4-7,Sheldon>-不恰当的性企图  -什么
<4-7,Sheldon>- towards Dr. Hofstadter. - What?

173
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,430
<4-8,Alex>我没有对任何人做任何性企图
<4-8,Alex>I didn't make a sexual advance on anybody.

174
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,740
<4-9,Sheldon>别这么快就开始激动辩解
<4-9,Sheldon>Now, there's no need to get defensive.

175
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,260
<4-9,Sheldon>我对你的情况表示同情
<4-9,Sheldon>I'm not unsympathetic to your plight.

176
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,490
<4-9,Sheldon>我的父亲过去常说  女人就像
<4-9,Sheldon>My father used to say that a woman

177
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,400
<4-9,Sheldon>德州温暖天气中的鸡蛋沙拉三明治
<4-9,Sheldon>is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.

178
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,430
<4-10,Alex>什么意思
<4-10,Alex>What?

179
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,860
<4-11,Sheldon>鸡蛋[卵子]满满  诱惑短短[容易坏]
<4-11,Sheldon>Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.

180
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,560
<4-12,Alex>这次谈话让我觉得很不舒服
<4-12,Alex>This conversation is making me uncomfortable.

181
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,180
<4-13,Sheldon>不止你  我也是  妹妹
<4-13,Sheldon>Yeah, you and me both, sister.

182
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,310
<4-13,Sheldon>现在
<4-13,Sheldon>Now,

183
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,320
<4-13,Sheldon>请你明白
<4-13,Sheldon>please understand...

184
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,880
<4-13,Sheldon>你的行为  我并不觉得是你的错
<4-13,Sheldon>I don't hold you responsible for your behavior

185
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,050
<4-13,Sheldon>因为从进化的角度看
<4-13,Sheldon>because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint,

186
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,970
<4-13,Sheldon>你不过是自身繁殖欲望的奴隶
<4-13,Sheldon>you're a slave to your desire to reproduce.

187
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,760
<4-13,Sheldon>但在工作时间
<4-13,Sheldon>But during the work day,

188
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,050
<4-13,Sheldon>当你觉得自己有求欢的意图时
<4-13,Sheldon>when you feel possessed by amorous intent,

189
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,100
<4-13,Sheldon>我能否建议你
<4-13,Sheldon>may I suggest that you suppress it

190
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,950
<4-13,Sheldon>通过翻阅这本性传播疾病的绘本
<4-13,Sheldon>by leafing through this illustrated book

191
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,340
<4-13,Sheldon>来抑制住你的欲望
<4-13,Sheldon>of sexually transmitted diseases?

192
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,750
<4-13,Sheldon>我们看一下  就这页
<4-13,Sheldon>Let's see here. Oh, yes.

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,000
<4-13,Sheldon>你看看这张小恶心图片
<4-13,Sheldon>Check out this oozy doozy.

194
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,790
<4-14,Alex>我要走了
<4-14,Alex>I have to go.

195
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,130
<4-15,Sheldon>这位仁兄也是
<4-15,Sheldon>So does this fellow,

196
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,010
<4-15,Sheldon>但他走不了  他那里就跟热汤那样烧得慌
<4-15,Sheldon>but he can't without it burning like hot soup.

197
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,090
<5-1,Leonard>嗨  美女
<5-1,Leonard>Hey, pretty lady.

198
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,010
<5-2,Penny>你看起来格外开心啊
<5-2,Penny>Oh, you seem extra happy.

199
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,010
<5-3,Leonard>应该是吧
<5-3,Leonard>Uh, I guess I am.

200
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,680
<5-4,Penny>有什么特别的原因吗
<5-4,Penny>Any particular reason why?

201
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,760
<5-5,Leonard>不知道  就是今天过得还不错
<5-5,Leonard>Mm, I don't know, just having a good day.

202
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,830
<5-5,Leonard>早上谢尔顿在去上班的路上睡着了
<5-5,Leonard>This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work,

203
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,800
<5-5,Leonard>所以我有机会听广播
<5-5,Leonard>so I got to listen to the radio--

204
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,260
<5-5,Leonard>好疯狂的一早
<5-5,Leonard>that was pretty crazy.

205
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,150
<5-6,Penny>还有别的吗
<5-6,Penny>Anything else?

206
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,180
<5-7,Leonard>我在网上发现一个小测试
<5-7,Leonard>I found this quiz online called

207
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,610
<5-7,Leonard>名叫"测测你是星际迷航中的谁"
<5-7,Leonard>"Which Star Trek Character Are You?"

208
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,910
<5-7,Leonard>我测了四次  终于测到柯克船长[角色]
<5-7,Leonard>and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.

209
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,410
<5-8,Penny>很好啊
<5-8,Penny>That's great.

210
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,390
<5-9,Leonard>的确如此
<5-9,Leonard>Oh. It. Was.

211
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,420
<5-10,Penny>很高兴你今天过得这么开心
<5-10,Penny>Well, I'm glad you're having such a great day.

212
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,820
<5-11,Leonard>还有一件让我更开心的事就是
<5-11,Leonard>And the one thing that could make it even better

213
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,990
<5-11,Leonard>晚上要跟我特别的姑娘约会
<5-11,Leonard>is an evening with my special girl.

214
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,160
<5-12,Penny>哪一个啊
<5-12,Penny>Oh, and who's that?

215
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,830
<5-13,Leonard>这话什么意思
<5-13,Leonard>What do you mean?

216
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,460
<5-14,Penny>我不知道特别的姑娘  是指我还是艾利克斯
<5-14,Penny>Oh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex.

217
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,520
<5-15,Leonard>为什么会指艾利克斯
<5-15,Leonard>Um, why would I mean Alex?

218
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,730
<5-16,Penny>因为我知道她对你有意思
<5-16,Penny>Because I know she hit on you

219
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,860
<5-16,Penny>而且我还知道你很暗爽
<5-16,Penny>and I know you liked it!

220
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,920
<5-17,Leonard>哪里...有
<5-17,Leonard>What...?

221
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,880
<5-18,Penny>别跟老娘装傻  里卡多·谢利沙力
<5-18,Penny>Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!

222
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,030
<5-19,Leonard>我是不是漏了什么事
<5-19,Leonard>I'm missing something.

223
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,320
<5-19,Leonard>你是不是跟佩妮说了艾利克斯的事
<5-19,Leonard>Did you say something to Penny about Alex?

224
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,160
<5-20,Sheldon>没错  而且还得到了"很多帮助"呢
<5-20,Sheldon>Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me.

225
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,970
<5-20,Sheldon>"帮助"就是她光顾着生你的气了
<5-20,Sheldon>All she did was get mad at you.

226
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,840
<5-21,Leonard>你为什么要这样做
<5-21,Leonard>Why would you do that?

227
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,950
<5-22,Sheldon>我需要关于女人的建议
<5-22,Sheldon>I needed advice about a woman.

228
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,130
<5-22,Sheldon>我本来可以问你的
<5-22,Sheldon>I would have asked you,

229
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,420
<5-22,Sheldon>但要说过去几年证明了什么
<5-22,Sheldon>but if the last few years have proven anything,

230
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,090
<5-22,Sheldon>那就是你连子宫和独轮车都分不清
<5-22,Sheldon>it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.

231
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,460
<5-23,Leonard>至少我知道随便对女生透露
<5-23,Leonard>At least I know not to blab to a girl

232
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,870
<5-23,Leonard>有人追她男友是不对的
<5-23,Leonard>about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.

233
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,530
<5-24,Sheldon>知道这个太好了
<5-24,Sheldon>Good to know.

234
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,080
<5-24,Sheldon>你再多说点这类的金玉良言
<5-24,Sheldon>Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that,

235
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,920
<5-24,Sheldon>就可以名正言顺地加入姐妹顾问团了
<5-24,Sheldon>you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.

236
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,560
<5-24,Sheldon>你好
<5-24,Sheldon>Hello.

237

256
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,310
<6-7,Sheldon>但我不明白她有什么可抱怨的
<6-7,Sheldon>But I can't understand what she has to complain about.

257

<6-7,Sheldon>她处在见证我改写科学界历史的最前线
<6-7,Sheldon>I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history.

<6-7,Sheldon>我向她展示染上妇科病的生殖器图片
<6-7,Sheldon>I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity

262
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,590
<6-7,Sheldon>指引她走出了淫乱的歧途
<6-7,Sheldon>by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.

263
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,970
<6-8,HR Woman>取消下一位的面谈
<6-8,HR Woman>Cancel my next appointment.

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,070
<6-8,HR Woman>这位估计得耗点时间
<6-8,HR Woman>This is gonna take a while.

265
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,350
<6-8,HR Woman>库珀博士
<6-8,HR Woman>Dr. Cooper,

266
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,920
<6-8,HR Woman>你对你的下属
<6-8,HR Woman>you said things to your employee

267
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,580
<6-8,HR Woman>说了在职场上不应该说的话
<6-8,HR Woman>that you just cannot say in the workplace.

268
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,220
<6-9,Sheldon>比如什么
<6-9,Sheldon>Like what?

269
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,850
<6-10,HR Woman>据詹森女士说
<6-10,HR Woman>Well, according to Ms. Jensen,

270
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,430
<6-10,HR Woman>你说她是自己生理需求的奴隶
<6-10,HR Woman>you said that she was a slave to her biological urges

271
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,590
<6-10,HR Woman>并且称呼她为"鸡蛋沙拉三明治"
<6-10,HR Woman>and called her an "egg salad sandwich."

272
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,760
<6-10,HR Woman>虽然我不知道那是什么比喻
<6-10,HR Woman>I don't even know what that means,

273
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,080
<6-10,HR Woman>但我告诉你  说那种话是不行的
<6-10,HR Woman>but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.

274
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,980
<6-11,Sheldon>我明白怎么会有误会了
<6-11,Sheldon>Oh! I see the confusion here.

275
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,510
<6-11,Sheldon>艾利克斯以为我在针对她  不是这样的
<6-11,Sheldon>No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No.

276
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,730
<6-11,Sheldon>我的意思是所有女人
<6-11,Sheldon>I meant that all women

277
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,530
<6-11,Sheldon>都是自己生理需求的奴隶
<6-11,Sheldon>are slaves to their biological urges, you know?

278
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,300
<6-11,Sheldon>你也一样
<6-11,Sheldon>Even you.

279
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,160
<6-11,Sheldon>你是个奴隶
<6-11,Sheldon>You're a slave.

280
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,130
<6-12,HR Woman>我是什么来着
<6-12,HR Woman>I'm a what?

281
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,670
<6-13,Sheldon>我的意思是
<6-13,Sheldon>Well, y-you... I-I'm just saying, you know,

282
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,670
<6-13,Sheldon>在女性生理周期的某一时刻
<6-13,Sheldon>at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle...

283
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,060
<6-14,HR Woman>停停停
<6-14,HR Woman>Whuh-ah!

284
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,030
<6-14,HR Woman>这也是你不能谈论的  库珀博士
<6-14,HR Woman>You can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper.

285
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,260
<6-14,HR Woman>你的语言非常不恰当
<6-14,HR Woman>Your language is entirely inappropriate,

286
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,920
<6-14,HR Woman>我建议立刻给我闭嘴
<6-14,HR Woman>and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.

287
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,940
<6-15,Sheldon>我真不明白被指责的怎么会是我
<6-15,Sheldon>I d... I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here.

288
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,860
<6-15,Sheldon>霍夫斯塔德博士  每抓到一个听众
<6-15,Sheldon>Dr. Hofstadter-- he was bragging about

289
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,620
<6-15,Sheldon>他就要炫耀自己有多风靡女性万千
<6-15,Sheldon>his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen.

<7-5,Leonard>Of course not. No. Why?

317
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,130
<7-6,Penny>因为她又漂亮又聪明
<7-6,Penny>Because...she is pretty and smart,

318
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,980
<7-6,Penny>你们要是谈论工作的东西  她不必跑回家
<7-6,Penny>and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home

319
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,990
<7-6,Penny>翻翻字典才能理解你在说什么

323
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,230
<7-9,Leonard>要是你把这个活抢走了
<7-9,Leonard>and if you take it away,

324
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,500
<7-9,Leonard>那我们的关系之中  我就贡献不出东西了
<7-9,Leonard>I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,580
<7-13,Leonard>我从没想过你会有这种感觉
<7-13,Leonard>I just never think of you having feelings like that.

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,430
<7-14,Penny>-我有的  -为什么呢
<7-14,Penny>- Well, I do. - Why?

331
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,790
<7-15,Leonard>我和艾利克斯绝对没可能
<7-15,Leonard>Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.

356
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,340
<10-1,Howard>你真觉得现在是喝酒的好时机吗
<10-1,Howard>Do you really think you should be drinking right now?

357
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,920
<10-2,Raj>不然我等会怎么回答人事部小姐的问题
<10-2,Raj>How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?

358
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,930
<10-3,Howard>不知道  看心理医生怎么样
<10-3,Howard>I don't know. Seek professional help?

360
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,660
<10-4,Raj>我有啊  酒类专卖店的人说
<10-4,Raj>I did. The guy at the liquor store said

361
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,300
<10-4,Raj>这玩意配咖啡口感不错
<10-4,Raj>this stuff tastes great in coffee.

362
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,020
<10-5,Howard>等下  你也被召来了吗
<10-5,Howard>Wait, you got called in, too?

363
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,250
<10-5,Howard>出什么事了
<10-5,Howard>What is going on?

364
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,280
<10-6,Leonard>谢尔顿把我们都拉来陪葬了
<10-6,Leonard>Sheldon threw us all under the bus.

365
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
<10-8,Raj>我感觉自己像是见校长的坏学生
<10-8,Raj>I feel like I've been called down to the principal's office.

366
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,390
<10-8,Raj>不过我可不介意被"棕糖美妞"打屁屁
<10-8,Raj>Although I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me.

367
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,840
<10-8,Raj>还是在性爱秋千上打哦
<10-8,Raj>From a sex swing!

368
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,670
<10-8,Raj>喝酒可能是个错误决定
<10-8,Raj>This may have been a mistake.

369
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,660
<10-9,Howard>放轻松  没事的
<10-9,Howard>Relax. Everything's gonna be fine.

370
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,940
<10-9,Howard>要知道在我碰到伯纳黛特前
<10-9,Howard>You know, before I met Bernadette

371
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,660
<10-9,Howard>我是这里三天两头报到的常客
<10-9,Howard>I was in here every other day.

372
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,000
<10-9,Howard>友情提示下
<10-9,Howard>Uh, little tip:

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,680
<10-9,Howard>进去前先把"我喜欢大屁妞"的铃声调成静音
<10-9,Howard>turn off your "I Like Big Butts" ringtone before you go in.

374
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,310
<10-10,Raj>这都是你的错
<10-10,Raj>Well, this is all your fault.

375
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,690
<10-11,Leonard>怎么成我的错了
<10-11,Leonard>How is this my fault?

376
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,970
<10-12,Raj>如果你没和谢尔顿的助理鬼混
<10-12,Raj>If you weren't screwing around with Sheldon's assistant,

377
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,010
<10-12,Raj>根本不会发生现在这种破事
<10-12,Raj>none of this would be happening.

378
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,760
<10-13,Leonard>我才没跟任何人鬼混
<10-13,Leonard>I wasn't screwing around with anyone.

379
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,930
<10-13,Leonard>是哦  没有
<10-13,Leonard>Oh, of course not.

380
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,580
<10-14,Raj>那你是想说  她在"闻你的货时"
<10-14,Raj>She was just sniffing around your goods

382
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,880
<10-14,Raj>只是单纯在找松露而已吗[靠猪的嗅觉找]
<10-14,Raj>because she was hunting for truffles.

383
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,050
<10-15,HR Woman>沃罗威茨先生  好久不见
<10-15,HR Woman>Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it's been a while.

384
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,640
<10-16,Howard>你好  洁宁
<10-16,Howard>Hey, Janine.

385
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,990
<10-16,Howard>汤姆和孩子们好吗
<10-16,Howard>How are Tom and the kids?

386
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,410
<10-16,Howard>很好
<10-16,Howard>Fine.

387
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,130
<10-17,Janine>你一定是霍夫斯塔德博士吧
<10-17,Janine>You must be Dr. Hofstadter.

388
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,860
<10-18,Leonard>是  但我想这是个天大的误会
<10-18,Leonard>Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.

389
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,650
<10-19,Raj>你也误会我了
<10-19,Raj>Yeah, yeah, me, too.

390
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,580
<10-19,Raj>我什么都没干
<10-19,Raj>I didn't do anything.

391
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,230
<10-20,Janine>你怎么说话满嘴酒气
<10-20,Janine>Is that alcohol on your breath?

392
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,410
<10-21,Raj>霍华德造了个性爱机器人
<10-21,Raj>Howard built a sex robot.

393
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,370
<10-22,Howard>没有这回事
<10-22,Howard>That is not true.

394
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,230
<10-22,Howard>我就只是造了个机器人而已
<10-22,Howard>All I did was build a robot.

395
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,310
<10-23,Janine>你那个机器人有六个胸吗
<10-23,Janine>Did it have six breasts?

396
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,710
<10-24,Howard>抱歉  我是个尊重男女平等的人
<10-24,Howard>I'm sorry, I'm a feminist--

397
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,110
<10-24,Howard>我不会特别注意
<10-24,Howard>I don't notice things like

398
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,960
<10-24,Howard>机器人有多少乳房这种事
<10-24,Howard>how many breasts a robot has.

399
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,610
<10-25,Sheldon>大家好
<10-25,Sheldon>Well, hello.

400
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,900
<10-26,Leonard>你来干嘛
<10-26,Leonard>What are you doing here?

401
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,950
<10-27,Sheldon>我是来找戴维斯夫人的
<10-27,Sheldon>Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.

402
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,350
<10-28,Janine>我现在有点忙
<10-28,Janine>And I'm a little busy right now.

403
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,900
<10-29,Sheldon>我是来投诉的
<10-29,Sheldon>But I came to file a complaint.

404
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,370
<10-29,Sheldon>有人在工作场所通过用不当的
<10-29,Sheldon>Yeah, somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace

405
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,460
<10-29,Sheldon>和带性字眼的言语骚扰我  让我觉得不适
<10-29,Sheldon>by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.

406
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,680
<10-30,Janine>是谁呢
<10-30,Janine>And who was that?

407
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,750
<10-31,Sheldon>就你啊  你这色色的婆娘
<10-31,Sheldon>You, you dirty birdie.

408
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,970
<10-31,Sheldon>我回想了下你昨天跟我说过的话
<10-31,Sheldon>I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday,

409
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,340
<10-31,Sheldon>我意识到那是对我深深的冒犯
<10-31,Sheldon>and I realized I'm deeply offended.

410
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,250
<10-31,Sheldon>现在乖乖去给本大爷拿投诉表来
<10-31,Sheldon>Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.

411
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:39,960
<10-31,Sheldon>够了
<10-31,Sheldon>That's it.

412
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,390
<10-32,Janine>所有人  马上进我办公室
<10-32,Janine>All of you, in my office now!

413
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,860
<10-33,Sheldon>多亏你的"教导"  我不至于傻到问
<10-33,Sheldon>And thanks to you, I know better than to ask

414
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,040
<10-33,Sheldon>你是不是来"大姨妈"了
<10-33,Sheldon>if you're menstruating.

415
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,440
<10-33,Sheldon>而看你这狂躁样  不问也知道
<10-33,Sheldon>And based on your behavior, I don't have to.

416
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,190
<11-1,Sheldon>经过训示后  我才明白
<11-1,Sheldon>It has been pointed out to me that...

417
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,080
<11-1,Sheldon>我对你说的某些话
<11-1,Sheldon>some of the things I said to you

418
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,040
<11-1,Sheldon>可能会被理解成  无礼
<11-1,Sheldon>could be construed as... offensive,

419
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,730
<11-1,Sheldon>我愿意向你表达
<11-1,Sheldon>and I would like to offer you

420
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,710
<11-1,Sheldon>我最真诚的歉意
<11-1,Sheldon>my sincerest apology.

421
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,190
<11-2,Alex>-谢谢  库珀博士  -另外
<11-2,Alex>- Thank you, Dr. Cooper. - Yeah, additionally,

422
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,040
<11-3,Sheldon>跟你说下  校方要求我
<11-3,Sheldon>you should know that the university has mandated

423
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,290
<11-3,Sheldon>参加在线性骚扰研讨班
<11-3,Sheldon>that I take an online sexual harassment seminar

424
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,380
<11-3,Sheldon>这样以后不会再发生类似的事情
<11-3,Sheldon>so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.

425
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,740
<11-5,Sheldon>-好的  -现在
<11-5,Sheldon>- Okay. - Yeah. Now,

426
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,950
<11-5,Sheldon>遗憾的是  我的时间太过宝贵
<11-5,Sheldon>unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable

427
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,430
<11-5,Sheldon>不能浪费在这种屁事上面
<11-5,Sheldon>to waste on nonsense like this,

428
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,930
<11-5,Sheldon>所以  我需要你替我考过这个测试
<11-5,Sheldon>so... um, I'm gonna need you to take it for me.

429
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,160
<11-5,Sheldon>还有  你最好给我得个A
<11-5,Sheldon>Oh, and, uh, you'd better ace it--

430
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,920
<11-5,Sheldon>因为校方还挺生气的
<11-5,Sheldon>they're pretty mad.

431
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,560
<12-1,Penny>我一直在想你和艾利克斯的事
<12-1,Penny>So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.

432
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,440
<12-2,Leonard>拜托你别再为这个烦心了
<12-2,Leonard>Oh, would you stop worrying about that?

433
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,280
<12-3,Penny>我也没办法  但我想着
<12-3,Penny>I can't help it. But, look, I figured

434
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,880
<12-3,Penny>我可以不作为  一直觉得没安全感
<12-3,Penny>I could sit around and feel insecure,

435
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,630
<12-3,Penny>或者也可以做出行动
<12-3,Penny>or I could do something about it.

436
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,430
<12-3,Penny>所以我拿了学校的课程表
<12-3,Penny>So I got a course catalog at school

437
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,970
<12-3,Penny>看下了科学类课程
<12-3,Penny>and looked at some of the science classes.

438
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,740
<12-4,Leonard>太好了
<12-4,Leonard>That's great.

439
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,720
<12-5,Penny>一点也不好  那些课都闷死了
<12-5,Penny>No, it isn't-- they are extremely boring.

440
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,310
<12-5,Penny>你怎么撑到现在还没有自杀
<12-5,Penny>I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day?

441
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,530
<12-5,Penny>话说回来  我觉得我没必要做科学家
<12-5,Penny>Anyway, I decided I don't need to be a scientist,

442
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,980
<12-5,Penny>我只要看起来像就行
<12-5,Penny>I could just look like one.

443
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,510
<12-5,Penny>所以我买了这个
<12-5,Penny>So I bought these.

444
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,050
<12-5,Penny>眼镜
<12-5,Penny>Glasses?

445
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,520
<12-6,Leonard>我不觉得这会有什么帮助...
<12-6,Leonard>I really don't think that's gonna change--

446
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,240
<12-6,Leonard>我的天啊
<12-6,Leonard>oh, my God,

447
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,880
<12-6,Leonard>你看起来真是聪明绝顶兼性感撩人
<12-6,Leonard>you look so smart and hot!

448
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,610
<12-7,Penny>我知道  瞧好啦
<12-7,Penny>I know, right? Watch this.

449
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,970
<12-7,Penny>分子
<12-7,Penny>Molecules.

450
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,390
<12-8,Leonard>跟我来吧
<12-8,Leonard>Okay, come with me.

451
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,410
<12-9,Penny>-去哪里  -我的卧室
<12-9,Penny>- Where are we going? - To my bedroom,

452
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,060
<12-10,Leonard>这样我可以扒光你除了眼镜外的一切衣物
<12-10,Leonard>so I can take everything off but those glasses...

453
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,400
<12-10,Leonard>靴子也留着好了
<12-10,Leonard>and maybe the boots.
