<1-3,Howard>彻底毁灭 只需短短4.8秒
<1-3,Howard>from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,600
<1-4,Sheldon>如果说我爱我们的机器人杀手 是不是大罪过?
<1-4,Sheldon>Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,990
<1-5,Raj>跟对我爸爸一样 我既爱它又怕它
<1-5,Raj>As with my father,I both love and fear it.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,180
<1-6,Howard>好了 废话少说 我们来搞点破坏
<1-6,Howard>All right,enough chitchat. Let's destroy something.

<1-7,Together (lifting)>Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,420
<1-8,Raj>也许我们该从小的东西开始
<1-8,Raj>*************

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,200
<1-8,Raj>好吧 也许今天我们最终可以搞清楚 这个魔法球里有什么了
<1-8,Raj>**************

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,480
<1-11,Sheldon>我四岁时就做过了
<1-11,Sheldon>Did it when I was four.

<1-11,Sheldon>是个二十面体染色物在蓝水里漂浮
<1-11,Sheldon>It's an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.

16

<1-12,Raj>老兄 说之前给个"剧透"警告好吧
<1-12,Raj>Man,call "spoiler alert" before you say things like that.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,550
<1-13,Leonard>烤面包机怎么样?
<1-13,Leonard>How about the toaster oven?

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,490
<1-14,Sheldon>烤面包机咋得罪你了?
<1-14,Sheldon>What did the toaster oven ever do to you?

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,970
<1-15,Leonard>三年级时 我又咋得罪吉姆·马林斯了?
<1-15,Leonard>What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade?

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,900
<1-15,Leonard>他照样用我的拳头朝我的脸打了一拳
<1-15,Leonard>He still punched me in the face with my own fists.

21
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,720
<1-15,Leonard>抱歉 可爱的小呆子 你在错误的时间出现错误的房间
<1-15,Leonard>Sorry,you little nerd,you were just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,150
<1-17,Sheldon>这可是个历史性的时刻
<1-17,Sheldon>This is an auspicious moment.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,130
<1-17,Sheldon>就像罗伯特·奥本海默和尼尔·阿姆斯壮
<1-17,Sheldon>Like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong,

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,700
<1-17,Sheldon>我们得编句合适的台词 来纪念这个有历史意义的科学事件
<1-17,Sheldon>we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.

27
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,700
<1-18,Raj>"死吧 烤面包机 去死吧!"怎么样?
<1-18,Raj>How about "Die,toaster,die"?

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,740
<1-19,Leonard>我看行
<1-19,Leonard>That'll do it.

29
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,080
<1-20,Raj (after watching complete destruction of toaster oven)>好啦 接下来砍什么?
<1-20,Raj (after watching complete destruction of toaster oven)>All right,what's next?

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,770
<2-1,Penny>不了 我今晚要呆在家里洗衣服
<2-1,Penny>No,I think I'm just going to stay in tonight and do laundry.

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,030
<3-2,Penny>噢 耶 这门被猛械毁了
<3-2,Penny>Oh,yeah,this door got the full Monte.

32

<3-3,Leonard>莱纳德?
<3-3,Leonard>Leonard?

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,750
<3-4,Penny>怎么回事?
<3-4,Penny>What the hell?

34
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,980
<3-5,Leonard>机器人杀手 我们造的
<3-5,Leonard>Killer robot. We built it.

35
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,250
<3-6,Penny>是吗 它差点杀了我
<3-6,Penny>Yeah,well,it almost killed me.

36
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,340
<3-7,Sheldon>它要是想杀你 你早死了
<3-7,Sheldon>If it wanted to kill you,you'd be dead.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,930
<3-8,Penny>那么 它到底想杀谁?
<3-8,Penny>So,who exactly does it want to kill?

38
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:01,450
<3-9,Sheldon>抱歉 难道你不知道即将举行的 南加州机器人格斗循环邀请赛?
<3-9,Sheldon>I'm sorry,are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?

39
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,450
<3-10,Penny>知道吗 从我去年搬来以后 不是所有的邮件都被转寄掉
<3-10,Penny>You know,since I moved last year,not all my mail has been forwarded.

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,600
<3-11,Howard>这可是件大事
<3-11,Howard>It's a big deal.

41
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,370
<3-11,Howard>会有颁奖宴会还有舞会
<3-11,Howard>There's an awards banquet and a dance afterward.

42
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,740
<3-11,Howard>也许你会想跟我一起去
<3-11,Howard>Perhaps you'd like to come with me.

43
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,140
<3-11,Howard>我相信其他人看见女生 肯定会很兴奋
<3-11,Howard>I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,620
<3-12,Penny>如果就我一个女生去 怎么能叫舞会呢?
<3-12,Penny>How is it supposed to be a dance if I'm the only girl?

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,520
<3-13,Howard>好吧 也许这么说有点夸张
<3-13,Howard>Well,that may be a slight exaggeration.

46
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,130
<3-13,Howard>你是唯一可以上的女孩
<3-13,Howard>You'd be the only doable girl.

47
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,220
<3-14,Penny>你是头猪 霍华德
<3-14,Penny>You're a pig,Howard.

48
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,190
<3-15,Howard>"可以上"是在赞美你 没别的意思
<3-15,Howard>How is "doable" anything but a compliment?

49
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,800
<3-16,Leonard>霍华德 我们还是搞机器人吧
<3-16,Leonard>Howard,why don't we just work on the robot?

50
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,960
<3-17,Howard>拜托 莱纳德 现在不是时候
<3-17,Howard>Please,Leonard,not now.

51
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,960
<3-17,Howard>又一次 佩妮和我开始了 我们的双人探戈
<3-17,Howard>Once again,Penny and I have begun our little tango.

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,150
<3-18,Penny>我们的探戈?
<3-18,Penny>Our tango?

53
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,270
<3-19,Howard>肉体的博弈 性欲的推拉
<3-19,Howard>The carnal repartee,the erotic to and fro.

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,620
<3-19,Howard>尽管开胃菜很美味
<3-19,Howard>But as delicious as the appetizer might be,

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,980
<3-19,Howard>我们还是该屈从 吃下主菜 趁它还是...
<3-19,Howard>at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entr\e while it's still...

56
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,560
<3-19,Howard>热的
<3-19,Howard>hot.

57
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,980
<3-20,Leonard>求你了 不要再说了
<3-20,Leonard>I'm begging you,stop talking.

58
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,840
<3-21,Penny>听着 通常呢 我无视你就好了
<3-21,Penny>Look,normally I can just ignore you.

59
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,550
<3-21,Penny>我知道 你有点古怪
<3-21,Penny>I mean,I get it-- you're a little peculiar.

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,670
<3-21,Penny>就像谢尔顿
<3-21,Penny>You know,like Sheldon.

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,750
<3-22,Sheldon>抱歉 佩妮 但是在这间屋里 你才是古怪的那个
<3-22,Sheldon>Excuse me,Penny,but in this room,you're the one who's peculiar.

62
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,030
<3-23,Penny>嗯 也许你说的对
<3-23,Penny>Yeah,you might be right.

63
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,870
<3-23,Penny>但是回到你身上
<3-23,Penny>But back to you.

64
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,650
<3-23,Penny>我知道你认为自己是个 能言善辩的少女杀手
<3-23,Penny>I know you think you're some sort of smooth-talking ladies' man,

65
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,100
<3-23,Penny>但事实是 你很可悲又恶心
<3-23,Penny>but the truth is,you are just pathetic and creepy.

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,460
<3-24,Howard>那么 啥意思呢?
<3-24,Howard>So what are you saying?

67
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,160
<3-25,Penny>我的意思是说我是"可以上的" 根本就不是啥赞美
<3-25,Penny>I am saying it is not a compliment to call me "doable."

68
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,490
<3-25,Penny>盯着我的屁股看并说 "喔~ 这肯定是果冻"
<3-25,Penny>It's not sexy to stare at my ass and say,Ooh,

69
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,620
<3-25,Penny>"因为果酱不会这样晃动" 一点也不性感
<3-25,Penny>it must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,240
<3-25,Penny>还有最重要的 我们没有在跳探戈 我们没有你推我拉
<3-25,Penny>And most important,we are not dancing a tango,we're not to'ing and fro'ing.

71
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,320
<3-25,Penny>我们之间不会有什么 永远不会
<3-25,Penny>Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.

72
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,380
<3-26,Howard>等一下 这不是在调情 你在说真的?
<3-26,Howard>Wait a minute. This isn't flirting. You're serious.

73
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,710
<3-27,Penny>调情? 你认为我在跟你调情?
<3-27,Penny>Flirting? You think I'm flirting with you?

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,070
<3-27,Penny>我根本没有在和你调情
<3-27,Penny>I am not flirting with you.

75
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,980
<3-27,Penny>没有女人会和你调情
<3-27,Penny>No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,280
<3-27,Penny>你只会慢慢变老 孤独而终
<3-27,Penny>You're just gonna grow old and die alone.

77
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,410
<3-28,Howard>谢谢你的提醒
<3-28,Howard>Thanks for the heads up.

78

<3-29,Leonard>霍华德 你去哪里?
<3-29,Leonard>Howard,where you going?

79

<3-30,Howard>我回家继续过我的 恶心的可悲的人生
<3-30,Howard>I'm going home to live my creepy,pathetic life.

80
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,910
<3-32,Penny>总得有人说吧
<3-32,Penny>Well,someone had to say it.

81
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,890
<3-32,Penny>什么?
<3-32,Penny>What?

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,090
<3-33,Leonard>他说也许我们该拿你参加机器人杀手大赛
<3-33,Leonard>He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.

83
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,570
<4-1,Howard’s Mother (voice)>霍华德 电话在响!
<4-1,Howard’s Mother (voice)>Howard,the phone is ringing!

<4-7,Howard’s Mother (voice)>要我叫莱纳德把你的家庭作业带来吗?
<4-7,Howard’s Mother (voice)>Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework? !

<5-2,Leonard>不知道 他们正为冰棒问题吵呢
<5-2,Leonard>I don't know,now they're just yelling about Popsicles.

102
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,270
<5-2,Leonard>好像佩妮真地伤到他了
<5-2,Leonard>Sounds like Penny really got to him.

103
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,170
<5-3,Raj>我觉得不意外呀
<5-3,Raj>I'm not surprised.

104
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,220
<5-3,Raj>尽管霍华德用坚强的外壳来保护自己 其实他是个非常敏感的人
<5-3,Raj>Despite his hard and crusty shell,Howard is a very sensitive man.

105
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,860
<5-3,Raj>知道他还写诗吗?
<5-3,Raj>Do you know he writes poetry?

<5-3,Raj>Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave,

107
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,090
<5-3,Raj>但他是用心去写的
<5-3,Raj>but he does it with real sensitivity.

<5-4,Kripke (arriving)>嘿 霍夫施塔特
<5-4,Kripke (arriving)>Hey,Hofstadter.

<5-7,Kripke>Well,if you have any dewusions about entering him against my wobot,

113
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,820
<5-7,Kripke>对抗我克里帕奇 克里骇人的机器银
<5-7,Kripke>the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Robot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational,

114
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,300
<5-7,Kripke>又简称S.c.r.f.l.r.r.i
<5-7,Kripke>aka the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.,

115
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,360
<5-7,Kripke>他就该改名叫金属废物银了
<5-7,Kripke>his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.

116
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,770
<5-8,Leonard>得了吧 真的非要这样吗?
<5-8,Leonard>Come on,is that really necessary?

117
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,510
<5-9,Sheldon>莱纳德 看来需要的
<5-9,Sheldon>Leonard,I believe it is.

118
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,620
<5-9,Sheldon>这是上场前嘴上较劲 是所有竞技的传统部分
<5-9,Sheldon>This is trash talk,and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events.

119
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,130
<5-9,Sheldon>克里帕奇 你的机器人很差劲 会败在我们的脚下
<5-9,Sheldon>Kripke,your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours

120
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,530
<5-9,Sheldon>因为我们在设计与做工上都超越你
<5-9,Sheldon>because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution.

121
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,570
<5-9,Sheldon>还有 我听说你老妈是肥婆
<5-9,Sheldon>Also,I'm given to understand that your mother is overweight.

122
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,080
<5-10,Raj>哇 够狠呀
<5-10,Raj>Oh,snap.

123
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,190
<5-11,Sheldon>当然 如果是腺分泌的关系 而没有懒散和贪食
<5-11,Sheldon>Now,of course,if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony,

124
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,790
<5-11,Sheldon>我收回我的批判
<5-11,Sheldon>I withdraw that comment.

125
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,060
<5-12,Raj>哪有什么区别?胖还是胖呀
<5-12,Raj>What difference does it make? Fat is fat.

126
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,050
<5-13,Sheldon>有分界线的
<5-13,Sheldon>There are boundaries.

127
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,230
<5-14,Kripke>听好了 忘了S.c.r.f.l.r.r.i.
<5-14,Kripke>Tell you what,forget the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.

128
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,810
<5-14,Kripke>偶棉来个机器银一对一吧
<5-14,Kripke>Wet's settle this woboto a woboto.

129
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,320
<5-15,Sheldon>什么意思?
<5-15,Sheldon>What do you mean?

130
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,120
<5-16,Kripke>循环晒上我们不一定碰得上
<5-16,Kripke>There's no guarantee we're gonna go against each other in the Wound Wobin,

131
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,200
<5-16,Kripke>咱现在就对决吧
<5-16,Kripke>so let's throw down.

132
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,440
<5-16,Kripke>要是怕怕就算鸟
<5-16,Kripke>You know,unless you're afwaid.

133
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,780
<5-17,Sheldon>我们接受你的挑战 定个时间和地点吧
<5-17,Sheldon>We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.

134
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,440
<5-18,Kripke>明天 3:00 动力学实验室
<5-18,Kripke>Tomorrow,3:00,the kinetics wab.

135
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,450
<5-19,Sheldon>就这么说定了
<5-19,Sheldon>Make it so.

136
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,470
<5-20,Leonard>不 别定下来 贝瑞 我们明天不能和你战斗
<5-20,Leonard>No,don't make it so. Barry,we can't fight you tomorrow.

137
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,720
<5-20,Leonard>我们的工程师崩溃了
<5-20,Leonard>Our engineer is incapacitated.

138
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,750
<5-21,Kripke>他怎么了?
<5-21,Kripke>What's wrong with him?

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,560
<5-22,Raj>他可悲又古怪 找不到女人 所以他抑郁了
<5-22,Raj>He's depressed because he's pathetic and creepy and can't get girls.

140
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,410
<5-23,Kripke>我们都可悲又古怪 找不到女人
<5-23,Kripke>We're all pathetic and cweepy and can't get girls.

141
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,750
<5-23,Kripke>所以我们才玩机器银格斗
<5-23,Kripke>That's why we fight wobots.

142
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,200
<5-23,Kripke>如果不出现 就等着当笑柄吧
<5-23,Kripke>If you're not there,you'll be exposed to widicule.

143
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,510
<5-24,Raj>我很好奇 他这说的是啥方言啊?
<5-24,Raj>I'm curious,what part of America is that accent from?

144
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,490
<6-2,Leonard>嘿 有时间吗?
<6-2,Leonard>Hey,you got a minute?

145
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,910
<6-3,Penny>有 进来吧 啥事呢?
<6-3,Penny>Yeah,come on in. What's up?

146
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,150
<6-4,Leonard>- 我需要你去给霍华德道... - 滚出去
<6-4,Leonard>- I need you to apologize to How... - Get out.

147
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,710
<6-6,Leonard>行行好吧 沃尔伍兹不肯出来 我们的机器人大战需要他呀
<6-6,Leonard>Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.

148
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,150
<6-7,Penny>那让机器人找他去
<6-7,Penny>Well,then have the robot go and get him.

149
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,830
<6-8,Leonard>机器人又没伤他自尊
<6-8,Leonard>The robot didn't hurt his feelings.

150
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
<6-9,Penny>他就是欠骂
<6-9,Penny>His feelings needed to be hurt.

151
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,600
<6-10,Leonard>他躺在床上两天了
<6-10,Leonard>He's been in bed for two days.

152
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,410
<6-11,Penny>那也好 可能是和充气娃娃玩呢
<6-11,Penny>Yeah,probably with a blow-up doll.

153
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,090
<6-12,Leonard>他没有和...
<6-12,Leonard>He's not with a...

154
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,020
<6-12,Leonard>他和谁在一起玩真的重要吗?
<6-12,Leonard>Does it really matter who or what he's with?

155
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,680
<6-12,Leonard>那家伙崩溃了
<6-12,Leonard>The guy is devastated.

156
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,270
<6-13,Penny>请问 我怎么可能把霍华德弄崩溃?
<6-13,Penny>Oh,please,how could I possibly devastate Howard?

157
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,710
<6-14,Leonard>好吧 我不是批评你
<6-14,Leonard>Okay,don't take this as a criticism,

158
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,840
<6-14,Leonard>但你有时会发生暴露在致命的 伽马射线之下那种状况
<6-14,Leonard>but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.

159
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,410
<6-15,Penny>那啥意思?
<6-15,Penny>What does that mean?

160
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,410
<6-16,Leonard>比如 大多数时候 你是和气的你
<6-16,Leonard>You know,like,most of the time,you're the easygoing Bruce Banner,

161
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,290
<6-16,Leonard>但当你生气时 就好像变成了...
<6-16,Leonard>but then,when you get angry,you kind of turn into,like,you know...

162
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,750
<6-17,Penny>成熊了?
<6-17,Penny>I turn into a bear?

163
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,120
<6-18,Leonard>不是吧? 伽马射线? 你?
<6-18,Leonard>Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner?

164
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,750
<6-18,Leonard>这都联想不到绿巨人?
<6-18,Leonard>You didn't get The Incredible Hulk from that?

165
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,990
<6-18,Leonard>没关系 只是请你去和他谈谈
<6-18,Leonard>Never mind. Just,please go talk to him.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,080
<6-19,Penny>说啥呀? 说我并不是那个意思 可我就是那个意思呀
<6-19,Penny>And say what? That I didn't mean it,because I meant it.

167
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,600
<6-20,Leonard>也许你可以从另外一个角度来谈 比如 嗯
<6-20,Leonard>Well,maybe you can go at it from a different angle,like,um,

168
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,050
<6-20,Leonard>你在他身上看到善良的闪光点 你那天那么说只是
<6-20,Leonard>you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said

169
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,970
<6-20,Leonard>因为你想鼓舞它 让它放大闪光
<6-20,Leonard>because you want to nurture it and make it shine.

170
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,380
<6-22,Leonard>好吧 试试这个方法呢
<6-22,Leonard>Okay,let's try it this way.

171
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,810
<6-22,Leonard>还记得我们邂逅那天
<6-22,Leonard>Remember the day that we first met

172
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,520
<6-22,Leonard>你让我去你男朋友家里 替你把电视要回来
<6-22,Leonard>and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back

173
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,170
<6-22,Leonard>他有九英尺高 把我裤子都扒了 然后你说...
<6-22,Leonard>and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said...

174
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,910
<6-22,Leonard>什么来着? 你说什么来着?
<6-22,Leonard>What was that? What did you say?

175
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,380
<6-22,Leonard>噢 对了 你说你欠我个人情
<6-22,Leonard>Oh,yes. You said you owed me one.

176
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,000
<6-23,Penny>嗷 得了吧 这不公平
<6-23,Penny>Okay,come on,that's not fair.

177
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,980
<6-24,Leonard>我没穿裤子就回家了
<6-24,Leonard>I came home with no pants.

178
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,480
<6-25,Penny>得 我明天去一趟
<6-25,Penny>Fine,I'll go over there tomorrow.

179
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,840
<6-26,Leonard>多谢
<6-26,Leonard>Thank you.

180
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,570
<6-26,Leonard>我该提醒你 要当心他妈妈
<6-26,Leonard>I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.

181
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,240
<6-27,Penny>她怎么了?
<6-27,Penny>What about her?

182
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,070
<6-28,Leonard>她是个讨喜的人 你会爱上她的
<6-28,Leonard>She's a delightful woman. You'll love her.

183
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,620
<7-1,Howard’s Mother (voice)>霍华德 有个叫帕西的金发女郎来找你!
<7-1,Howard’s Mother (voice)>Howard,there's a blonde girl,Patsy,here to see you!

<7-4,Howard>我不想同她说话
<7-4,Howard>I don't want to talk to her.

187
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,480
<7-6,Howard>妈!
<7-6,Howard>Ma!

188
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,340
<7-7,Howard’s Mother (voice)>她径自跑了过去
<7-7,Howard’s Mother (voice)>She ran past me.

189
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,090
<7-7,Howard’s Mother (voice)>我应该把她扑倒?
<7-7,Howard’s Mother (voice)>Was I supposed to tackle her?

190
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,200
<7-8,Penny>呃 我只是过来看看你怎么样了
<7-8,Penny>So,I just came by to see how you were doing.

<7-11,Howard>她坐公车的时候 别人都离她远远的
<7-11,Howard>People move away from her on the bus.

<7-11,Howard>有何贵干?
<7-11,Howard>What do you want?

<7-16,Penny>So close.

209
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,640
<8-1,Leonard>噢 我的天呐 那是克里帕奇的机器人?
<8-1,Leonard>Oh,my God. That's Kripke's robot?

210
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,520
<8-2,Kripke (voice)>如你所见 克里骇人正把这辆 雪佛兰跑车史得粉碎
<8-2,Kripke (voice)>As you can see,the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.

211
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,210
<8-3,Raj>我不能再看下去了
<8-3,Raj>I can't watch anymore.

212
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,780
<8-4,Leonard>谢尔顿 我们得叫停它
<8-4,Leonard>Sheldon,we have to call it off.

213
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,260
<8-5,Sheldon>没有这个选项
<8-5,Sheldon>We don't have that option.

214
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,530
<8-5,Sheldon>我们接受了挑战
<8-5,Sheldon>We've accepted the challenge.

215
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,980
<8-5,Sheldon>我们不能临阵退缩
<8-5,Sheldon>We can't run away from a fight.

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,010
<8-6,Leonard>噢 得了吧 我们不是一直 都在临阵退缩么
<8-6,Leonard>Oh,please,we've spent our whole lives running away from fights.

217
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,340
<8-6,Leonard>个人而言 我都能从比我小一半的 篱笆墙当中找个洞钻过去
<8-6,Leonard>Personally,I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.

218
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,870
<8-7,Sheldon>你说的可能没错 但猛械可不是我们
<8-7,Sheldon>Impressive as that may be,Monte is not us.

219
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,020
<8-7,Sheldon>猛械无所畏惧
<8-7,Sheldon>Monte has no fear.

220
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,380
<8-8,Raj>谢尔顿 难道我们看的不是同一个录像?
<8-8,Raj>Sheldon,did we all not just watch the same video?

221
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,480
<8-8,Raj>克里帕奇的机器人刚刚虐完一辆中型汽车
<8-8,Raj>Kripke's robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.

222
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,760
<8-9,Sheldon>但你忽视了一个事实 我们已经对敌人了如指掌
<8-9,Sheldon>You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we're up against

223
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,320
<8-9,Sheldon>所以我们可以改装猛械 让他做好迎战的准备
<8-9,Sheldon>and we can modify Monte so that he's prepared.

224
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,680
<8-10,Leonard>你想让他做好准备?
<8-10,Leonard>You want to prepare him?

225
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,330
<8-10,Leonard>给他装个膀胱再穿条短裤 他就可以吓得尿裤子了
<8-10,Leonard>Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.

226
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,530
<8-11,Raj>抱歉 不过没有沃尔伍兹 我们怎么进行改装?
<8-11,Raj>Excuse me,but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz?

227
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,170
<8-11,Raj>- 佩妮那有信了没? - 还没
<8-11,Raj>- Have you heard from Penny yet? - Not yet.

228
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,820
<8-13,Sheldon>打起自信来 先生们 我们不需要沃尔伍兹帮忙
<8-13,Sheldon>Have faith,gentlemen. We don't need Wolowitz.

229
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,730
<8-13,Sheldon>工程学只是物理学 发育迟缓的小弟罢了
<8-13,Sheldon>Engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics.

230
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,500
<8-13,Sheldon>瞧好了 学着点
<8-13,Sheldon>Watch and learn.

231
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,510
<8-13,Sheldon>你们俩有谁知道怎么开工具箱么?
<8-13,Sheldon>Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?

232
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,070
<9-1,Howard>之后 在我十四岁的时候 我遇见了马尔西·格罗斯曼
<9-1,Howard>And then,when I was 14,I met Marcy Grossman.

233
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,990
<9-1,Howard>她是拉摸美丽
<9-1,Howard>She was so beautiful.

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,700
<9-1,Howard>她刚摘掉牙套 但还是有点龅牙
<9-1,Howard>She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite.

235
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,580
<9-1,Howard>真是火辣
<9-1,Howard>It was so hot.

236
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,300
<9-1,Howard>就像只性感的小花栗鼠
<9-1,Howard>Like a sexy little chipmunk.

237
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,520
<9-1,Howard>我没有勇气约她出来
<9-1,Howard>I didn't have the courage to ask her out,

238
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,080
<9-1,Howard>但我在初三的才艺表演上 给她献了一首歌
<9-1,Howard>but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.

239
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,610
<9-2,Penny>喔 真贴心
<9-2,Penny>Aw,that sounds sweet.

240
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,130
<9-3,Howard>* 马尔西·格罗斯曼就是阴天的 *
<9-3,Howard>* Marcy Grossman is sunshine *

241
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,840
<9-3,Howard>* 一缕阳光 *
<9-3,Howard>* On a cloudy day *

242
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,620
<9-3,Howard>* 在天寒地冻时 *
<9-3,Howard>* When it's cold outside *

243
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,500
<9-3,Howard>* 马尔西·格罗斯曼就是那热情的五月 *
<9-3,Howard>* Marcy Grossman is the month of May *

244
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,620
<9-4,Penny>噢 真是可爱
<9-4,Penny>Oh,it's cute.

245
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,120
<9-4,Penny>* 我猜你会说 *
<9-4,Penny>* I guess you'd say *

246
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,650
<9-5,Howard>* 什么才能让我有这种感觉 *
<9-5,Howard>* What can make me feel this way *

247
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,220
<9-5,Howard>* 马尔西·格罗斯曼,马尔西·格罗斯曼,马尔西·格罗斯曼 *
<9-5,Howard>* Marcy Grossman,Marcy Grossman,Marcy Grossman *

248
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,720
<9-5,Howard>- * 谈论着马尔西 * - 真棒
<9-5,Howard>* Talkin' 'bout Marcy * That's great.

249
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,610
<9-7,Howard>* 格罗斯曼 *
<9-7,Howard>* Grossman.*

250
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,010
<9-8,Penny>噢 真有意思
<9-8,Penny>Oh,it's fun.

251
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,530
<9-9,Howard>然后她撅着那张性感的花栗鼠小嘴
<9-9,Howard>And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth

252
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,000
<9-9,Howard>朝我头发上淬了口唾沫
<9-9,Howard>and spit in my hair.

253
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,560
<9-9,Howard>之后就是高一的事了
<9-9,Howard>Which brings us to tenth grade.

254
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,180
<9-10,Penny>霍华德 你觉不觉得有时 自己太心急太过火了?
<9-10,Penny>Howard,do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?

255
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,310
<9-11,Howard>看看我嘛
<9-11,Howard>Look at me.

256
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,280
<9-11,Howard>太心急太过火 我怎么可能会有机会?
<9-11,Howard>What chance do I have if I don't try too hard?

257
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,640
<9-12,Penny>这... 你的机会大大的有
<9-12,Penny>Well... you'd have a terrific chance.

258
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,410
<9-12,Penny>你聪明风趣 又有份好工作
<9-12,Penny>I mean,you're smart,you're funny. You have a cool job.

259
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,290
<9-12,Penny>你做那个飞到外太空的东西
<9-12,Penny>You build stuff that goes into outer space.

260
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,200
<9-13,Howard>也是啊
<9-13,Howard>I guess.

261
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,490
<9-14,Penny>跟你说哦 我认识你也有一年半了
<9-14,Penny>Look,I'm telling you,I've known you for,like,a year and a half

262
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,670
<9-14,Penny>这次我才觉得我是在跟你真人讲话
<9-14,Penny>and this is the first time I feel like I'm talking to a real person.

263
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,230
<9-14,Penny>而且你知道不 我喜欢他 他人不错
<9-14,Penny>And you know what? I like him. He's a nice guy.

264
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,860
<9-15,Howard>你真的这么想的?
<9-15,Howard>You really think so?

265
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,940
<9-16,Penny>是啊
<9-16,Penny>Yes.

266
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,250
<9-17,Howard>这我还真的不知道
<9-17,Howard>I don't know.

267
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,460
<9-18,Penny>我知道
<9-18,Penny>I do.

268
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,010
<10-1,Leonard>你这小机器人不错嘛
<10-1,Leonard>Nice little bot you've got here.

269
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,980
<10-2,Kripke>这我知道
<10-2,Kripke>I'm aware.

270
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,630
<10-4,Kripke>- 这是干嘛用的? 转齿? - 对 3400转每分钟
<10-4,Kripke>- What's this do,spin? - Yep. At 3400 RPM.

271
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,640
<10-4,Kripke>它切钢就像切橡皮一样
<10-4,Kripke>It can cut through steel like it was wubber.

272
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,710
<10-5,Leonard>赞
<10-5,Leonard>Neat.

273
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,840
<10-5,Leonard>做得不错
<10-5,Leonard>Good work.

274
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,960
<10-5,Leonard>谢尔顿 我们要赶快取消
<10-5,Leonard>Sheldon,we've got to call this off.

275
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,280
<10-6,Sheldon>不要 莱纳德
<10-6,Sheldon>No,Leonard.

276
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,110
<10-6,Sheldon>多少年了 像克里帕奇一样的无良恶霸 让我的生活悲惨不堪
<10-6,Sheldon>For years,merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies

278
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,800
<10-6,Sheldon>既被痛打又受尽凌辱 还有印第安刑
<10-6,Sheldon>and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns.

279
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,210
<10-6,Sheldon>这些就此打住!
<10-6,Sheldon>That stops now.

280
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,560
<10-7,Raj>可是谢尔顿 我们没可能的
<10-7,Raj>But,Sheldon,we don't have a chance.

281
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,400
<10-7,Raj>你现在能给这机器人改进的 就是给它遥控器换块新电池
<10-7,Raj>The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.

282
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,890
<10-8,Sheldon>你没发觉的是克里帕奇有一个致命伤
<10-8,Sheldon>What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw:

283
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,370
<10-8,Sheldon>他对机器人大体积超能量的过度自信
<10-8,Sheldon>overconfidence from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power.

284
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,430
<10-9,Raj>那不是过度自信 那叫观察
<10-9,Raj>That's not overconfidence. That's observation.

285
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,810
<10-10,Sheldon>信我 克里帕奇很快就会倒在 我的心理战上的 观察吧
<10-10,Sheldon>Trust me,Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe.

286
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,500
<10-10,Sheldon>克里帕奇
<10-10,Sheldon>Kripke.

287
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,820
<10-10,Sheldon>我想问下你的机器人准备好见它制作人没 不过既然你是他的制作人了
<10-10,Sheldon>I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker,but as you are its maker,

288
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,700
<10-10,Sheldon>很明显你们是见过面了
<10-10,Sheldon>clearly the two of you have met.

289
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,900
<10-11,Kripke>他脑子怎么鸟?
<10-11,Kripke>What is his pwoblem?

290
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,370
<10-12,Raj>学绝地武士心理战还差得远 伙计
<10-12,Raj>Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks,dude.

291
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,100
<10-13,Leonard>我只是想确认下我们说好了
<10-13,Leonard>I just want to make sure that we're all clear.

292
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,070
<10-13,Leonard>按照标准机器人格斗联盟规则
<10-13,Leonard>Standard robotic fighting league rules apply.

293
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,720
<10-14,Kripke>你是疯了不成? 这是个街战
<10-14,Kripke>Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight.

294
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,900
<10-14,Kripke>街战哪有什么规则的?
<10-14,Kripke>The stweet has no rules.

295
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,430
<10-15,Sheldon>他说得对 莱纳德 一直到死为直
<10-15,Sheldon>He's right,Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.

296
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,670
<10-16,Kripke>不过我现在给你们个机会承认 我是比你们优越
<10-16,Kripke>I will,however,give you the opportunity to concede my superiority now

297
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,100
<10-16,Kripke>然后把你的机器人给我当战利品
<10-16,Kripke>and offer me your robot as the spoils of war.

298
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,600
<10-17,Sheldon>永远都没可能!
<10-17,Sheldon>Never.

299
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,940
<10-17,Sheldon>我宁愿猛械死都不要落到你手里
<10-17,Sheldon>I'd rather see Monte dead than in your hands.

300
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,530
<10-18,Kripke>那真是小菜一碟
<10-18,Kripke>That could be easily arranged.

301
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,220
<10-20,Kripke>各就各位准备开始?
<10-20,Kripke>Ready,set,go?

302
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,480
<10-19,Sheldon>来吧
<10-19,Sheldon>Do it.

303
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,860
<10-20,Kripke>那好吧 预备 开始
<10-20,Kripke>All right then. Weady. Set. Go.

304
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,970
<10-21,Raj>来吧 谢尔顿 你可以的
<10-21,Raj>Come on,Sheldon,you got this.

305
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,380
<10-22,Sheldon>当然 我们做好了万全准备 他怎么对我们都不怕
<10-22,Sheldon>Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.

306
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,910
<10-22,Sheldon>这招是新的
<10-22,Sheldon>That's new.

307
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,450
<10-23,Leonard>- 逃啊 猛械! 逃! - 闪啊 Mont!
<10-23,Leonard>- Run,Monte,run! - Go,Monte!

308
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,560
<10-25,Leonard>- 猛械! - 跑! 跑! 跑! 跑!
<10-25,Leonard>- Monte! - Go,go,go,go!

309
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,530
<10-26,Sheldon>别伤害我们! 别伤害我们! 别伤害我们!
<10-26,Sheldon>Don't hurt us,don't hurt us,don't hurt us!

310
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,890
<11-1,Leonard>好了 弥补儿时心灵创伤就到此为止了
<11-1,Leonard>Well,so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.

311
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,780
<11-2,Sheldon>是我干的
<11-2,Sheldon>I did this.

312
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,080
<11-2,Sheldon>猛械被杀都是因为我的傲慢跟自大
<11-2,Sheldon>Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride.

313
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,400
<11-2,Sheldon>不管别人怎么说 这都是我的错
<11-2,Sheldon>No matter what anybody says,this is my fault.

314
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,920
<11-3,Raj>又没人在跟你争
<11-3,Raj>No one's arguing with you,dude.

315
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,360
<11-4,Howard (arriving)>我收到你短信了 它有多烂... 噢
<11-4,Howard (arriving)>I got your text. How bad is... Oy.

316
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,020
<11-5,Leonard>先别管那机器人了 你是怎么了?
<11-5,Leonard>Forget the robot. What happened to you?

317
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,680
<11-6,Penny>他不小心滑倒了
<11-6,Penny>He slipped and fell.

318
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,770
<11-7,Howard>是 我不小心滑倒了 还是在浴室里
<11-7,Howard>Yes,I slipped and fell. In the bathroom.

319
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,730
<11-7,Howard>被浴缸弹起来了
<11-7,Howard>Bounced right off the tub.

320
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,900
<11-8,Penny>对 现在他知道了 如果他不尊重浴缸的话 浴缸会给他好看的
<11-8,Penny>Yes,now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don't treat them with respect.

321
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,850
<11-8,Penny>那是
<11-8,Penny>Yeah.

322
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
<11-9,Howard>趁你闭眼时就给你一拳
<11-9,Howard>They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.

323
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,370
<11-10,Sheldon>你觉得怎样 霍华德?
<11-10,Sheldon>So what do you think,Howard?

324
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,960
<11-10,Sheldon>也不算很烂 对吧?
<11-10,Sheldon>It's not that bad,right?

325
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,910
<11-11,Howard>噢 不算 用点电线包布 一些焊剂... 你是疯了还是怎样?!
<11-11,Howard>Oh,no. A little electrical tape,some solder... Are you insane?

326
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,190
<11-11,Howard>太空探测器坠毁在沙漠都比这死相好看
<11-11,Howard>I've seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.

327
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,950
<11-12,Sheldon>你说得对 猛械走了
<11-12,Sheldon>You're right. Monte's gone.

328
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,780
<11-12,Sheldon>我们明早去埋了它 做个简单的仪式 我来主持
<11-12,Sheldon>We'll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

329
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,730
<11-12,Sheldon>莱纳德 你要拉你的大提琴
<11-12,Sheldon>Leonard,you'll play your cello.

330
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,050
<11-13,Penny>谢尔顿 亲爱的 你是不是有点走火入魔了?
<11-13,Penny>Sheldon,honey,aren't you getting a little carried away?

331
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,060
<11-14,Sheldon>我是说 这不就是个机器人嘛
<11-14,Sheldon>I mean,it's just a toy robot.

332
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,460
<11-14,Sheldon>不就是个机器人嘛?
<11-14,Sheldon>Just a toy robot?

333
