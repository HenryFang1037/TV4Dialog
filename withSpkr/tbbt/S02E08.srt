1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,300
<1-1,Sheldon>看啊  开始放《土星3号》了
<1-1,Sheldon>Oh, look,  Saturn 3 is on.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,630
<1-2,Raj>我不想看《土星3号》
<1-2,Raj>I don't want to watch  Saturn 3.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,030
<1-2,Raj>《深空9号》比这好多了
<1-2,Raj>Deep Space Nine is better.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,800
<1-3,Sheldon>《深空9号》怎么可能比得过《土星三号》
<1-3,Sheldon>How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,560
<1-4,Raj>你算一算就知道9比3大6
<1-4,Raj>Simple subtraction will tell you it's six better.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,460
<1-5,Leonard>折衷一下吧 看《巴比伦5号》
<1-5,Leonard>Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,530
<1-6,Sheldon>你凭什么认为这是折衷的办法
<1-6,Sheldon>In what sense is that a compromise?

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,230
<1-7,Leonard>5是在3和...  当我没说
<1-7,Leonard>Well, five is partway between three... Never mind.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,360
<1-8,Raj>不如这样吧
<1-8,Raj>I'll tell you what.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,060
<1-8,Raj>我们石头剪刀布决定
<1-8,Raj>How about we go rock-paper-scissors?

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,300
<1-9,Sheldon>我看这样不行
<1-9,Sheldon>Ooh, I don't think so.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,130
<1-9,Sheldon>大量的实例研究表明
<1-9,Sheldon>Anecdotal evidence suggests

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,730
<1-9,Sheldon>在石头剪刀布中
<1-9,Sheldon>that in the game of rock-paper-scissors,

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,100
<1-9,Sheldon>如果让互相熟悉的玩家进行一定局数的游戏
<1-9,Sheldon>players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,530
<1-9,Sheldon>那么其中有百分之75到80是打平的
<1-9,Sheldon>due to the limited number of outcomes.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,900
<1-9,Sheldon>我推荐玩石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克[星际旅行3里的人物]
<1-9,Sheldon>I suggest rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,530
<1-10,Raj>什么
<1-10,Raj>What?

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,330
<1-11,Sheldon>非常简单的
<1-11,Sheldon>It's very simple.

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,900
<1-11,Sheldon>剪刀剪布  布包石头
<1-11,Sheldon>Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock.

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,260
<1-11,Sheldon>石头砸死蜥蜴
<1-11,Sheldon>Rock crushes lizard.

21
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,530
<1-11,Sheldon>蜥蜴毒死史波克
<1-11,Sheldon>Lizard poisons Spock.

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,430
<1-11,Sheldon>史波克踩碎剪刀  剪刀将蜥蜴斩首
<1-11,Sheldon>Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,960
<1-11,Sheldon>蜥蜴吃掉纸[同义布]  论文[同义布]证明史波克不存在
<1-11,Sheldon>Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock.

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,700
<1-11,Sheldon>史波克把石头融化
<1-11,Sheldon>Spock vaporizes rock.

25
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,860
<1-11,Sheldon>最后和以前一样  石头敲坏剪刀
<1-11,Sheldon>And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,500
<1-12,Raj>好  我明白了
<1-12,Raj>Okay, I think I got it.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,500
<1-13,Together>石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克
<1-13,Together>Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock!

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,930
<1-14,Howard (entering, wearing an eye patch)>孩子们好
<1-14,Howard (entering, wearing an eye patch)>Hello, boys.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,830
<1-15,Leonard>这位兄台好
<1-15,Leonard>Ahoy, matey.

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,960
<1-16,Howard>注意到我的眼罩了是吗
<1-16,Howard>Noticed the eye patch, did you?

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,060
<1-16,Howard>这是一个我最近正在研究的
<1-16,Howard>It's all part of a technique I've been studying

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,660
<1-16,Howard>勾搭女人的新技术
<1-16,Howard>for picking up women.

33
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,460
<1-16,Howard>只需使用一个显示屏
<1-16,Howard>You employ a visual display

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,300
<1-16,Howard>就可以为你设计出一套
<1-16,Howard>designed to make yourself

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,300
<1-16,Howard>与众不同夺人眼球的造型
<1-16,Howard>distinctive and memorable.

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,930
<1-17,Sheldon>是啊  就像是雄孔雀那漂亮的羽毛
<1-17,Sheldon>Oh, yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,530
<1-17,Sheldon>或者像发情的狒狒那饱满的臀部
<1-17,Sheldon>or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,360
<1-18,Leonard>或者就像是得了红眼病的犹太小男孩
<1-18,Leonard>Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.

39
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,060
<1-19,Howard>随便你怎么笑我  但这真招的很有用
<1-19,Howard>Mock me if you will, but it works.

40
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,130
<1-19,Howard>你可以穿着奇装异服进入一个派对
<1-19,Howard>You show up at a club in something distinctive,

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,860
<1-19,Howard>搜索目标  然后向她发起消极攻势
<1-19,Howard>scope out your target and toss out some negs.

42
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,860
<1-20,Raj>什么是消极攻势
<1-20,Raj>What are negs?

43
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,330
<1-21,Howard>消极攻势就是给她一些消极的评价
<1-21,Howard>A neg is a negative compliment

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,300
<1-21,Howard>好让她不要凌驾于你之上
<1-21,Howard>that throws a pretty woman off her game,

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,700
<1-21,Howard>举个例子  一般我对大牙齿很没爱
<1-21,Howard>like "Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth,

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,530
<1-21,Howard>但在你嘴里就显得很可爱
<1-21,Howard>but on you, they work."

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,660
<1-21,Howard>这样的台词我有一箩筐  谁想做我的泡妞搭档
<1-21,Howard>I got a whole list of 'em. Who wants to be my wingman?

48
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,000
<1-22,Leonard>你不需要搭档
<1-22,Leonard>You're not gonna need wingman.

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,860
<1-22,Leonard>我看你是需要去看病
<1-22,Leonard>You're gonna need a paramedic.

50
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,800
<1-23,Penny (entering)>霍华德  你的小摩托挡住我的车了
<1-23,Penny (entering)>Howard, your scooter's blocking my car.

51
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,700
<1-23,Penny (entering)>啊呀  你又得红眼病了?
<1-23,Penny (entering)>Aw, did you get pinkeye again?

52
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,660
<1-24,Howard>首先  她注意到我的眼罩了
<1-24,Howard>Step one: she notices the eye patch.

53
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,030
<1-24,Howard>恕我直言  佩妮
<1-24,Howard>May I say, Penny,

54
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,000
<1-24,Howard>一般头发如此恶心的女人们
<1-24,Howard>not a lot of women could look as hot as you do

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,160
<1-24,Howard>是没你这么漂亮的
<1-24,Howard>with such greasy hair?

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,130
<1-25,Penny>快去把你那辆破摩托挪开
<1-25,Penny>Yeah, just move your stupid scooter

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,500
<1-25,Penny>否则我就去把它扔进垃圾箱
<1-25,Penny>before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.

58
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,530
<1-26,Howard>疼
<1-26,Howard>Ow.

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,600
<2-1,Sheldon>不好意思  在我还没看《克隆战争》这部电影之前
<2-1,Sheldon>I'm sorry, but I'm not going to watch The Clone Wars TV series

60
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,830
<2-1,Sheldon>我是不会去看《克隆战争》的电视剧的
<2-1,Sheldon>until I've seen  The e Clone Wars movie.

61
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,660
<2-1,Sheldon>我想根据乔治·卢卡斯拍片的顺序
<2-1,Sheldon>I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me

62
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,330
<2-1,Sheldon>来欣赏他的烂作
<2-1,Sheldon>in the order he intended.

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
<2-2,Leonard>但我现在就想看这个
<2-2,Leonard>Well, I want to watch it now.

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,160
<2-3,Sheldon>那我认为我们又迎来了一个典型的
<2-3,Sheldon>Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential

65
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,400
<2-3,Sheldon>石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克游戏时刻
<2-3,Sheldon>rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.

66
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,730
<2-4,Leonard>随便你看什么
<2-4,Leonard>Watch whatever you want.

67
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,930
<2-5,Raj>你有一套啊
<2-5,Raj>I saw what you did there.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,460
<2-6,Sheldon>怎么说
<2-6,Sheldon>What'd I do?

69
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,500
<2-7,Leonard (answering phone)>喂  霍华德
<2-7,Leonard (answering phone)>Hello. Hey, Howard.

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,730
<2-7,Leonard (answering phone)>怎么了
<2-7,Leonard (answering phone)>What's wrong?

71
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,030
<2-7,Leonard (answering phone)>好好  我们马上就来
<2-7,Leonard (answering phone)>Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.

72
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,200
<2-8,Sheldon>什么事
<2-8,Sheldon>What happened?

73
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,260
<2-9,Leonard>霍华德说他在火星漫步者实验室  碰到了点麻烦
<2-9,Leonard>Howard's at the Mars Rover lab. He says he's in trouble.

74
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,330
<2-11,Leonard>安全等级5
<2-11,Leonard>Defcon 5.

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
<2-12,Sheldon>安全等级5?
<2-12,Sheldon>Defcon 5?

76
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,400
<2-10,Sheldon>那就没必要这么急了
<2-10,Sheldon>Well, there's no need to rush.

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,560
<2-11,Leonard>什么
<2-11,Leonard>What?

78
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,200
<2-12,Sheldon>等级5是和平时期的协议  没危险
<2-12,Sheldon>Defcon 5 means "no danger."

79
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,400
<2-12,Sheldon>等级1才是紧急情况
<2-12,Sheldon>Defcon 1 is a crisis.

80
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,560
<2-13,Leonard>5怎么可能没1差
<2-13,Leonard>How can 5 not be worse than 1?

81
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,300
<2-14,Raj>就是啊  《星际旅行5》   比1差
<2-14,Raj>Yeah, Star Trek V worse than I.

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,900
<2-15,Sheldon>首先  你比较的是质量
<2-15,Sheldon>Okay, first of all, that's a comparison of quality,

83
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,260
<2-15,Sheldon>而不是紧急程度
<2-15,Sheldon>not intensity.

84
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,730
<2-15,Sheldon>第二  《星际旅行1》和《星际旅行5》相比
<2-15,Sheldon>Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,430
<2-15,Sheldon>简直就是老鼠比大象
<2-15,Sheldon>than Star Trek V.

86
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,860
<2-16,Raj>你在开什么玩笑  《星际旅行5》已经成为
<2-16,Raj>Are you joking?  Star Trek V is the standard

87
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,900
<2-16,Raj>劣质品测量的标杆
<2-16,Raj>against which all badness is measured.

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,060
<2-17,Sheldon>不  不
<2-17,Sheldon>No, no.

89
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,600
<2-17,Sheldon>《星际旅行5》差就差在
<2-17,Sheldon>Star Trek V has specific failures

90
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,860
<2-17,Sheldon>编剧和导演
<2-17,Sheldon>in writing and direction,

91
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,530
<2-17,Sheldon>而《星际旅行1》完全就是一无是处
<2-17,Sheldon>while Star Trek I fails across the board:

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,330
<2-17,Sheldon>艺术指导  服装  音乐  音响效果
<2-17,Sheldon>art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,660
<2-18,Leonard>就当我没说什么安全等级好吗  我们快走
<2-18,Leonard>Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?

94
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,130
<2-19,Raj>《星际旅行5》
<2-19,Raj>Star Trek V.

95
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,060
<3-1,Sheldon>至少你也应该承认
<3-1,Sheldon>All right, will you at least stipulate

96
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,130
<3-1,Sheldon>《星际旅行4：抢救未来》毫无疑问是最好的吧
<3-1,Sheldon>that Star Trek IV:  The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?

97
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,330
<3-2,Raj>我给你5个字
<3-2,Raj>I have three words for you:

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,830
<3-2,Raj>《天汗的愤怒》[星际之旅2]
<3-2,Raj>Wrath of Khan.

99
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,830
<3-3,Howard>感谢上帝你们来了
<3-3,Howard>Oh, thank God, you're here.

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,060
<3-4,Leonard>有什么急事
<3-4,Leonard>What's the emergency?

101
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,330
<3-5,Howard>火星漫步者被卡在沟里了
<3-5,Howard>I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.

102
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,460
<3-6,Sheldon>哪里
<3-6,Sheldon>Where?

103
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,630
<3-7,Howard>贝克斯菲尔德城外一条人迹罕至的公路
<3-7,Howard>On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield.

104
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,530
<3-7,Howard>要不然还能在哪  当然是火星!
<3-7,Howard>Where do you think? On Mars!

105
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,230
<3-8,Woman (peering out of door)>霍华德  出什么事了
<3-8,Woman (peering out of door)>Howard, is everything okay?

106
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,730
<3-9,Howard>宝贝  我马上进去
<3-9,Howard>Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.

107
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,890
<3-10,Sheldon>你把一个姑娘带到火星探测器的控制室?
<3-10,Sheldon>You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,230
<3-11,Howard>我在一个酒吧碰到她的  她是个医生
<3-11,Howard>Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She's a doctor.

109
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,060
<3-11,Howard>只要一剂免费的钡剂[灌肠用]
<3-11,Howard>One free barium enema,

110
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,430
<3-11,Howard>我妈根本不会在乎她是不是犹太人
<3-11,Howard>and my mother won't care she's not Jewish.

111
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,560
<3-12,Leonard>等一下
<3-12,Leonard>Wait a minute.

112
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,530
<3-12,Leonard>那么说眼罩及人格侮辱这招管用了?
<3-12,Leonard>So the eye patch and e insults worked?

113
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,890
<3-13,Howard>不  那里还有三个人也带着眼罩
<3-13,Howard>No, there were three other guys with eye patches.

114
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,190
<3-13,Howard>彻底的失败
<3-13,Howard>It was a fiasco.

115
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,260
<3-13,Howard>管用的是这句话:
<3-13,Howard>What did work was, "How'd you like to visit

116
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,690
<3-13,Howard>"愿不愿意去个秘密政府部门看看?"
<3-13,Howard>a secret government facility?"

117
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,860
<3-14,Sheldon>那你要我们现在做什么呢
<3-14,Sheldon>So what exactly do you want us to do?

118
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,090
<3-15,Howard>你和拉杰帮我把火星探测器从沟里拖出来
<3-15,Howard>I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch

119
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,390
<3-15,Howard>而你要在任何人发现斯蒂芬妮之前
<3-15,Howard>and I need you to get Stephanie out

120
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
<3-15,Howard>帮我把她带走
<3-15,Howard>before somebody notices she's here.

121
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,030
<3-15,Howard>实际上我偷偷带她进来的
<3-15,Howard>She doesn't exactly have clearance.

122
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,760
<3-16,Sheldon>真的么?  难道他们不让从下等酒馆来的
<3-16,Sheldon>Really? They don't let strange women from honky-tonks come in

123
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,990
<3-16,Sheldon>陌生女人来玩在遥远星球上
<3-16,Sheldon>and play with $200 million government projects

124
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,190
<3-16,Sheldon>2亿美金的政府项目么?
<3-16,Sheldon>on distant planets?

125
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,860
<3-17,Howard>我知道我很坏  她可能给我一巴掌
<3-17,Howard>Yes, I was bad. Maybe she'll spank me.

126
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,390
<3-17,Howard>我们能回到问题上来了么?
<3-17,Howard>Can we please move on?

127
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,590
<3-18,Girl>霍华德  时间不早了
<3-18,Girl>Hey, Howard, you know, it's getting late,

128
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,760
<3-18,Girl>我到底还开不开得上车?
<3-18,Girl>so do I get to drive this thing or what?

129
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,630
<3-19,Howard>对不起  出了点紧急情况
<3-19,Howard>Yeah. No. I'm sorry, but something's come up.

130
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,630
<3-19,Howard>我是说火星漫步者  火星漫步者
<3-19,Howard>Kind of a Mars Rover... Mars Rover

131
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,990
<3-19,Howard>呼叫霍华德
<3-19,Howard>can Howard come over...

132
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,860
<3-19,Howard>的状况

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,290
<3-23,Girl>你也是像霍华德一样的科学家么?
<3-23,Girl>Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?

137
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,690
<3-24,Leonard>没有科学家像霍华德那样
<3-24,Leonard>No one's a scientist like Howard.

138
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,860
<3-25,Howard>我妈肯定会很喜欢她
<3-25,Howard>My mother is so gonna love her.

<3-26,Sheldon>How nice. Maybe they can carpool

140
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,130
<3-26,Sheldon>去联邦监狱看你
<3-26,Sheldon>when they visit you in federal prison.

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,060
<4-1,Girl>对不起  打断你的话了
<4-1,Girl>I'm sorry. I totally interrupted you.

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,460
<4-1,Girl>啊?  我们刚才说到哪了?
<4-1,Girl>What, what, what were you saying?

143
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,060
<4-2,Leonard>说霍华德是个非常好的人
<4-2,Leonard>Just said Howard's a terrific guy.

144
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,230
<4-2,Leonard>他很有幽默感
<4-2,Leonard>He's got a great sense of humor.

145
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,860
<4-2,Leonard>他很爱他的妈妈
<4-2,Leonard>He loves his mother...

146
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,130
<4-2,Leonard>非常

147
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,890
<4-2,Leonard>大家都说爱得有点过了
<4-2,Leonard>People say "too much."

148
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,790
<4-3,Girl>你真是个忠实的好朋友
<4-3,Girl>I really like that you're such a loyal friend.

149
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,590
<4-4,Leonard>没错
<4-4,Leonard>Yeah, I am loyal.

150
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,390
<4-4,Leonard>如果从全局来看的话
<4-4,Leonard>You know, if you look at the big picture.

151
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,690
<4-4,Leonard>仅仅是出于好奇
<4-4,Leonard>Out of curiosity,

152
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,430
<4-4,Leonard>他有很吸引你么?
<4-4,Leonard>did he ever have a shot with you?

153
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,430
<4-5,Girl>你疯了么
<4-5,Girl>Are you insane?

154
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,960
<4-5,Girl>他带着个眼罩
<4-5,Girl>The guy was wearing an eye patch.

155
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,330
<4-6,Leonard>那你为什么...
<4-6,Leonard>Then why did you...?

156
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,830
<4-7,Girl>他说我可以在火星上开车
<4-7,Girl>He said that I cou drive a car on Mars.

157
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,960
<4-7,Girl>哦了
<4-7,Girl>Got it.

158
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,260
<4-8,Leonard>我以后还能再见你吗
<4-8,Leonard>So, can I see you again?

159
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,660
<4-9,Girl>你这就见不到我了  闭眼
<4-9,Girl>You're not gonna see me now.

160
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,690
<4-10,Leonard>不错
<4-10,Leonard>Cool.

161
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,760
<5-1,Howard>有什么发现么
<5-1,Howard>Anything?

162
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,460
<5-2,Raj>事实上我在查邮件
<5-2,Raj>Actually, I was just checking my e-mail.

163
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,830
<5-2,Raj>不过漫步者没有消息返回
<5-2,Raj>But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.

164
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,830
<5-3,Sheldon>我有个很恰当的比喻
<5-3,Sheldon>I believe the appropriate metaphor here

165
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,360
<5-3,Sheldon>一艘没有推进设备的
<5-3,Sheldon>involves a river of excrement

166
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,060
<5-3,Sheldon>美国土著的轮船
<5-3,Sheldon>and a Native American water vessel

167
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,660
<5-3,Sheldon>驶进了便便河
<5-3,Sheldon>without any means of propulsion.

168
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,630
<5-4,Howard>拜托
<5-4,Howard>Hang on.

169
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,260
<5-4,Howard>肯定会有办法的
<5-4,Howard>There's got to be other options.

170
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,760
<5-5,Raj>你可以给美国汽车协会打电话
<5-5,Raj>You could try calling Triple-A.

171
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,760
<5-5,Raj>不过根据美国国家航空航天管理局最近的日程安排
<5-5,Raj>But based on NASA's latest timetable,

172
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,730
<5-5,Raj>他们35年后才会到那
<5-5,Raj>they won't get there for 35 years.

173
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,730
<5-6,Sheldon>而且他们到的时候
<5-6,Sheldon>Plus I understand you have to be standing

174
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,490
<5-6,Sheldon>你必须在现场  带着你的会员卡
<5-6,Sheldon>next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.

175
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,730
<5-7,Raj>惨咯
<5-7,Raj>Oh, snap.

176
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,030
<5-8,Sheldon>按什么? [snap也有按钮的意思]
<5-8,Sheldon>Snap what?

177
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,430
<5-9,Howard>好吧  看来我们得进行B计划了
<5-9,Howard>Okay, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.

178
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,690
<5-10,Raj>什么是B计划
<5-10,Raj>What's Plan B?

179
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,290
<5-11,Howard>格式化所有硬盘  清除监控录像
<5-11,Howard>Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes,

180
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,090
<5-11,Howard>擦掉我们留下的所有指纹后逃跑
<5-11,Howard>wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.

181
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,990
<5-12,Sheldon>为什么这不是A计划
<5-12,Sheldon>Why wasn'that Plan A?

182
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,730
<6-1,Voice from television>美国国家航空航天管理局发言人指出由于数据的损失
<6-1,Voice from television>A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data,

183
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,490
<6-1,Voice from television>他们可能无法找出火星漫步者 发生故障的原因
<6-1,Voice from television>they will most likely be unable to determine the cause of the Mars Rover's malfunction.

184
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,290
<6-1,Voice from television>人类对于火星的探索  这种令人失望的结果
<6-1,Voice from television>This is not the first time an exploratory mission to Mars

185
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,590
<6-1,Voice from television>已经不是第一次了
<6-1,Voice from television>has ended in disappointment.

186
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,830
<6-2,Howard>幸亏我们选了B计划
<6-2,Howard>Thank God for Plan B.

187
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,090
<6-3,Penny>霍华德  你不是说过你在研究火星漫步者么
<6-3,Penny>Howard, didn't you say you worked on the Mars Rover?

188
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,630
<6-4,Howard>没有  你搞错了
<6-4,Howard>No, you're mistaken.

189
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,490
<6-5,Penny>我第一次见你那天 你说如果我和你约会
<6-5,Penny>Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you,

190
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,390
<6-5,Penny>我就能在火星上开车
<6-5,Penny>I could drive a car on Mars.

191
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,860
<6-6,Howard>我不知道你在说什么
<6-6,Howard>I don't know what you're talking about.

192
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,190
<6-8,Sheldon>大家不好意思
<6-8,Sheldon>Will you all excuse me?

193
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,490
<6-8,Sheldon>莱纳德正悄悄给我打手势
<6-8,Sheldon>Leonard is subtly signaling

194
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,030
<6-8,Sheldon>示意我要和我私下谈谈
<6-8,Sheldon>that he'd like to talk to me in private.

195
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,830
<6-9,Penny>不会啊  我记得很清楚
<6-9,Penny>No. Yeah, I remember specifically.

196
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,760
<6-9,Penny>你最开始问我是不是从火星来的
<6-9,Penny>You started by asking if I was from Mars

197
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,060
<6-9,Penny>理由是我的屁股真的很翘
<6-9,Penny>because my ass was out of this world.

198
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,660
<6-10,Howard>是挺像我的风格  不过不是
<6-10,Howard>Well, that does sound like me, but no.

199
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,990
<6-11,Sheldon>有问题灭
<6-11,Sheldon>Is there some problem?

200
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,160
<6-11,Sheldon>对
<6-11,Sheldon>Yeah.

201
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,190
<6-12,Leonard>我得出去一小会
<6-12,Leonard>Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.

202
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,760
<6-13,Sheldon>好吧  拜拜
<6-13,Sheldon>All right, good-bye.

203
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,660
<6-14,Leonard>等下
<6-14,Leonard>No, wait!

204
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,930
<6-14,Leonard>如果有人问你我去哪了  你就说不知道
<6-14,Leonard>If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.

205
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,930
<6-15,Sheldon>你要去哪
<6-15,Sheldon>Where ARE you going?

206
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,490
<6-16,Leonard>我不能告诉你
<6-16,Leonard>I can't tell you that.

207
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,990
<6-17,Sheldon>谁会问我
<6-17,Sheldon>Who would ask me?

208
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,160
<6-18,Leonard>那个我也不能说
<6-18,Leonard>I can't tell you that, either.

209
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,290
<6-19,Sheldon>你叫我进来通知我
<6-19,Sheldon>So you brought me in here to inform me

210
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,060
<6-19,Sheldon>你不能告诉我你去哪
<6-19,Sheldon>that you can't tell me where you're going

211
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,920
<6-19,Sheldon>也不能告诉我谁会问起你去哪儿
<6-19,Sheldon>and you can't tell me who might ask?

212
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,190
<6-20,Leonard>是的  是我考虑不周到
<6-20,Leonard>Yeah, I really didn't think this through.

213
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,560
<6-21,Sheldon>莱纳德  等下
<6-21,Sheldon>Leonard, a moment.

214
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,120
<6-22,Leonard>怎么了
<6-22,Leonard>What?

215
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,060
<6-23,Sheldon>如有人...当然  还不确定是谁
<6-23,Sheldon>If someone-- and of course, we don't know who this would be--

216
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,220
<6-23,Sheldon>问你去哪了  我该怎么回答
<6-23,Sheldon>does ask where you've gone, what should I say?

217
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,620
<6-24,Leonard>我不知道  就说我去办公室了
<6-24,Leonard>I don't know. Just tell 'em I went to the office.

218
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,560
<6-25,Sheldon>-你要去办公室  -不
<6-25,Sheldon>Are you going to the office? No.

219
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,560
<6-27,Sheldon>那我怎么能理直气壮地说
<6-27,Sheldon>Then how can I say it convincingly?

220
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,920
<6-28,Leonard>就说"莱纳德去办公室了"
<6-28,Leonard>Just say, "Leonard went to the office."

221
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,320
<6-29,Sheldon>好的  莱纳德去办公室了
<6-29,Sheldon>All right. Leonard went to the office.

222
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,290
<6-30,Leonard>那是...  不  不是这样
<6-30,Leonard>What is...? No, not like that!

223
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,720
<6-30,Leonard>就说"莱纳德去办公室了"
<6-30,Leonard>Just, "Leonard went to the office."

224
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,120
<6-31,Sheldon>你要只告诉我你要去办公室
<6-31,Sheldon>This would have worked out a lot better

225
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,220
<6-31,Sheldon>就好办多了
<6-31,Sheldon>if you'd just told me you were going to the office.

226
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,590
<6-32,Leonard>我要去办公室了
<6-32,Leonard>I'm going to the office.

227
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,390
<6-33,Sheldon>看到没  为什么我不信你
<6-33,Sheldon>See? Why don't I believe you?

<6-35,Howard>Okay.

230
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,920
<6-36,Sheldon>没人想知道他去哪了吗
<6-36,Sheldon>Doesn't anyone want to know where he's going?

231
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,260
<6-37,Penny>好的  他去哪了
<6-37,Penny>Okay, where is he going?

232
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,620
<6-38,Sheldon>莱纳德去办公室了
<6-38,Sheldon>Leonard is going to the office.

233
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,460
<7-1,Leonard>今天工作如何
<7-1,Leonard>So how was work today?

234

<10-11,Sheldon>Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are,

352
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,630
<10-11,Sheldon>就是想表明你已经亡故了
<10-11,Sheldon>for all intents and purposes, deceased.

353
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,870
<10-11,Sheldon>他打算 通过不与你说话  以及在你说话时
<10-11,Sheldon>He intends to act on this by not speaking to you,

354
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,340
<10-11,Sheldon>假装没听见来对你采取措施
<10-11,Sheldon>feigning an inability to hear you when you speak

355
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,240
<10-11,Sheldon>另外  还拒绝承认你的存在
<10-11,Sheldon>and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.

356
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,600
<10-12,Leonard>这也太荒谬了
<10-12,Leonard>That's just ridiculous.

357
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,240
<10-12,Leonard>你为何要配合他
<10-12,Leonard>Why are you cooperating with him?

358
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,240
<10-13,Sheldon>规则不是我定的  莱纳德
<10-13,Sheldon>I don't make the rules, Leonard.

359
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,900
<10-14,Leonard>霍华德  别这样  我不是有意为之的
<10-14,Leonard>Howard, come on. I didn't plan on this.

360
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,770
<10-14,Leonard>事情就这么自然而然的发生了
<10-14,Leonard>These things just happen.

361
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,470
<10-14,Leonard>通常不会发生在我身上  但还是发生了
<10-14,Leonard>Usually not to me, but they do happen.

362
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,470
<10-15,Howard>有没有人感到有一股冷风
<10-15,Howard>Did someone just feel a cold breeze?

363
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,400
<10-16,Sheldon>我想这个隐喻是对死亡的引伸
<10-16,Sheldon>I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor.

364
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,240
<10-16,Sheldon>那股冷风就是所谓的灵的外质
<10-16,Sheldon>The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue

365
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,840
<10-16,Sheldon>一个脱离肉体的游魂
<10-16,Sheldon>of a disembodied soul passing by.

366
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,870
<10-17,Raj>不管了  我要吃剩下的一个了
<10-17,Raj>You know, screw it. I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.

367
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,940
<10-18,Leonard (answering door)>你好  斯蒂芬妮
<10-18,Leonard (answering door)>Hey. Oh, hi, Steph.

368
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
<10-19,Steph>进来吧  来的不是时候吗
<10-19,Steph>Come on in. Is this a bad time?

369
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,340
<10-20,Leonard>对  不过我也看不出你什么时候来合适
<10-20,Leonard>Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so...

370
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,370
<10-21,Howard>如果她不是死人之妇的话就好了
<10-21,Howard>Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead to Me.

371
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,970
<10-22,Steph>你好  霍华德
<10-22,Steph>Hello, Howard.

372
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,500
<10-23,Howard>谢尔顿
<10-23,Howard>Sheldon?

373
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,800
<10-24,Sheldon>对不起  你违反了你的隐喻
<10-24,Sheldon>I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor

374
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,440
<10-24,Sheldon>承认了她的存在  我不玩了
<10-24,Sheldon>by acknowledging her existence. I'm out.

375
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,040
<10-25,Leonard>他不听我解释
<10-25,Leonard>He just won't listen to me.

376
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,900
<10-26,Steph>好吧  我想那就只有我们三个了
<10-26,Steph>Okay, I guess it'll just be the three of us then.

377
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,770
<10-27,Leonard>利萨会很失望的  是呀
<10-27,Leonard>Lisa's gonna be disappointed. Yeah.

378
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,700
<10-29,Howard>利萨
<10-29,Howard>Lisa?

379
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,270
<10-30,Steph>对  我室友
<10-30,Steph>Yeah, my roommate.

380
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,100
<10-30,Steph>她刚刚经历了一段糟糕的恋情
<10-30,Steph>She just went throh a really bad breakup

381
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,740
<10-30,Steph>我想她可能想见见像你这样识趣的人
<10-30,Steph>and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.

382
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,520
<10-31,Howard>莱纳德  斯蒂芬妮  你们又活过来了  这真是奇迹
<10-31,Howard>Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive! It's a miracle.

383
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,500
<11-1,Howard>利萨  不管怎样  我就想再说一次
<11-1,Howard>So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again

384
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,500
<11-1,Howard>我那晚过得很开心
<11-1,Howard>how much I enjoyed the other night,

385
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,240
<11-1,Howard>还有就是  这样结束了  我也很遗憾
<11-1,Howard>and again, I'm sorry for how it ended.

386
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,970
<11-1,Howard>不过  如果这周五的情况你能让我知道的话
<11-1,Howard>But again, if you could let me know about Friday.

387
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,670
<11-1,Howard>我妈要知道有多少人
<11-1,Howard>My mother needs a head count

388
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,600
<11-1,Howard>这样她就知道该买多大的胸肉了
<11-1,Howard>so she can know how big a brisket to get.

389
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,870
<11-2,Leonard>霍华德  霍华德  快看这个
<11-2,Leonard>Howard, Howard, look at this.

390
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,770
<11-3,Howard>记得回我话
<11-3,Howard>Anyway, call me.

391
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,900
<11-4,Voice from TV>科学家一直都在关注火星上是否存在生命  我是霍华德
<11-4,Voice from TV>The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists It's Howard.

392
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,340
<11-4,Voice from TV>看来其他人也在关注
<11-4,Voice from TV>and laypersons alike.

393
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,470
<11-4,Voice from TV>火星漫步者怎样进入裂缝还尚未得知
<11-4,Voice from TV>It's unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice,

394
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,170
<11-4,Voice from TV>但有一件事是确定的
<11-4,Voice from TV>but one thing's certain:

395
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,970
<11-4,Voice from TV>火星漫游者发送回来的数据
<11-4,Voice from TV>The data which it has sent back contain

396
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,340
<11-4,Voice from TV>第一次清楚地表明

397
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,640
<11-4,Voice from TV>火星上真有可能存在生命
<11-4,Voice from TV>that there may have been life on Mars.

<11-4,Voice from TV>这个科学发现 对全人类来说都有巨大的意义
<11-4,Voice from TV>It's a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind.

399
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,270
<11-4,Voice from TV>遗憾的是  我们永远也不会知道这归功于谁
<11-4,Voice from TV>Unfortunately, we'll never know who's responsible.

400
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,300
