5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,290
<1-4,Sheldon>没关联  我只是迫切想为

<1-4,Sheldon>to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,460
<1-5,Leonard>我的问题在于  我没有展现出自信
<1-5,Leonard>My problem is, I don't project confidence.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,080

<3-5,Leonard>You know, one of those guys

111
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,560
<3-5,Leonard>建筑监理师
<3-5,Leonard>who examines the building blocks of creation

112

<3-7,Leonard>Of course, most of my relationships are good.

121
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,170
<3-7,Leonard>也许是因为我浑身流露着自信
<3-7,Leonard>Probably because I exude confidence.

122
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,710
<3-7,Leonard>这点很吸引人的  你懂吗
<3-7,Leonard>People are drawn to that, you know?

123
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,450
<3-7,Leonard>我是说自信  不是流"露"
<3-7,Leonard>Confidence, not exuding.

129
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,480
<3-10,Page>听上去不错
<3-10,Page>Sounds great.

130
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,200
<3-11,Leonard>真的吗
<3-11,Leonard>Really?

131

133
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,460
<3-12,Page>那是
<3-12,Page>Is that...?

134
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,070
<3-13,Leonard>天啊  我摘了眼镜没看到你的戒指
<3-13,Leonard>Oh, my, I didn't see the ring with my glasses off, so...

135
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,120
<3-13,Leonard>瞧  这下我开始流"露"了
<3-13,Leonard>Look at that, I'm starting to exude.

136
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,020
<4-1,Leonard>你想去开门吗
<4-1,Leonard>Want to get that?

137
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,760
<4-2,Sheldon>不是很想
<4-2,Sheldon>Not particularly.

138
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,630
<4-3,Leonard>可以去开一下门吗
<4-3,Leonard>Could you get that?

139
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,390
<4-4,Sheldon>要是有人求我去的话  也可以去的
<4-4,Sheldon>I suppose I could if I were asked.

140
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,860
<4-5,Leonard>可不可以请你开一下门
<4-5,Leonard>Would you please get that?

141
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,080
<4-6,Sheldon>当然可以
<4-6,Sheldon>Of course.

142
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,020
<4-6,Sheldon>你干吗非要把事情弄得这么复杂呢
<4-6,Sheldon>Why do you have to make things so complicated?

143
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,680
<4-7,Page>库珀博士吗
<4-7,Page>Dr. Cooper?

144
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,460
<4-8,Sheldon>是的
<4-8,Sheldon>Yes.

145
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,240
<4-9,Page>我是联邦调查局探员蓓姬
<4-9,Page>I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

146
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,750
<4-10,Sheldon>你说你自己是

147
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,440

<4-9,Page>Special Agent Page, FBI.

148
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,290
<4-11,Page>这是我的证件
<4-11,Page>Here's my I.D.

149
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,690
<4-12,Sheldon>这是我正义联盟的会员卡
<4-12,Sheldon>And here is my Justice League membership card.

150
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,940
<4-12,Sheldon>但是这不能证明我认识蝙蝠侠
<4-12,Sheldon>But that doesn't prove I know Batman.

151
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,570
<4-13,Page>我只是想问你几个
<4-13,Page>I just want to ask you a few questions

152
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,520
<4-13,Page>关于霍华德·沃罗威茨的问题
<4-13,Page>about Howard Wolowitz.

153
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,080
<4-13,Page>好吧
<4-13,Page>Oh. All right.

154
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,790
<4-14,Sheldon>我想没人会冒着
<4-14,Sheldon>I doubt anyone would risk

155
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,700
<4-14,Sheldon>假扮联邦政府探员的重罪
<4-14,Sheldon>the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer

156
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,880
<4-14,Sheldon>来问几个关于一个患有强烈恋母情结
<4-14,Sheldon>just to ask questions about a minor league engineer

157
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,540
<4-14,Sheldon>的小工程师的问题
<4-14,Sheldon>with an unresolved oedipal complex.

158
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,730
<4-15,Page>谢谢
<4-15,Page>Thank you.

159
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,940
<4-16,Sheldon>老实说  我非常支持
<4-16,Sheldon>For the record, I truly support the FBI

160
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,730
<4-16,Sheldon>联邦调查局为完成使命
<4-16,Sheldon>in the mission which is expressed

161
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,330
<4-16,Sheldon>所立下的誓言
<4-16,Sheldon>through their motto...?

162
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,660
<4-17,Page>忠诚  勇敢  正直
<4-17,Page>Fidelity, bravery, and integrity.

163
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,540
<4-18,Sheldon>回答正确  说正事吧
<4-18,Sheldon>Correct. Now to business.

164
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,690
<4-18,Sheldon>十八年前有人在我的门廊上
<4-18,Sheldon>18 years ago, I sent the FBI crime lab samples

165
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,130
<4-18,Sheldon>点燃了一包粪便  我从中提取了样本
<4-18,Sheldon>from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire

166
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,480
<4-18,Sheldon>寄给了联调局的罪案鉴证科
<4-18,Sheldon>on my front porch...

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,180
<4-18,Sheldon>为了提取指纹和化验DNA
<4-18,Sheldon>...for fingerprinting and DNA analysis.

168
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,580
<4-18,Sheldon>为什么我到现在还没收到任何回复呢
<4-18,Sheldon>Why haven't I heard back yet?

169
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,660
<4-19,Page>联邦调查局的罪案鉴证科事务繁忙
<4-19,Page>Well, the FBI crime lab does have a lot on its plate.

170
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,410
<4-20,Sheldon>这对于一个想要把烧焦的粪便
<4-20,Sheldon>That's of little comfort to a nation

171
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,210
<4-20,Sheldon>从鞋上刮下来的人来说可不是个好消息
<4-20,Sheldon>attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.

172
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,660
<4-21,Page>你介不介意我们来谈一下沃罗威茨先生
<4-21,Page>Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?

173
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,020
<4-22,Sheldon>有点介意  不过说吧
<4-22,Sheldon>A little, but go on.

174
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,170
<4-22,Sheldon>谢谢
<4-22,Sheldon>Thank you.

175
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,510
<4-23,Page>你认为他是个负责任的人吗
<4-23,Page>Would you characterize him as responsible?

176
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,020
<4-24,Sheldon>我来举证回答你这个问题吧
<4-24,Sheldon>I'm going to answer that with a visual aid.

177
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,580
<4-24,Sheldon>这是我的《魔戒》三部曲
<4-24,Sheldon>This is my nine-disc complete

178
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,950
<4-24,Sheldon>九张蓝光碟版的完整收藏
<4-24,Sheldon>Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.

179
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,280
<4-24,Sheldon>沃罗威茨曾经借走过
<4-24,Sheldon>Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it,

180
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,090
<4-24,Sheldon>结果把第三张碟的塑料壳弄坏了
<4-24,Sheldon>damaged plastic retention hub number three...

181
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,140
<4-24,Sheldon>然后就这样还给我  还指望我不会发现
<4-24,Sheldon>...and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn't notice.

182
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,930
<4-24,Sheldon>你觉得这叫做负责任吗
<4-24,Sheldon>Would you characterize that as responsible?

183
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,560
<4-25,Page>我们对这类事情不感兴趣
<4-25,Page>That's really not the sort of thing we're interested in.

184
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,430
<4-26,Sheldon>你听到我说这是蓝光了吧
<4-26,Sheldon>You heard me say blu-ray, right?

185
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,310
<4-27,Page>听到了
<4-27,Page>I did.

186
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,310
<4-28,Sheldon>很好
<4-28,Sheldon>Very well.

187
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,750
<4-28,Sheldon>那你想不想知道
<4-28,Sheldon>Would you be interested

188
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,220
<4-28,Sheldon>沃罗威茨先生曾经偷偷登录我的
<4-28,Sheldon>in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto

189
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,180
<4-28,Sheldon>魔兽争霸账号  然后把我一个八十级的
<4-28,Sheldon>my World of Warcraft account and changed the name

190
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,060
<4-28,Sheldon>术士名字由谢耳朵改成了没耳朵
<4-28,Sheldon>of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?

191
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,030
<4-29,Page>这个也不感兴趣
<4-29,Page>I'm afraid not.

192
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,710
<4-29,Page>还有别的吗
<4-29,Page>Is there anything else?

193
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,740
<4-29,Page>"还有别的吗"
<4-29,Page>"Is there anything else"?

194
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,020
<4-30,Sheldon>你想从哪里开始说起
<4-30,Sheldon>Where would you like to start?

195
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,760
<4-30,Sheldon>我借给他的书
<4-30,Sheldon>He refuses to pay fines

196
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
<4-30,Sheldon>他延期不还  还拒绝缴纳罚款
<4-30,Sheldon>when he's overdue with books I lend him.

197
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,190
<4-31,Page>他为了泡妞
<4-31,Page>He crashed the Mars Rover

198
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,930
<4-30,Sheldon>而撞毁了火星探测器
<4-30,Sheldon>while attempting to impress a woman.

199
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,360
<4-30,Sheldon>他推荐我去看
<4-30,Sheldon>He recommended that I go see

200
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,070
<4-30,Sheldon>黑客帝国三  因为  他的原话是
<4-30,Sheldon>the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote,

201
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,950
<4-30,Sheldon>"这部跟第一部一样精彩"
<4-30,Sheldon>"just as good as the first one".

202
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,130
<4-30,Sheldon>我不知道还有谁比他更不负责任的了
<4-30,Sheldon>If that's not irresponsible, I don't know what is.

203
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,450
<4-31,Page>火星探测器
<4-31,Page>The Mars Rover?

204
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,530
<4-32,Sheldon>我有说火星探测器吗
<4-32,Sheldon>Did I say Mars Rover?

205
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,990
<4-33,Page>说了
<4-33,Page>You did.

206
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,640
<4-34,Sheldon>这个例子其实举得很烂
<4-34,Sheldon>That was actually a poorly chosen example,

207
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,320
<4-34,Sheldon>因为那跟我一点关系也没有
<4-34,Sheldon>as it had nothing to do with me.

208
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,920
<4-35,Page>没关系  我们还是来谈一下吧
<4-35,Page>Yes, well, let's talk about it anyway.

209
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,830
<4-1,Leonard>我不想谈
<4-1,Leonard>I don't want to.

210
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,780
<4-36,Sheldon>但是我不愿意谈这件事
<4-36,Sheldon>Not that my disinclination

211
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,160
<4-36,Sheldon>并不能证明
<4-36,Sheldon>to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of

212
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,290
<4-36,Sheldon>是霍华德·沃罗威茨损坏了
<4-36,Sheldon>Howard Wolowitz's culpability in the destruction

213
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,410
<4-36,Sheldon>上千万美元的政府财产
<4-36,Sheldon>of government property worth millions of dollars.

214
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,840
<4-37,Page>谢谢你  库珀博士
<4-37,Page>Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

215
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
<4-37,Page>我想我已经问完了
<4-37,Page>I think I have all I need.

216
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,310
<4-38,Sheldon>太好了
<4-38,Sheldon>Oh, good.

217
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,910
<4-38,Sheldon>我还怕你会
<4-38,Sheldon>I was afraid you were going to fixate

218
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,100
<4-38,Sheldon>抓着火星探测器那件事不放呢
<4-38,Sheldon>on that Mars Rover incident.

219
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,490
<5-1,Howard>伙计们
<5-1,Howard>Hey, buddies.

220
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,070
<5-1,Howard>猜猜谁由于没通过安全审查
<5-1,Howard>Guess who didn't get security clearance

221
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,010
<5-1,Howard>所以不能参与太空激光器的工作了
<5-1,Howard>to work on the giant space laser?

222
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,830
<5-2,Leonard>怎么搞的
<5-2,Leonard>What happened?

223
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,120
<5-3,Howard>显然  有人在背景调查时说我坏话了呗
<5-3,Howard>Apparently, the background interviews didn't go well.

224
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,710
<5-3,Howard>这肯定跟你们几个没关系 对吧
<5-3,Howard>You guys wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

225
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,770
<5-4,Raj>实际上  我跟那个女探员谈话的时候
<5-4,Raj>Well, actually, I may have gotten

226
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,210
<5-4,Raj>可能有点喝醉了
<5-4,Raj>a little tipsy when I talked to her.

227
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,590
<5-5,Leonard>我可能有点想要泡她的意思
<5-5,Leonard>And I may have hit on her a little bit.

228
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,090
<5-6,Raj>我可能把朗姆蛋糕扔到她鞋上了
<5-6,Raj>I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.

229
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,720
<5-6,Raj>我知道了
<5-6,Raj>I see.

230
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,050
<5-7,Howard>很好  每当我需要你们的时候
<5-7,Howard>Well, it's good to know, when I need you guys,

231
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,850
<5-7,Howard>我总能指望你们跳出来把事情搞砸的
<5-7,Howard>I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.

232
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,410
<5-8,Leonard>我好内疚
<5-8,Leonard>I feel awful.

233
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,850
<5-9,Raj>我也是
<5-9,Raj>Ah, me, too.

234
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,450
<5-10,Leonard>老实说  就算有人会搞砸
<5-10,Leonard>To tell you the truth,

235
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,350
<5-10,Leonard>霍华德的安全审核
<5-10,Leonard>I thought if anyone was going to

236
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,430
<5-10,Leonard>我也觉得应该是谢尔顿的错
<5-10,Leonard>screw things up for Howard, it'd be Sheldon.

237
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,530
<5-11,Sheldon>显然你的预期被推翻了
<5-11,Sheldon>Well, your expectations have been subverted.

238
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,570
<5-11,Sheldon>啊哈
<5-11,Sheldon>Aha.

239
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,700
<6-1,Leonard>你怎么还不睡
<6-1,Leonard>What are you doing up?

240
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,680
<6-2,Sheldon>睡眠弃我而去了  莱纳德
<6-2,Sheldon>Sleep eludes me, Leonard.

241
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,130
<6-2,Sheldon>是么
<6-2,Sheldon>Really?

242
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,750
<6-3,Leonard>可能你之前遇见过他  却错过了
<6-3,Leonard>Maybe sleep has met you before.

243
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,260
<6-4,Sheldon>这算是讽刺么
<6-4,Sheldon>Mockery?

244
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,890
<6-4,Sheldon>你就不能说些别的吗
<6-4,Sheldon>That's all you have to offer?

245
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,440
<6-5,Leonard>不好意思  你为什么睡不着
<6-5,Leonard>I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?

246
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,610
<6-6,Sheldon>谁知道呢
<6-6,Sheldon>Who knows?

247
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,360
<6-6,Sheldon>我最近又没看什么惊悚片
<6-6,Sheldon>I haven't watched any scary movies recently.

248
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,880
<6-6,Sheldon>也不再纠结为什么
<6-6,Sheldon>I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass

249
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,930
<6-6,Sheldon>量子真空质量的预测
<6-6,Sheldon>of the quantum vacuum has little effect

250
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,850
<6-6,Sheldon>对宇宙膨胀作用甚微
<6-6,Sheldon>on the expansion of the universe.

251
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,300
<6-6,Sheldon>我不小心喝了一小口红牛也是好几周前的事了
<6-6,Sheldon>And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.

252
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,230
<6-7,Leonard>那今天发生了什么事让你纠结
<6-7,Leonard>Did something happen today that's bothering you?

253
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,180
<6-8,Sheldon>我的确是对联调局探员
<6-8,Sheldon>Well, I did mention

254
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,100
<6-8,Sheldon>提到了火星探测器那件事
<6-8,Sheldon>the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent

255
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,730
<6-8,Sheldon>也许这害得霍华德没通过安全审核
<6-8,Sheldon>and probably cost Howard his security clearance.

256
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,310
<6-10,Sheldon>-啥  -但我为什么睡不着呢
<6-10,Sheldon>- What? - But why should that keep me up?

257
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,610
<6-11,Leonard>因为你感到愧疚么
<6-11,Leonard>Because you feel guilty?

258
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,270
<6-12,Sheldon>有意思
<6-12,Sheldon>Interesting.

259
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,560
<6-12,Sheldon>你是说我失眠是因为愧疚感作祟
<6-12,Sheldon>So you're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.

260
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,410
<6-13,Leonard>其实你没有失眠
<6-13,Leonard>Actually, you don't have insomnia.

261
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,640
<6-13,Leonard>你正在睡觉
<6-13,Leonard>You're sleeping now.

262
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,840
<6-14,Sheldon>你说啥
<6-14,Sheldon>Excuse me?

263
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,770
<6-15,Leonard>你正在一个因内疚感而生的梦境里
<6-15,Leonard>You're having a guilt-ridden dream.

264
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,560
<6-16,Sheldon>你这么说有什么证据吗
<6-16,Sheldon>Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?

265
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,250
<6-17,Leonard>看到沙发上那个戈恩人了吗[星际迷航]
<6-17,Leonard>How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?

266
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,030
<6-18,Sheldon>好吧  很有说服力
<6-18,Sheldon>That seems fairly conclusive.

267
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,280
<6-18,Sheldon>不  戈恩
<6-18,Sheldon>No, Gorn, no.

268
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,600
<6-18,Sheldon>那是我的位子
<6-18,Sheldon>That's where I sit.

269
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,660
<7-1,Sheldon>多谢你同意见我  蓓姬探员
<7-1,Sheldon>Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.

270
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,490
<7-2,Page>多谢你向我上级投诉我  库珀博士
<7-2,Page>Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper.

271
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,880
<7-2,Page>我明白你想要撤销
<7-2,Page>I understand you want to recant

272
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,930
<7-2,Page>你对霍华德·沃罗威茨的说辞
<7-2,Page>your statement about Howard Wolowitz.

273
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,220
<7-4,Page>-没错  -你的说辞是假的吗
<7-4,Page>- Yes. - Was your statement untrue?

274
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,650
<7-5,Sheldon>是真的
<7-5,Sheldon>No.

275
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,570
<7-6,Page>那我恐怕你没法撤销
<7-6,Page>Then I'm afraid you can't withdraw it.

276
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,720
<7-7,Sheldon>不好意思  你可没说"不得回传"
<7-7,Sheldon>I'm sorry. I don't recall you saying "No backsies."

277
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,330
<7-8,Page>还有其它事吗
<7-8,Page>Is there anything else?

278
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,310
<7-9,Sheldon>有  我想发表一番对霍华德
<7-9,Sheldon>Yes. I'd like to offer a laudatory statement

279
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,620
<7-9,Sheldon>许多优秀品质的赞美
<7-9,Sheldon>about Howard's many excellent qualities that I believe

280
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,160
<7-9,Sheldon>我相信这能扭转局势
<7-9,Sheldon>will tip the scales back in his favor.

281
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,090
<7-11,Sheldon>霍华德·约尔·沃罗威茨
<7-11,Sheldon>"Howard Joel Wolowitz.

282
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,500
<7-8,Page>H代表诚实  他的确相当诚实
<7-8,Page>"H is for honesty, of which he has much.

283
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,120
<7-9,Sheldon>O代表杰出
<7-9,Sheldon>"O's for outstanding,

284
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,380
<7-9,Sheldon>他也正是如此
<7-9,Sheldon>"Which he is such.

285
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,040
<7-9,Sheldon>W代表风趣  他的确很会讲笑话
<7-9,Sheldon>"W's for witty, he's quick with a joke.

286
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,170
<7-9,Sheldon>-A代表艺术才华  他可以...  -我很抱歉
<7-9,Sheldon>- A's for artistic, his ability..." - I'm sorry.

287
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,180
<7-10,Page>库珀博士  这没得谈了
<7-10,Page>Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.

288
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,610
<7-11,Sheldon>但名字的剩余部分我还没说完呢
<7-11,Sheldon>But I still have "rd Joel Wolowitz" Left to go.

289
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,470
<7-12,Page>这事儿已经完结了
<7-12,Page>It's closed.

290
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,150
<7-13,Sheldon>我真搞不懂你们这帮人
<7-13,Sheldon>I don't understand why you people

291
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,660
<7-13,Sheldon>要找我朋友霍华德的茬
<7-13,Sheldon>are picking on my friend, Howard,

292
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,240
<7-13,Sheldon>这个国家还面临着其它更严重的威胁
<7-13,Sheldon>when there are much more serious security threats to pursue.

293
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,340
<7-13,Sheldon>比如  我最初遇到莱纳德的时候
<7-13,Sheldon>For instance, when I first met Leonard,

294
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,700
<7-13,Sheldon>他就差点把导弹机密
<7-13,Sheldon>he was on the verge of giving away

295
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,850
<7-13,Sheldon>透露给一个朝鲜间谍
<7-13,Sheldon>rocket secrets to a North Korean spy,

296
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,020
<7-13,Sheldon>但却没有一个探员去调查这事
<7-13,Sheldon>and not one agent ever investigated that.

297
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,030
<7-14,Page>你是指莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德吗
<7-14,Page>This is Leonard Hofstadter?

298
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,090
<7-15,Sheldon>不  是另一个叫莱纳德的
<7-15,Sheldon>No, it's a different Leonard.

299
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,420
<7-15,Sheldon>他...
<7-15,Sheldon>He's...

300
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,040
<7-15,Sheldon>他是中国人  红头发  六根手指  再见
<7-15,Sheldon>Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.

301
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,010
<8-1,Sheldon>拉杰
<8-1,Sheldon>Raj.

302
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,470
<8-1,Sheldon>你看到霍华德了吗
<8-1,Sheldon>Have you seen Howard?

303
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,310
<8-2,Raj>我想他在吃饭吧
<8-2,Raj>I think he's eating lunch.

304
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,970
<8-2,Raj>谢尔顿  这位是尼尔·德格拉斯·泰森
<8-2,Raj>Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil DeGrasse Tyson

305
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,120
<8-2,Raj>纽约海登天文馆馆长
<8-2,Raj>from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.

306
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,400
<8-3,Sheldon>我和泰森博士挺熟呢
<8-3,Sheldon>I'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson.

307
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,690
<8-3,Sheldon>都归功于他的一家之言
<8-3,Sheldon>He's responsible for the demotion of Pluto

308
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,370
<8-3,Sheldon>冥王星不再是行星了
<8-3,Sheldon>from planetary status.

309
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,960
<8-3,Sheldon>我喜欢冥王星
<8-3,Sheldon>I liked Pluto.

310
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,310
<8-3,Sheldon>所以我不喜欢你
<8-3,Sheldon>Ergo I do not like you.

311
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,360
<8-4,Dr Tyson>其实不是我的一家之言
<8-4,Dr Tyson>But I actually didn't demote Pluto.

312
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,030
<8-4,Dr Tyson>而是国际天文联合会投票决定的
<8-4,Dr Tyson>That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.

313
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,190
<8-5,Sheldon>要是总拿"如果"和"但是"来糊弄我们
<8-5,Sheldon>If "Ifs" And "Buts" Were candy and nuts,

314
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,680
<8-5,Sheldon>圣诞节可不会开心的是吧
<8-5,Sheldon>we'd all have a merry Christmas.

315
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,970
<8-5,Sheldon>好好想想吧  泰森博士
<8-5,Sheldon>Think about that, Dr. Tyson.

316
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,990
<8-6,Dr Tyson>你和我说的就是他吗
<8-6,Dr Tyson>Is that the guy you were telling me about?

317
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,990
<8-7,Raj>没错
<8-7,Raj>Oh, yeah.

318
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,320
<8-7,Raj>霍华德
<8-7,Raj>Howard.

319
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,830
<9-1,Sheldon>害你没通过安全审核的人是我
<9-1,Sheldon>The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.

320
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,700
<9-2,Howard>是你
<9-2,Howard>You?

321
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,830
<9-3,Sheldon>对  在你发飙之前  我要告诉你
<9-3,Sheldon>Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know

322
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,310
<9-3,Sheldon>我去找了联调局的人撤回我的说辞
<9-3,Sheldon>I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.

323
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,430
<9-4,Howard>他们同意了吗
<9-4,Howard>And they were okay with that?

324
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,050
<9-5,Sheldon>不  那啥  反而更糟了
<9-5,Sheldon>No. If anything, I made it worse.

325
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,440
<9-5,Sheldon>不管怎样  我充满了罪恶感
<9-5,Sheldon>In any case, I have been riddled with guilt,

326
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,070
<9-5,Sheldon>搞得戈恩人都跑进了我梦里
<9-5,Sheldon>which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep.

327
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,660
<9-5,Sheldon>所以我来对你说抱歉
<9-5,Sheldon>So, I'm here now to say I'm sorry.

328
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,610
<9-6,Howard>你开什么玩笑
<9-6,Howard>Are you kidding me?

329
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,160
<9-6,Howard>你害得我的职业发展倒退了至少两年
<9-6,Howard>You've set my career back at least two years,

330
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,250
<9-6,Howard>你觉得说句抱歉就能算了吗
<9-6,Howard>and you think you can make it right with "I'm sorry"?

331
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,910
<9-6,Howard>是的
<9-6,Howard>Yes.

332
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,600
<9-7,Sheldon>我遵循了社交礼仪
<9-7,Sheldon>I followed the social protocol.

333
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,380
<9-7,Sheldon>曾努力想要纠正错误  但我失败了
<9-7,Sheldon>I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so,

334
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,100
<9-7,Sheldon>所以我表示诚挚的抱歉
<9-7,Sheldon>I delivered a heartfelt apology.

335
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,150
<9-7,Sheldon>现在你得说
<9-7,Sheldon>Now you say,

336
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,280
<9-7,Sheldon>"我接受你的道歉"
<9-7,Sheldon>"Apology accepted,"

337
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,030
<9-7,Sheldon>而我和你击下掌  仅此一次
<9-7,Sheldon>and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.

338
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,990
<9-8,Howard>我不接受你的道歉
<9-8,Howard>Your apology is not accepted.

339
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,740
<9-9,Sheldon>你开玩笑吧
<9-9,Sheldon>You're tricking me.

340
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,360
<9-9,Sheldon>其实你接受了吧
<9-9,Sheldon>It really is, isn't it?

341
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,710
<9-10,Howard>别烦我  谢尔顿
<9-10,Howard>Leave me alone, Sheldon.

342
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,910
<9-11,Dr Tyson>库珀博士  我想告诉你
<9-11,Dr Tyson>Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know

343
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,310
<9-11,Dr Tyson>我很抱歉我对冥王星的所作所为
<9-11,Dr Tyson>I'm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.

344
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,280
<9-12,Sheldon>闭嘴
<9-12,Sheldon>Oh, shut up.

345
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,970
<10-1,Penny>谢尔顿
<10-1,Penny>Sheldon?

346

<10-2,Sheldon>你好

347
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,540
<10-3,Penny>你怎么会在这
<10-3,Penny>What are you doing here?

<10-4,Sheldon>我有麻烦了  佩妮
<10-4,Sheldon>I have troubles, Penny.

349
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,070
<10-4,Sheldon>我想来找充满同情心的

350
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,980
<10-4,Sheldon>当地酒吧酒保一吐心事
<10-4,Sheldon>to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.

351
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,350
<10-5,Penny>其实橄榄园那边就有个不错的酒吧
<10-5,Penny>You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.

352
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,710
<10-6,Sheldon>我不喜欢橄榄园
<10-6,Sheldon>I don't like the Olive Garden.

353
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,150
<10-6,Sheldon>他们对我跟家人似的
<10-6,Sheldon>They treat me like family.

354
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,590
<10-7,Penny>-好吧谢尔顿  想喝点什么  -酒
<10-7,Penny>- Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?  - Alcohol.

355
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,410
<10-9,Penny>能再具体点吗
<10-9,Penny>Could you be a little more specific?

356
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,850
<10-10,Sheldon>乙醇
<10-10,Sheldon>Ethyl alcohol.

357
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,750
<10-13,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila)>40毫升
<10-13,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila)>40 milliliters.

358
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,680
<10-11,Penny>抱歉亲爱的  我不懂毫升制
<10-11,Penny>I'm sorry, honey. I don't know milliliters.

359
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,190
<10-12,Sheldon>那得怪詹姆斯·吉米·卡特总统
<10-12,Sheldon>Ah. Blame President James "Jimmy" Carter.

360
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,790
<10-12,Sheldon>他让美国开始实行公制体系
<10-12,Sheldon>He started America on a path to the metric system

361
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,640
<10-12,Sheldon>却又半途而废
<10-12,Sheldon>but then just gave up.

362
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,230
<10-12,Sheldon>他还想不明白自己为何不能连任总统
<10-12,Sheldon>He wonders why he was a one-term president.

363
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,100
<10-13,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila)>你说这里差不多是40毫升吧
<10-13,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila)>Would you say that's about 40 milliliters?

364
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,160
<10-14,Sheldon>-差不多  -很好
<10-14,Sheldon>- More or less.  - Great.

365
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,460
<10-15,Penny>咱说到哪了
<10-15,Penny>Now, where were we?

366
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,330
<10-16,Sheldon>相信你马上就要让我点一种鸡尾酒了
<10-16,Sheldon>I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail.

367
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,680
<10-16,Sheldon>幸好  拜嗜酒的电脑通们所赐
<10-16,Sheldon>Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics,

368
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,820
<10-16,Sheldon>正好有开发这应用
<10-16,Sheldon>there's an app for that.

369
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,830
<10-16,Sheldon>看看
<10-16,Sheldon>Let's see.

370
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,970
<10-16,Sheldon>哈维撞墙  算了
<10-16,Sheldon>Harvey Wallbanger. Eh.

371
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,270
<10-16,Sheldon>海滩性爱  我可不要
<10-16,Sheldon>Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so.

372
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,890
<10-16,Sheldon>罗布罗伊  丝绸拖鞋  疯狂鞋匠
<10-16,Sheldon>Rob Roy, silk Slipper, Mad Hatter.

373
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,530
<10-19,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila)>给我来一杯玫瑰花水里奇
<10-19,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila)>I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.

374
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,220
<10-18,Sheldon>-什么酒  -需用到去核酒酿的樱桃  琴酒
<10-18,Sheldon>- A what? - You'll need pitted,brandied cherries, gin,

375
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,850
<10-18,Sheldon>玫瑰花水  安古斯图拉苦味酒和高度朗姆酒
<10-18,Sheldon>rosewater, Angostura Bitters and overproofed rum.

376
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,330
<10-18,Sheldon>首先  在樱桃上撒上糖
<10-18,Sheldon>Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar,

377
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,110
<10-18,Sheldon>然后喷上朗姆和苦味酒
<10-18,Sheldon>then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters.

378
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,490
<10-18,Sheldon>再点燃朗姆酒  将饴糖...
<10-18,Sheldon>Then ignite the rum, caramel...

379
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,510
<10-19,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila)>给你  你的玫瑰花水里奇
<10-19,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila)>Here you go -- one Rosewater Ricky.

380
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,600
<10-20,Sheldon>跟照片上的不像
<10-20,Sheldon>That's not how it looks in the picture.

381
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,970
<10-21,Penny>是啊  不过每位酒保调法都稍有差异
<10-21,Penny>Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently.

382
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,760
<10-21,Penny>何不试试再说
<10-21,Penny>Why don't you give it a try.

383
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,810
<10-21,Penny>好吧
<10-21,Penny>All right.

384
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,560
<10-22,Sheldon>敬公制体系
<10-22,Sheldon>To the metric system.

385
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,170
<10-22,Sheldon>我没尝到有樱桃味
<10-22,Sheldon>I can't taste the cherries.

386
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,350
<10-23,Penny>好吧  谢尔顿  你到底在烦恼什么
<10-23,Penny>All right. Sheldon, what's on your mind?

387
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,570
<10-24,Sheldon>我对不起霍华德  他不接受我的道歉
<10-24,Sheldon>I wronged Howard, and he won't accept my apology.

388
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,730
<10-25,Penny>哦那件事啊
<10-25,Penny>Oh, right, that.

389
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,350
<10-25,Penny>莱纳德跟我说了  很遗憾亲爱的
<10-25,Penny>Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.

390
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:45,060
<10-26,Sheldon>佩妮  你每天都面对着失败
<10-26,Sheldon>Penny, you face failure on a daily basis.

391
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,440
<10-26,Sheldon>你是怎么处理的
<10-26,Sheldon>How do you cope?

392
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,920
<10-27,Penny>我喝酒啊
<10-27,Penny>I drink.

393
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,640
<10-28,Sheldon>敬喝酒
<10-28,Sheldon>To drinking.

394
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,990
<10-28,Sheldon>不行
<10-28,Sheldon>Nope.

395
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,190
<10-28,Sheldon>真希望有什么能强迫霍华德接受我的道歉
<10-28,Sheldon>If only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology

396
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,130
<10-28,Sheldon>让我逃脱这内疚的深渊
<10-28,Sheldon>so I could escape this miasma of guilt.

397
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,020
<10-29,Penny>有些事它注定要发生
<10-29,Penny>You know, sometimes stuff just happens,

398
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,550
<10-29,Penny>你是无能为力的
<10-29,Penny>and there's nothing you can do about it.

399
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,520
<10-29,Penny>比如  丽莎·皮特森从高二就不跟我讲话
<10-29,Penny>Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade,

400
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,300
<10-29,Penny>因为不管怎么道歉
<10-29,Penny>because no matter how much you apologize,

401
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,400
<10-29,Penny>都改变不了勾走她男友的事实
<10-29,Penny>you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.

402
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,320
<10-29,Penny>我明白了
<10-29,Penny>I see.

403
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,430
<10-30,Sheldon>你是说我面对的是星舰学院
<10-30,Sheldon>You're saying I'm facing Starfleet Academy's

404
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,240
<10-30,Sheldon>不可能完成的测试  小林丸号测验
<10-30,Sheldon>unwinnable command scenario: the Kobayashi Maru.

405
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,090
<10-31,Penny>没错
<10-31,Penny>Exactly.

406
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,460
<10-31,Penny>有时候注定你赢不了
<10-31,Penny>Sometimes you can't win.

407
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,620
<10-32,Sheldon>柯克船长就赢了
<10-32,Sheldon>Captain Kirk won.

408
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,870
<10-33,Penny>柯克作弊了
<10-33,Penny>Kirk cheated.

409
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,520
<10-34,Sheldon>真不敢相信你知道这个
<10-34,Sheldon>Impressive that you know that.

410
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,960
<10-34,Sheldon>难以置信我竟然跟你在讨论这些
<10-34,Sheldon>It's hard to believe i'm actually having this conversation with you.

411
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,890
<10-35,Penny>佩妮与你同在
<10-35,Penny>Right there with you.

412
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,750
<10-36,Sheldon>柯克通过改编测试程序  通过了该测试
<10-36,Sheldon>Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator.

413
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,530
<10-37,Penny>-就这么办  -什么
<10-37,Penny>- That's it. - What?

414
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,290
<10-38,Sheldon>-我要改编霍华德  -什么
<10-38,Sheldon>- I'll reprogram Howard. - What...?

415
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,540
<10-39,Penny>谢尔顿  人是没法改编的
<10-39,Penny>Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.

416
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,120
<10-40,Sheldon>不  是你不能改编而已
<10-40,Sheldon>No, you can't reprogram people.

417
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,240
<10-40,Sheldon>敬詹姆斯·T·柯克船长
<10-40,Sheldon>To James Tiberius Kirk.

418
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,020
<11-1,Sheldon>各位好
<11-1,Sheldon>Hello, all.

419
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,990
<11-4,Sheldon>霍华德  今天没那么生我气了  是吗
<11-4,Sheldon>Howard, you're feeling better about me today, aren't you?

420
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,720
<11-5,Howard>不是
<11-5,Howard>Not really.

421
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,490
<11-6,Sheldon>一定是的
<11-6,Sheldon>Yes, you are.

422
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,560
<11-6,Sheldon>我正用神经语言学规划法
<11-6,Sheldon>I'm using neurolinguistic programming

423
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,030
<11-6,Sheldon>修正你的思考模式
<11-6,Sheldon>to modify your thought patterns.

424
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,860
<11-7,Howard>滚远点  谢尔顿
<11-7,Howard>Go away, Sheldon.

425
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,550
<11-8,Sheldon>将近10美元买的那电子书就这么废掉了
<11-8,Sheldon>There's a $9.95 e-book down the drain.

426
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,630
<11-9,Raj>那袋子里是什么
<11-9,Raj>What's in the bag?

427
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,060
<11-10,Sheldon>是给霍华德的
<11-10,Sheldon>It's for Howard.

428
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,510
<11-11,Howard>谢尔顿  这事不是送个礼就能算了的
<11-11,Howard>Oh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.

429
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,080
<11-12,Sheldon>不管怎么说  我伤害了你
<11-12,Sheldon>Nevertheless, I've hurt you,

430
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,810
<11-12,Sheldon>不管你原不原谅我  我都要给你这个
<11-12,Sheldon>and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.

431
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,530
<11-13,Howard>你送我个沙发垫
<11-13,Howard>You're giving me a couch cushion?

432
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,040
<11-13,Howard>不是
<11-13,Howard>No.

433
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,810
<11-14,Sheldon>垫子只是象征性的
<11-14,Sheldon>The cushion is merely symbolic.

434
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,190
<11-14,Sheldon>我送你的是我沙发上的专座
<11-14,Sheldon>I'm giving you my spot on the couch.

435
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,740
<11-15,Howard>但你很爱那专座的
<11-15,Howard>But you love that spot.

436
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,360
<11-16,Sheldon>不  我很爱我妈妈
<11-16,Sheldon>No. I love my mother.

437
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,760
<11-16,Sheldon>而我对我专座的感情  要强烈得多
<11-16,Sheldon>My feelings for my spot are much greater.

438
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,190
<11-16,Sheldon>它是宇宙中独一无二属于我的
<11-16,Sheldon>It is the singular location in space

439
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,110
<11-16,Sheldon>环绕着它  是属于我的整个宇宙
<11-16,Sheldon>around which revolves my entire universe.

440
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,440
<11-16,Sheldon>现在它是你的了
<11-16,Sheldon>And now it's yours.

441
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,290
<11-17,Raj>天哪兄弟  你一定要原谅他
<11-17,Raj>Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.

442
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,770
<11-18,Howard>好吧
<11-18,Howard>All right.

443
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,400
<11-18,Howard>我接受你的道歉
<11-18,Howard>Apology accepted.

444
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
<11-19,Sheldon>击掌
<11-19,Sheldon>High five.

445
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,830
<11-19,Sheldon>别太用力
<11-19,Sheldon>Not too hard.

446
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,890
<11-19,Sheldon>谢谢
<11-19,Sheldon>Thank you.

447
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,610
<11-20,Raj>自《玩具总动员3》之后  我就没这么哭过了
<11-20,Raj>I haven't cried like this since Toy Story 3.

448
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,020
<12-1,Howard>不得不承认
<12-1,Howard>I got to tell you, Sheldon,

449
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,220
<12-1,Howard>谢尔顿  我总算明白你为何选这个专座了
<12-1,Howard>I understand why you chose this spot.

450
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,280
<12-1,Howard>温度正好  也没什么风
<12-1,Howard>I mean, the temperature is good, but there's no draft.

451
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,570
<12-1,Howard>能观赏电视  同时还能聊天...
<12-1,Howard>I can see the television, but I can still talk to...

452
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,700
<12-2,Sheldon>我改主意了  滚出我的专座
<12-2,Sheldon>I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.

453
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,830
<12-3,Penny>多久
<12-3,Penny>How long?

454
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,740
<12-4,Leonard>94秒
<12-4,Leonard>94 seconds.
