1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,700
<1-1,Sheldon>通往地下城的入口是一道布满苔藓的大门
<1-1,Sheldon>"The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,170
<1-1,Sheldon>你设法打开门  结果发现自己
<1-1,Sheldon>"You manage to open it only to find yourself

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,900
<1-1,Sheldon>面对着一个丑陋恶臭
<1-1,Sheldon>"Face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,080
<1-1,Sheldon>布满苔藓的食人魔
<1-1,Sheldon>moss-covered ogre."

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
<1-1,Sheldon>你该怎么做
<1-1,Sheldon>What do you do?

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,230
<1-2,Howard>我会跟他说"老妈  今晚吃点啥呢"
<1-2,Howard>I say, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?"

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,970
<1-3,Sheldon>十七点
<1-3,Sheldon>Seventeen.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,380
<1-3,Sheldon>食人魔被你的玩笑打动  允许你进入了
<1-3,Sheldon>The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,690
<1-3,Sheldon>顺便说一句  我也喜欢
<1-3,Sheldon>By the by, I liked it, too.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,640
<1-4,Leonard>婚礼筹备得如何了  霍华德
<1-4,Leonard>How go the wedding plans, Howard?

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,260
<1-5,Howard>很好啊  我们昨晚花了五小时
<1-5,Howard>Great. We spent five hours last night

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,490
<1-5,Howard>在梅西百货挑选礼物
<1-5,Howard>at Macy's registering for gifts.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,440
<1-5,Howard>看上去我终于能够品尝到
<1-5,Howard>Looks like I'm finally going to have

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,080
<1-5,Howard>我那梦寐以求的小巧可爱的陶盘芦笋菜肴了
<1-5,Howard>that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I've always wanted.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,240
<1-6,Leonard>看吧  这就是
<1-6,Leonard>See, this is the good thing

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,660
<1-6,Leonard>女友远在天边的好处了
<1-6,Leonard>about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,370
<1-6,Leonard>我起码可以在晚上为所欲为
<1-6,Leonard>I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,080
<1-7,Howard>你指的是跟我们玩完书呆子游戏后
<1-7,Howard>You mean like playing nerd games with us

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,880
<1-7,Howard>再去冲个可疑的长时间热水澡吗
<1-7,Howard>and then taking a suspiciously long shower?

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,580
<1-8,Leonard>也许吧
<1-8,Leonard>Maybe.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,620
<1-8,Leonard>我们进入了地下城
<1-8,Leonard>We enter the dungeon.

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,580
<1-9,Sheldon>看见了一条龙
<1-9,Sheldon>You see a dragon.

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,720
<1-10,Howard>不是吧  我们玩的这叫《龙与地下城》
<1-10,Howard>Really? So we're playing Dungeons & Dragons

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,400
<1-10,Howard>然后进入地下城就看见一条龙
<1-10,Howard>and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon?

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,740
<1-10,Howard>不觉得有点太直接了吗
<1-10,Howard>Isn't that a little on the nose?

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,100
<1-11,Sheldon>当你玩梯子滑道游戏时  你抱怨过
<1-11,Sheldon>When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,670
<1-11,Sheldon>所有的滑道和梯子吗
<1-11,Sheldon>about all the chutes and all the ladders?

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,990
<1-12,Leonard>你要把整个馅饼都吃了吗
<1-12,Leonard>Are you gonna eat that whole pie?

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,510
<1-13,Raj>也许吧  为啥不行
<1-13,Raj>Maybe. Why not?

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,040
<1-13,Raj>我的人生又有谁值得去为之奋斗呢
<1-13,Raj>Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,790
<1-14,Leonard>天哪  你是不是又看了一遍《BJ单身日记》
<1-14,Leonard>Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,280
<1-15,Raj>不是啊  因为大家都有了归属
<1-15,Raj>No, it's just that everybody's got someone.

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,560
<1-15,Raj>谢尔顿和艾米在一起  霍华德要结婚了
<1-15,Raj>Sheldon's with Amy, Howard's getting married,

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,050
<1-15,Raj>你在跟我妹妹约会
<1-15,Raj>you're dating my sister.

35
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,480
<1-16,Leonard>既然霍华德要结婚了
<1-16,Leonard>Now that Howard's getting married,

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,580
<1-16,Leonard>他可能会在众多充气娃娃中  挑一个前女友送你
<1-16,Leonard>maybe he'll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.

37
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,390
<1-17,Raj>你知道我的孤独是谁的错吗
<1-17,Raj>You know who I blame for my loneliness?

38
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,390
<1-17,Raj>就是美利坚合众国
<1-17,Raj>The United States of America.

39
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,950
<1-17,Raj>你们的电影和电视剧承诺这里的街道
<1-17,Raj>Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved

40
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,600
<1-17,Raj>满是漂亮的金发巨乳美女
<1-17,Raj>with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.

41
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,140
<1-18,Howard>再吃个馅饼  你就能拥有自己的巨乳了
<1-18,Howard>Eat another pie, you'll have your own bazongas.

42
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,960
<1-19,Raj>你这么说太残忍了
<1-19,Raj>That's cruel.

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,140
<1-19,Raj>你知道我的肥肉只会长在屁股上
<1-19,Raj>You know it goes straight to my hips.

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,280
<1-20,Sheldon>先生们  请专心点
<1-20,Sheldon>Gentlemen, please focus.

45
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,030
<1-20,Sheldon>你们现在面对着一条喷火龙
<1-20,Sheldon>You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,330
<1-21,Raj>我不想玩下去了
<1-21,Raj>I don't know if I want to play anymore.

47
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,930
<1-22,Sheldon>就因为你没有女朋友吗
<1-22,Sheldon>Because you don't have a girlfriend?

48
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,860
<1-22,Sheldon>我的亲娘七舅老爷
<1-22,Sheldon>Well, good Lord,

49
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,830
<1-22,Sheldon>如果因为这就不玩《龙与地下城》
<1-22,Sheldon>if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons & Dragons,

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,810
<1-22,Sheldon>那这游戏算走到头了
<1-22,Sheldon>this game's in serious trouble.

60
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,030
<2-1,Amy>等会儿我们还用这些蜡剂
<2-1,Amy>Now, I assume we use this same wax later on

61
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,730
<2-1,Amy>来互相清理我们的比基尼部位
<2-1,Amy>to neaten up each other's bikini regions.

63
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,140
<2-2,Penny>我的比基尼部位很干净
<2-2,Penny>Yeah, my bikini region is fine.

64
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,370
<2-3,Amy>谁震惊到了  我没有
<2-3,Amy>Who's shocked? I'm not.

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,710
<2-3,Amy>伯纳黛特  婚礼筹划得怎样了
<2-3,Amy>So, Bernadette, how's the wedding planning going?

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,020
<2-3,Amy>我这么问可不是想成为伴娘候选人哦
<2-3,Amy>And I'm not asking as a prospective bridesmaid.

67
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,420
<2-3,Amy>快选我吧  选我吧
<2-3,Amy>Pick me! Pick me!

<2-4,Bernadette>Raj came along.

70
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,500
<2-4,Bernadette>他痛哭流涕  还吃掉一半的蛋糕样品
<2-4,Bernadette>He cried and ate half the samples.

71
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,590
<2-5,Penny>那可怜的家伙太孤独了
<2-5,Penny>Oh, the poor guy's so lonely.

72
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,850
<2-5,Penny>我们应该给他找个伴儿
<2-5,Penny>We should set him up with someone.

73
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,440
<2-6,Bernadette>我工作时遇到了个可爱的女孩儿
<2-6,Bernadette>You know, I met a really cute girl at work.

79
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,280
<2-8,Bernadette>据称  他现在已经被安排到安慰剂组了
<2-8,Bernadette>and a little birdie told me he's in the placebo group.

81

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,700
<3-4,Sheldon>是的  从这刻起  我决定
<3-4,Sheldon>Yes. From here on in, I've decided

88
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,710
<3-4,Sheldon>以后不重要的决定都通过掷骰子决定
<3-4,Sheldon>to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice,

89
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,990
<3-4,Sheldon>这样可以为我的头脑腾出时间
<3-4,Sheldon>thus freeing up my mind

116
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,840

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,350
<3-25,Sheldon>哦耶  这就对了
<3-25,Sheldon>Bam! That's what I'm talking about!

129
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,270
<4-1,Raj>好吧  等她一到
<4-1,Raj>Okay, as soon as she gets here,

130
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,330
<4-1,Raj>既然她知道我很淡定
<4-1,Raj>so she knows I'm cool with it,

131
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,360
<4-1,Raj>所以我要就她的耳聋开个玩笑
<4-1,Raj>I'm going to make a joke about her being deaf.

132
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,410
<4-1,Raj>比如说  嘿  你听说过那个什么没有
<4-1,Raj>I was thinking, "Hey, did you hear the one about...?

133
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,250
<4-1,Raj>对哦  我忘了你听不见了
<4-1,Raj>Oh, no, I bet you didn't."

134
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,860
<4-2,Howard>你还是老老实实当回你的单身肥男好了
<4-2,Howard>Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,790
<4-3,Raj>她来了
<4-3,Raj>Oh, she's here.

136
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,550
<4-4,Howard>别开玩笑
<4-4,Howard>No joke.

137
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,740
<4-4,Howard>她说她很抱歉来迟了
<4-4,Howard>She says she's sorry she's late.

138
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,280
<4-5,Raj>跟她说没关系
<4-5,Raj>Tell her it doesn't matter.

139
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,130
<4-5,Raj>跟她说她的眼睛就像是天女宫
<4-5,Raj>Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies

140
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,070
<4-5,Raj>湖中乳白色百合一样闪烁
<4-5,Raj>in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.

141
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,380
<4-5,Raj>真的吗
<4-5,Raj>Really?

142
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,150
<4-6,Howard>你一上来就要说这句话吗
<4-6,Howard>That's the first thing you want to say?

143
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,060
<4-7,Raj>我想了整晚了  就这么说
<4-7,Raj>I worked on it all night. Use it.

144
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,090
<4-8,Howard>我不知道"乳白色"的手语
<4-8,Howard>Look, I don't know the sign for opalescent.

145
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,230
<4-9,Raj>那就拼出来给她看
<4-9,Raj>Then spell it.

146
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,240
<4-10,Howard>我不会拼
<4-10,Howard>I don't know how to spell it.

147
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,620
<4-11,Raj>你就非要给我搞砸了
<4-11,Raj>You're blowing this for me!

148
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,330
<4-12,Howard>他喜欢你的眼睛
<4-12,Howard>He likes your eyes.

149
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,340
<4-13,Raj>这下好了  我听上去就像是个山顶洞人
<4-13,Raj>You're making me sound like a caveman.

150
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,860
<4-14,Howard>她说  "谢谢  你的眼睛也很漂亮"
<4-14,Howard>She says, "Thank you. You have nice eyes, too."

151
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,300
<4-15,Raj>真的吗  问她想要几个孩子
<4-15,Raj>Really? Ask her how many children she wants,

152
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,610
<4-15,Raj>不管她说多少  你就说"我也是"
<4-15,Raj>and whatever number she says, say, "Me, too."

153
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,030
<4-16,Howard>不要
<4-16,Howard>No.

154
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,580
<4-17,Raj>好吧  那就跟她说  我的声音低沉性感
<4-17,Raj>Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice

155
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,050
<4-17,Raj>就像詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯一样
<4-17,Raj>like James Earl Jones.

157
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,830
<4-18,Howard>她哪知道詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯的声音什么样啊
<4-18,Howard>She doesn't know what James Earl Jones sounds like.

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,250
<4-19,Raj>正好  那她就不会知道我在骗人了
<4-19,Raj>Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.

159
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,990
<5-1,Raj>让我想想  我还能跟你说点我的什么
<5-1,Raj>Let's see, what else can I tell you about me

160
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,360
<5-1,Raj>来让你喜欢我呢
<5-1,Raj>that would make you like me?

161
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,170
<5-1,Raj>我热爱音乐
<5-1,Raj>Ooh, I love music.

162
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,400
<5-1,Raj>你喜欢音乐吗
<5-1,Raj>Do you love music?

163
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,980
<5-2,Howard>你真的要问她这个吗
<5-2,Howard>You really want to ask her that?

164
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,340
<5-3,Raj>也对  是人都热爱音乐啦
<5-3,Raj>You're right. Everyone loves music.

165
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,900
<5-4,Howard>她问  "你会弹奏乐器吗"
<5-4,Howard>She says, "Do you play an instrument?"

166
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,820
<5-4,Howard>不会
<5-4,Howard>No,

167
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,170
<5-5,Raj>但是我六岁的时候
<5-5,Raj>but when I was six years old,

168
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,260
<5-5,Raj>曾经想要成立一个男生乐队
<5-5,Raj>I tried to start a boy band called

170
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,090
<5-5,Raj>叫"法兰基到宝莱坞"
<5-5,Raj>Frankie Goes to Bollywood.

171
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,810
<5-5,Raj>但是我找不到其他男生肯跟我组队
<5-5,Raj>But I couldn't get any other boys to join,

172
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,540
<5-5,Raj>于是我父母就只好叫我家的仆人
<5-5,Raj>so my parents asked the servants

173
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,830
<5-5,Raj>来做我的候补舞者
<5-5,Raj>to be my backup dancers.

174
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,490
<5-5,Raj>等一下  你比划"仆人"的时候
<5-5,Raj>Wait, when you sign "servants",

175
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,870
<5-5,Raj>别比划得好像我在炫耀一样
<5-5,Raj>don't sign it like I'm bragging.

176
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,670
<5-5,Raj>要比划成我很谦虚
<5-5,Raj>Sign it in a way that I sound humble

177
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,170
<5-5,Raj>同时又透露出"没错  我有仆人"那种感觉
<5-5,Raj>with just a hint of "That's right, I had servants."

178
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,310
<5-6,Howard>天啊  你还真是满嘴胡话呀
<5-6,Howard>Do you hear yourself?

179
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,410
<5-7,Raj>怕啥  反正她又听不见  快比划呀  长臂猿
<5-7,Raj>Yes, but she doesn't. So get signing, hand monkey.

180
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,090
<6-1,Howard (translating for Emily)>我每天都给圣诞老人写一封信
<6-1,Howard (translating for Emily)>I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day.

181
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,090
<6-1,Howard (translating for Emily)>终于到了圣诞节的早上
<6-1,Howard (translating for Emily)>And then on Christmas morning,

<6-7,Howard>小狗后来死掉了  它吞了一个娃娃的头
<6-7,Howard>The puppy died -- it choked on a doll head.

<8-3,Howard>你怎么还在搞这个
<8-3,Howard>Why are you still doing this?

217
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,800
<8-4,Sheldon>因为这很有用
<8-4,Sheldon>Because it's working.

218
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,280
<8-4,Sheldon>这几周
<8-4,Sheldon>In the past few weeks,

219
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,210
<8-4,Sheldon>因为不用做琐碎的决定

<8-21,Sheldon>他给她买再多礼物也无所谓
<8-21,Sheldon>It doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts,

251
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,420
<8-21,Sheldon>因为库萨帕里家超有钱
<8-21,Sheldon>because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.

252
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,580
<8-22,Penny>你说超有钱是什么意思
<8-22,Penny>What do you mean "Vastly wealthy"?

253
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,700
<8-23,Sheldon>有钱就是指有很多钱
<8-23,Sheldon>Well, "Wealthy" Means a lot of money.

254
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,140
<8-23,Sheldon>加上个超就是有很多很多钱
<8-23,Sheldon>"Vastly" Means even more.

255
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,350
<8-23,Sheldon>这有什么听不懂的啊
<8-23,Sheldon>I'm not sure what's tripping you up.

256
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,980
<8-24,Leonard>听着  我知道他们有钱  但没这么有钱吧
<8-24,Leonard>Look, I know they have money. I don't think it's that much.

257
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,020
<8-24,Leonard>不  你错了
<8-24,Leonard>No, you're wrong.

258
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,900
<8-25,Sheldon>几年前  我实现了其中一个小梦想
<8-25,Sheldon>As you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of

259
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,880
<8-25,Sheldon>做了一名公证人
<8-25,Sheldon>my lesser dreams and became a notary public.

260
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,690
<8-25,Sheldon>时不时地
<8-25,Sheldon>Well, from time to time,

<8-26,Penny>那是有多有钱
<8-26,Penny>Well, so how much is that?

<8-26,Penny>后者是《圣诞欢歌》主人公  超有钱也超小气

265
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,250
<8-27,Sheldon>差不多介于布鲁斯·韦恩和斯克鲁奇之间
<8-27,Sheldon>About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.

<8-29,Leonard>但我得打个电话给拉杰的妹妹  我超爱的那个
<8-29,Leonard>but I need to go call Raj's sister, who I love so much.

271
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,570
<8-29,Leonard>超超超爱的那个
<8-29,Leonard>So vastly much.

277
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,240
<8-32,Penny>我们得和拉杰谈谈
<8-32,Penny>We should really talk to Raj.

<8-33,Howard>他听不进的  他坠入了爱河
<8-33,Howard>He's not going to listen, he's in love.

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,380
<9-4,Penny>你居然和我朋友订婚了
<9-4,Penny>I can't believe you're engaged to my friend.

339
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,880
<11-1,Raj>不过真爱是无价的
<11-1,Raj>but no one can put a price on love.

340
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,510
<11-1,Raj>虽然卡地亚公司让真爱变得好昂贵
<11-1,Raj>Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.

<11-8,Mrs Koothrappali>你得找个门当户对的印度姑娘
<11-8,Mrs Koothrappali>You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family.

354
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,530
<11-8,Mrs Koothrappali>你要是继续跟她好  就拿不到我们的钱
<11-8,Mrs Koothrappali>If you keep seeing this woman, you're cut off.

356
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,950
<11-9,Raj>和强烈吸引我的金钱之间做抉择
<11-9,Raj>and the money I... have very strong feelings for?

<11-13,Raj>我父母让我在钱和你之间作选择

<11-13,Raj>但那些都不重要
<11-13,Raj>But none of those things matter,

368

<12-3,Raj>Sometimes I put the TV on mute

373
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,250
<12-3,Raj>就为了假装她还和我在一起
<12-3,Raj>just to pretend she's still with me.

374
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,260
<12-3,Raj>但我一看那隐藏字幕  就忍不住哭
