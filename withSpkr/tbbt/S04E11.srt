<1-4,Sheldon>Not so fast.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,470
<1-5,Leonard>无敌谢尔顿
<1-5,Leonard>Infinite Sheldon.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,380
<1-5,Leonard>无敌谢尔顿
<1-5,Leonard>Infinite Sheldon?

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,370

<1-6,Sheldon>Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards

00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,640
<1-6,Sheldon>而且没有违背自制卡牌的规则
<1-6,Sheldon>and does not violate the rule against homemade cards

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,000
<1-6,Sheldon>因为这规则是我在工作时发明的
<1-6,Sheldon>because I made it at work.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,640
<1-7,Leonard>你明白为何别人都不想跟你一起玩吗
<1-7,Leonard>Do you understand why people don't want to play with you?

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,980
<1-7,Leonard>不明白
<1-7,Leonard>No...

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,180
<1-8,Sheldon>虽然我从幼儿园开始就一直被问这个问题
<1-8,Sheldon>Although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool.

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,910
<1-12,Penny>你的《科学》杂志寄到了我的邮箱里
<1-12,Penny>Hey, your copy of Science Magazine was in my mailbox.

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,050
<1-14,Penny>哦  谢了
<1-14,Penny>Oh, thanks. Mm-hmm.

<1-16,Leonard>这是颗原子
<1-16,Leonard>That's an atom.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,800
<1-17,Zack>各抒己见嘛
<1-17,Zack>Agree to disagree.

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,350
<1-17,Zack>这就是我喜爱科学的原因
<1-17,Zack>That's what I love about science.

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,420
<1-17,Zack>因为总没有正确的答案
<1-17,Zack>There's no one right answer.

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,430
<1-17,Zack>那么...
<1-17,Zack>So...

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,600
<1-18,Leonard>你和扎克又在一起了吗
<1-18,Leonard>You and Zack again, huh?

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,750
<1-19,Penny>是啊  我和扎克又在一起了
<1-19,Penny>Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,810
<1-20,Zack>我俩之前来过吗
<1-20,Zack>Were we here earlier?

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,480
<1-21,Penny>好吧  我看我们还是走吧
<1-21,Penny>Okay, we should, we should go.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,350
<1-22,Zack>等下
<1-22,Zack>Ah, not yet.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,540
<1-22,Zack>我还想和这帮捣腾科学的小子聊聊科学呢
<1-22,Zack>I want to talk science with the science dudes.

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,840
<1-23,Howard>好棒哦  科学小子们要和你聊科学了
<1-23,Howard>Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you.

28
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,680
<1-23,Howard>你想聊点啥呢
<1-23,Howard>What do you want to talk about,

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,600
<1-23,Howard>岩石  恐龙还是我们的好朋友海狸呢
<1-23,Howard>rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,440
<1-24,Zack>我在探索频道看过件妙事
<1-24,Zack>You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,590
<1-24,Zack>原来海星一旦被杀
<1-24,Zack>Turns out that if you kill a starfish,

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,500
<1-24,Zack>它会立刻复活
<1-24,Zack>it'll just come back to life.

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,190
<1-25,Sheldon>那海星没穿拳击短裤吧
<1-25,Sheldon>Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts?

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,960
<1-25,Sheldon>也许你看的是尼克频道[儿童频道]
<1-25,Sheldon>Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,390
<1-26,Zack>不  我比较确定看的是探索频道
<1-26,Zack>No, I'm almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel.

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,060
<1-26,Zack>那是个不错的节目
<1-26,Zack>It was a great show.

37
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,850
<1-26,Zack>节目还说海豚可能比人还聪明
<1-26,Zack>They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,990
<1-27,Leonard>海豚可能比某些人聪明
<1-27,Leonard>They might be smarter than some people.

39
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,540
<1-28,Zack>也许我们可以做个试验看看
<1-28,Zack>Maybe we can do an experiment to find out.

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,840
<1-29,Sheldon>这很容易
<1-29,Sheldon>That's easy enough.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,090
<1-29,Sheldon>我们找一缸水  找个海豚能穿过去的铁圈
<1-29,Sheldon>We'd need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through,

42
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,470
<1-29,Sheldon>再找一桶你喜欢吃的饵料就行了
<1-29,Sheldon>and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.

43
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,520
<1-30,Zack>我没听懂
<1-30,Zack>I don't get it.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,930
<1-31,Leonard>海豚可能懂
<1-31,Leonard>A dolphin might.

45
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,150
<1-32,Zack>我明白了
<1-32,Zack>Oh, I see.

46
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,790
<1-32,Zack>你们是说我傻是吧
<1-32,Zack>You guys are inferring that I'm stupid.

47
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,350
<1-33,Sheldon>你这就错了
<1-33,Sheldon>That's not correct.

48
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,720
<1-33,Sheldon>我们是在暗喻
<1-33,Sheldon>We were implying it.

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,250
<1-33,Sheldon>是你自己说出来的
<1-33,Sheldon>You then inferred it.

50
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,990
<1-34,Zack>我们走
<1-34,Zack>Let's go.

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,680
<1-35,Penny>有这样一群人
<1-35,Penny>You know, for a group of guys

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,250
<1-35,Penny>一辈子可能都会被别人羞辱欺负着
<1-35,Penny>who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied,

53
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,790
<1-35,Penny>你们就是那羞辱人的混蛋
<1-35,Penny>you can be real jerks.

54
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,690
<1-35,Penny>为你们感到羞耻
<1-35,Penny>Shame on all of you.

55
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,390
<1-36,Raj>我什么都没做过啊
<1-36,Raj>What the hell did I do?

56
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,150
<1-37,Penny (Opens door again)>你笑了
<1-37,Penny (Opens door again)>You laughed.

57
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,630
<1-37,Penny (Opens door again)>生活大爆炸
<1-37,Penny (Opens door again)>第四季第十一集

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,260
<2-1,Leonard>你们也认同佩妮的说法吗
<2-1,Leonard>Do you think Penny's right?

59
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,000
<2-1,Leonard>我们刚才是在欺负扎克吗
<2-1,Leonard>Were we bullying Zack?

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,730
<2-2,Howard>不  我知道什么叫欺负
<2-2,Howard>No, I know bullying.

61
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,460
<2-2,Howard>他刚才走得很淡定  内裤也好端端地在屁股上呢
<2-2,Howard>He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.

62
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,710
<2-3,Raj>而且也没人把鸡鸡画到他额头上啊
<2-3,Raj>And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.

63
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,790
<2-4,Leonard>有人画到过你额头上吗
<2-4,Leonard>That happened to you?

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,130
<2-5,Raj>我去板球训练营的第一天
<2-5,Raj>First day of cricket camp.

65
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,920
<2-5,Raj>他们就是想拿我的俩眼睛当蛋蛋
<2-5,Raj>They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,300
<2-6,Leonard>我觉得我们还是得跟那家伙道个歉
<2-6,Leonard>I don't know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.

67
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,850
<2-7,Howard>-那你去道歉呗  -为什么是我去
<2-7,Howard>- So go apologize. - Why me?

68
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,490
<2-9,Howard>你开的头  我们只是附和罢了
<2-9,Howard>You started it, we just piled on.

69
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,830
<2-10,Leonard>那我该怎么说
<2-10,Leonard>What would I even say?

70
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,630
<2-11,Sheldon>扎克  很抱歉  你太蠢了
<2-11,Sheldon>Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

71
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,250
<2-12,Raj>吃点奶球吧
<2-12,Raj>Have a Milk Dud.

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
<2-12,Raj>奶球
<2-12,Raj>A Milk Dud?

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,260
<2-13,Sheldon>是的  凭借奶球这自嘲的名字
<2-13,Sheldon>Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name

74
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,130
<2-13,Sheldon>外加温和的口味
<2-13,Sheldon>and remarkably mild flavor,

75
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,260
<2-13,Sheldon>是盒装糖果里最能表达歉意的
<2-13,Sheldon>are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.

76
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,630
<2-14,Leonard>我有个好主意
<2-14,Leonard>I got a better idea.

77
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,480
<2-14,Leonard>这事儿我们都有责任
<2-14,Leonard>We're all responsible.

78
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,050
<2-14,Leonard>所以都该去道歉
<2-14,Leonard>I say we all go.

79
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,160
<2-14,Leonard>拜托  谁跟我一起去一下呢
<2-14,Leonard>Come on, who's with me?

<2-14,Leonard>我可能会被海扁一顿  你们不想看看吗
<2-14,Leonard>I might get punched. You really want to miss that?

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,700
<2-15,Raj>薄荷糖也挺有道歉味道的
<2-15,Raj>Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.

83
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,800
<2-16,Sheldon>你这是在自取其辱
<2-16,Sheldon>You're embarrassing yourself.

<3-5,Leonard>我们之前说的那些
<3-5,Leonard>Listen, the stuff we were saying before,

88
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,850
<3-5,Leonard>只不过是跟你开玩笑来着
<3-5,Leonard>we were just kidding around.

89
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,580
<3-6,Zack>才不是呢
<3-6,Zack>No, you weren't.

90
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,140
<3-6,Zack>你们刚才在嘲讽我
<3-6,Zack>You were making fun of me.

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,670
<3-8,Sheldon>你这话太伤人了
<3-8,Sheldon>That's very hurtful.

96
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,260
<3-9,Leonard>看到了吧
<3-9,Leonard>See?

97
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,090
<3-10,Zack>我不知道  还是觉得很不爽
<3-10,Zack>I don't know, it still wasn't very nice.

98
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,190
<3-11,Sheldon>奶球要吗

<3-15,Leonard>我们正打算去漫画书店呢
<3-15,Leonard>Uh, we're on our way to the comic book store.

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,360
<3-18,Sheldon>没去过漫画书店了
<3-18,Sheldon>in literally a million years.

108
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,800
<3-18,Sheldon>真的吗
<3-18,Sheldon>Literally?

109

<3-18,Sheldon>是字面上理解的一百万年吗
<3-18,Sheldon>Literally a million years?

<4-2,Sheldon>In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.

<4-3,Zack>你说的那是老阿奇漫画
<4-3,Zack>Oh, no, you're thinking old-school Archie.

122
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,250
<4-3,Zack>现在已经成熟多了
<4-3,Zack>It's much more sophisticated now.

123
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,780
<4-3,Zack>比如说  有两个宇宙
<4-3,Zack>Like, there's two universes,

124
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,270
<4-3,Zack>阿奇在一个宇宙去了贝蒂
<4-3,Zack>and Archie's married to Betty in one

125
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,580
<4-3,Zack>在另一个娶了维罗妮卡
<4-3,Zack>and Veronica in the other.

127
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,860
<4-3,Zack>米吉甚至和慕思分手了
<4-3,Zack>Midge is even breaking up with Moose.

128

<4-4,Raj>No.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,540
<4-5,Zack>早该改了  对吧
<4-5,Zack>About time, right?

130
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,980
<4-8,Stuart>你们终于合伙雇了位保镖啦
<4-8,Stuart>Hey. You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?

131
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,140
<4-9,Leonard>不是  这位是扎克
<4-9,Leonard>Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack.

132
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,110
<4-9,Leonard>只是朋友而已
<4-9,Leonard>He's a friend of ours.

133
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,050
<4-9,Leonard>扎克  这位是斯图尔特
<4-9,Leonard>Zack, this is Stuart.

134
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,310

<4-11,Stuart>Yeah, I work 70 hours a week

137
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,920
<4-11,Stuart>平均每小时赚一块六毛五
<4-11,Stuart>and average $1.65 an hour.

138
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,210
<4-12,Zack>很赞啊
<4-12,Zack>Sweet.

139
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,180
<4-13,Stuart>他这是讽刺我吗
<4-13,Stuart>Is that sarcasm?

140
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,210
<4-14,Howard>非也  他是在控诉无能的美国教育系统
<4-14,Howard>No, it's an indictment of the American education system.

141
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,630
<4-15,Raj>阿奇漫画都在那边呢
<4-15,Raj>The Archies are over here.

142
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,360
<4-16,Zack>好滴
<4-16,Zack>Yippee.

143
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,940
<4-17,Stuart>你们几位来不来我的新年化装派对啊
<4-17,Stuart>So are you guys coming to my New Year's Eve costume party?

144
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,850
<4-18,Sheldon>当然来啊
<4-18,Sheldon>Of course.

145
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,090
<4-18,Sheldon>我们要组成美国正义联盟
<4-18,Sheldon>We're coming as the Justice League of America.

147
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,340
<4-19,Howard>阵容安排得换一下
<4-19,Howard>Switching it up from last year

148
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,480
<4-19,Howard>不能和去年的重复了
<4-19,Howard>when we came as the Justice League of America.

149
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,310
<4-20,Sheldon>你这么一提
<4-20,Sheldon>To that point,

150
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,360
<4-20,Sheldon>让我忽然想起来  我们今年很有可能
<4-20,Sheldon>it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity

151
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,970
<4-20,Sheldon>最终赢得最佳团体服饰奖
<4-20,Sheldon>to finally snare Best Group Costume

152
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,060
<4-20,Sheldon>只要我们加强了当初的短板
<4-20,Sheldon>if we shore up our weak link,

153
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,060
<4-20,Sheldon>显然也就是莱纳德扮的超人
<4-20,Sheldon>which is clearly Leonard as Superman.

154
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,020
<4-21,Leonard>喂  我今年新买了靴子好吧
<4-21,Leonard>Hey, I got new boots this year.

155
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,450
<4-21,Leonard>保证能增高三英寸
<4-21,Leonard>Guaranteed to add three inches.

156
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,120
<4-22,Sheldon>真可悲
<4-22,Sheldon>That's sad.

157
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,000
<4-22,Sheldon>请扪心自问
<4-22,Sheldon>Let's ask ourselves:

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,210
<4-22,Sheldon>我们认识的人中有哪位
<4-22,Sheldon>Is there anyone we know

159
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,990
<4-22,Sheldon>能扮好更爷们更合适的氪星之子[即超人]呢
<4-22,Sheldon>who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?

160
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,880
<4-23,Stuart>比穿高跟靴的莱纳德更爷们吗
<4-23,Stuart>Than Leonard in high-heeled boots?

161
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,450
<4-23,Stuart>跟穿高跟靴的霍华德老妈呢
<4-23,Stuart>Howard's mother in high-heeled boots?

162
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,650
<4-24,Sheldon>我想到了那边那位
<4-24,Sheldon>I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there

163
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,470
<4-24,Sheldon>念念有词欣赏最新《贝蒂和维罗妮卡》的先生
<4-24,Sheldon>moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.

164
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,350
<4-25,Leonard>扎克吗
<4-25,Leonard>Zack?

165
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,670
<4-26,Howard>他是我们认识的  唯一有真正肌肉的人
<4-26,Howard>He is the only person we know with actual muscles.

166
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,010
<4-27,Leonard>你们不能让扎克代替我
<4-27,Leonard>You can't replace me with Zack.

167
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,350
<4-28,Sheldon>为啥不行  佩妮不就这么做了
<4-28,Sheldon>Why not? Penny did it.

168
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,630
<4-29,Howard>对啊  她好像比以前更开心了
<4-29,Howard>Yeah, she seems happier.

169
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,550
<4-29,Howard>为啥我们不行
<4-29,Howard>Why wouldn't we be?

170
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
<4-30,Zack>爽啊
<4-30,Zack>Score.

171

<4-30,Zack>I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica,

172
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,180
<4-30,Zack>还有《笨瓜》这册
<4-30,Zack>and a Jughead.

<4-31,Sheldon>Congratulations.

175
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,340
<4-31,Sheldon>扎克  你觉得当超人感觉如何
<4-31,Sheldon>Zack, how would you like to be Superman?

176
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,450
<4-32,Zack>不知道诶  听起来责任重大啊
<4-32,Zack>I don't kow. Sounds like a lot of responsibility.

177
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,990
<5-1,Leonard>好吧  如果扎克当超人的话
<5-1,Leonard>Fine. If Zack's gonna be Superman,

178
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,290
<5-1,Leonard>那我就要当绿灯侠
<5-1,Leonard>I want to be Green Lantern.

179
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,330
<5-2,Raj>可我才是绿灯侠啊
<5-2,Raj>But I'm Green Lantern.

180
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,790
<5-3,Leonard>你可以去当水行侠嘛
<5-3,Leonard>You can be Aquaman.

181
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,900
<5-4,Raj>我才不想当水行侠呢
<5-4,Raj>I don't want to be Aquaman.

182
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,990
<5-4,Raj>太衰了

<5-4,Raj>He sucks fish pee.

185
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,620
<5-5,Sheldon>容我插句嘴
<5-5,Sheldon>Excuse me,

186
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,940
<5-5,Sheldon>我觉得水行侠会用他的通灵术
<5-5,Sheldon>I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers

187
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,470
<5-5,Sheldon>让鱼儿们上别处撒尿去
<5-5,Sheldon>to request the fish do their business elsewhere.

188

<5-6,Zack>嗨  宝贝

243
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,920
<6-19,Howard>其实...
<6-19,Howard>Well, actually...

244
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,110
<6-20,Sheldon>闭嘴  他在为我们说话呢
<6-20,Sheldon>Don't. He's making our case.

245
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,730
<6-21,Zack>好吧  宝贝儿
<6-21,Zack>Okay, babe. Uh...

246
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,500
<6-21,Zack>你让我在朋友面前有些难堪
<6-21,Zack>Kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.

247
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,640
<6-22,Penny>得了  告诉你
<6-22,Penny>Okay. You know what?

248
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,370
<6-22,Penny>我改主意了  我不去了
<6-22,Penny>I changed my mind. I'm not going.

249
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,870
<6-23,Raj>看来神奇女侠要换人咯
<6-23,Raj>Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.

250
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,180
<7-1,Zack>宝贝  开门
<7-1,Zack>Babe, open up.

251
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,190
<7-2,Penny>我不和你说话
<7-2,Penny>I'm not talking to you.

252
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,470
<7-3,Zack>那你现在在和谁说话
<7-3,Zack>Then who are you talking to?

253
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,540
<7-3,Zack>宝贝
<7-3,Zack>Babe?

254
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:37,660
<7-4,Sheldon>佩妮  佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
<7-4,Sheldon>Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

255
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,590
<7-5,Penny>你到底有什么毛病
<7-5,Penny>What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,970
<7-5,Penny>我是闪电侠
<7-5,Penny>I'm the Flash.

257
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,410
<7-6,Sheldon>我刚敲了三万次门
<7-6,Sheldon>I just knocked 30,000 times.

258
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,390
<7-7,Penny>得  你要干嘛  谢尔顿
<7-7,Penny>Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?

259
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,360
<7-8,Sheldon>我明白你为什么不开心
<7-8,Sheldon>I understand why you're upset.

260
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,350
<7-9,Penny>是吗
<7-9,Penny>Really?

261
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,480
<7-9,Penny>是的
<7-9,Penny>Yes.

262
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,810
<7-10,Sheldon>你担心这个装扮会让你显胖
<7-10,Sheldon>You're afraid that costume makes you look fat.

263
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,470
<7-10,Sheldon>不是
<7-10,Sheldon>No.

264
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,850
<7-11,Penny>怎么...
<7-11,Penny>Wh-What...

265
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,160
<7-11,Penny>很显胖吗
<7-11,Penny>Does it?

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,210
<7-12,Sheldon>不用担心
<7-12,Sheldon>Don't worry.

267
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,500
<7-12,Sheldon>神奇女侠是亚马逊人
<7-12,Sheldon>Wonder Woman was an Amazon.

268
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,340
<7-12,Sheldon>亚马逊的女孩子都很高大健壮
<7-12,Sheldon>And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.

269
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,500
<7-13,Penny>滚吧  谢尔顿
<7-13,Penny>Good-bye, Sheldon.

270
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,780
<7-14,Sheldon>但她们不是金发  快把假发戴上
<7-14,Sheldon>But they're not blonde, so put on your wig.

271
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,060
<7-14,Sheldon>听到吗
<7-14,Sheldon>Hello?

272
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,100
<8-1,Raj>傻逼水行侠
<8-1,Raj>Stupid Aquaman.

273
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,470
<8-2,Leonard>不知道这样算不算安慰
<8-2,Leonard>If it makes you feel any better,

274
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,440
<8-2,Leonard>我以前和佩妮交往时
<8-2,Leonard>when I was dating Penny,

275
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,960
<8-2,Leonard>她也一直会生我的气
<8-2,Leonard>she used to flip out on me all the time.

276
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,300
<8-3,Zack>啥  你和佩妮约会过
<8-3,Zack>Whoa. You dated Penny?

277
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,250
<8-4,Leonard>她都没和你说吗
<8-4,Leonard>She didn't tell you?

278
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,150
<8-5,Zack>她说和个叫莱纳德的人交往过
<8-5,Zack>She told me she dated a guy named Leonard.

279
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,360
<8-5,Zack>谁会想到那就是你
<8-5,Zack>Who would have thought it was you?

280
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,370
<8-6,Leonard>那还能是谁
<8-6,Leonard>Who else would it be?

281
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,420
<8-7,Zack>我也不知道  某个更壮的...
<8-7,Zack>I don't know. Somebody bigger and...

282
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,030
<8-7,Zack>可不是  显然是你嘛
<8-7,Zack>Yeah, sure. Why not you?

283
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,170
<8-8,Sheldon>我也许失败了
<8-8,Sheldon>I may have failed.

284
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,690
<8-9,Howard>好吧  那我们只能不带神奇女侠去了
<8-9,Howard>Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.

285
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,210
<8-10,Zack>佩妮不去我也不去
<8-10,Zack>I don't want to go without Penny.

286
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,010
<8-11,Raj>太好了  没有超人  没有神奇女侠
<8-11,Raj>Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman?

287
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,540
<8-11,Raj>就只有瘦骨嶙峋的闪电侠
<8-11,Raj>All we've got is a skinny Flash,

288
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,020
<8-11,Raj>印度水行侠
<8-11,Raj>an Indian Aquaman,

289
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,550
<8-11,Raj>近视的绿灯侠
<8-11,Raj>a nearsighted Green Lantern,

290
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,380
<8-11,Raj>还有个袖珍型的蝙蝠侠
<8-11,Raj>and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.

291
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,390
<8-12,Sheldon>显然  这不能再称为正义联盟
<8-12,Sheldon>Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League.

293
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,460
<8-12,Sheldon>没办法了  只能换布偶装了
<8-12,Sheldon>We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.

294
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,480
<8-13,Raj>我要当科米蛙
<8-13,Raj>Ooh, I call Kermit.

295
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,780
<8-13,Raj>（科米蛙是该秀的导演和支持
<8-13,Raj>斯库特是跑腿  剧场主人的侄子）

296
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,780
<8-14,Sheldon>我才是科米蛙  你当斯库特
<8-14,Sheldon>I'm Kermit. U're Scooter.

297
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,340
<8-15,Raj>不要  斯库特太衰了
<8-15,Raj>Oh, man. Scooter sucks.

298
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,260
<8-15,Raj>他就是《大青蛙布偶秀》里的水行侠
<8-15,Raj>He's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.

299
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,380
<8-16,Howard>不  不到最后不能放弃
<8-16,Howard>No, we can still make this work.

300
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,240
<8-16,Howard>莱纳德  你去找佩妮谈
<8-16,Howard>Leonard, you talk to Penny.

301
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,220
<8-17,Leonard>你为啥觉得我能说服她
<8-17,Leonard>What makes you think I can convince her?

302
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,790
<8-18,Howard>你都让她跟你上床了
<8-18,Howard>You got her to have sex with you.

303
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,290
<8-18,Howard>很明显  你的超能力就是给人洗脑
<8-18,Howard>Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.

304
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,800
<8-19,Leonard>好吧  看我这么说对不对
<8-19,Leonard>Okay, let me see if I understand this.

305
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,140
<8-19,Leonard>你想让我去说服我前女友
<8-19,Leonard>You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend

306
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,730
<8-19,Leonard>去跟她的新男友一起参加化装派对
<8-19,Leonard>to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend

307
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,730
<8-19,Leonard>就为了让我们赢那个愚蠢的奖吗
<8-19,Leonard>just so we can win a stupid prize?

308
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,700
<8-20,Sheldon>对  记得让她戴上黑假发  好运
<8-20,Sheldon>Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.

309
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,930
<9-1,Penny>走开  谢尔顿
<9-1,Penny>Go away, Sheldon.

310
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,140
<9-2,Leonard>我是莱纳德
<9-2,Leonard>It's Leonard.

311
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,100
<9-3,Penny>走开  莱纳德
<9-3,Penny>Go away, Leonard.

312
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,240
<9-3,Penny>拜托  让我跟你谈谈
<9-3,Penny>Come on, let me just talk to you.

313
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,350
<9-4,Penny>门开着呢
<9-4,Penny>It's open.

314
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,190
<9-6,Penny>我不会去那派对的  莱纳德
<9-6,Penny>I'm not going to that party, Leonard.

315
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,230
<9-7,Leonard>听我说  你不必戴那假发
<9-7,Leonard>Okay, listen. You don't have to wear the wig.

316
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,720
<9-7,Leonard>只要能带个女生去那派对
<9-7,Leonard>At this party, we're gonna win first prize

317
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,170
<9-7,Leonard>我们就等于不战而胜了
<9-7,Leonard>just by showing up with a girl.

318
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,320
<9-8,Penny>不是假发的问题
<9-8,Penny>It's not the wig.

319
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,910
<9-8,Penny>那是因为我吗
<9-8,Penny>Did I do something?

320
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,590
<9-9,Leonard>我想跟扎克交个朋友
<9-9,Leonard>I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack,

321
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,420
<9-9,Leonard>相信我  那对我并不容易
<9-9,Leonard>like you said, which believe me, was difficult,

322
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,360
<9-9,Leonard>鉴于你我之前...
<9-9,Leonard>given how you and me used to be...

323
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,830
<9-9,Leonard>之前是我们  现在你和他在一起了
<9-9,Leonard>you know, "You and me," And now you and him are "You and him."

324
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,480
<9-10,Penny>其实  我们并没真正在一起
<9-10,Penny>Okay, look. We're not really "Me and him."

325
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,790
<9-11,Leonard>那你俩这算什么
<9-11,Leonard>Then what are you?

326
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,730
<9-11,Leonard>我不知道
<9-11,Leonard>I don't know.

327
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,440
<9-12,Penny>我之所以重新跟扎克约会
<9-12,Penny>I only started seeing Zack again

328
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,230
<9-12,Penny>只因为我不想独自度过新年夜
<9-12,Penny>so I wouldn't be alone on New Year's Eve.

329
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,240
<9-12,Penny>多可悲啊
<9-12,Penny>How pathetic is that?

330
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,260
<9-13,Leonard>没有穿成这个样子
<9-13,Leonard>Not as pathetic as dressing up like this

331
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,600
<9-13,Leonard>新年夜去漫画书店度过可悲
<9-13,Leonard>and going to a comic book store on New Year's Eve.

332
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,780
<9-14,Penny>你扮成绿箭侠很可爱
<9-14,Penny>You make a cute Green Arrow.

333
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,630
<9-15,Leonard>这是绿灯侠
<9-15,Leonard>Green Lantern.

334
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,340
<9-16,Penny>又没什么区别
<9-16,Penny>Like there's a difference.

335
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,580
<9-17,Leonard>有很大区别
<9-17,Leonard>There's a big difference.

336
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,330
<9-14,Penny>射箭是这样的
<9-14,Penny>Arrow.

337
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,100
<9-15,Leonard>提灯是这样的
<9-15,Leonard>Lantern.

338
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,930
<9-18,Penny>随便吧  要是我和扎克去一个
<9-18,Penny>Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone

339
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,660
<9-18,Penny>普通的夜店或派对  那就没问题
<9-18,Penny>to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine,

340
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,740
<9-18,Penny>但让我扮成这样  还有你...
<9-18,Penny>but this, with the costumes, and you...

341
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,380
<9-19,Leonard>我怎么了
<9-19,Leonard>What about me?

342
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,880
<9-20,Penny>没什么
<9-20,Penny>Nothing.

343
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,400
<9-20,Penny>我们去派对吧
<9-20,Penny>Let's go to the party.

344
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,130
<9-20,Penny>我看起来怎样
<9-20,Penny>How do I look?

345
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,250
<9-21,Leonard>我保证你会是派对上最靓的女孩
<9-21,Leonard>I guarantee you'll be the prettiest girl there.

349
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,820
<9-26,Howard>超人今晚不会有"性福"了
<9-26,Howard>Superman probably isn't getting laid tonight.

<9-27,Zack>该死
