1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,260
<1-1,Howard>斯图尔特
<1-1,Howard>Oh, hey, Stuart,

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,580
<1-1,Howard>我有个太空之旅的纪念品要送你
<1-1,Howard>I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,640
<1-2,Stuart>霍华德  你真好
<1-2,Stuart>Well, Howard, that's very nice of you.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,940
<1-3,Leonard>难说哦  先打开看看吧
<1-3,Leonard>Yeah, maybe. Open it first.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,910
<1-4,Howard>我的宇航局官方肖像画哦
<1-4,Howard>It's my official NASA portrait.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,920
<1-5,Stuart>"致斯图尔特  你的漫画店是店上之店
<1-5,Stuart>"To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,970
<1-5,Stuart>就像画里的人是人上之人 一样"
<1-5,Stuart>Just like the guy in this picture was."

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,810
<1-6,Sheldon>他还觉得沃尔格林[连锁药店]
<1-6,Sheldon>For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,530
<1-6,Sheldon>以及干洗店也是店上之店呢
<1-6,Sheldon>and the dry cleaners are out of this world.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,950
<1-7,Howard>此言差矣
<1-7,Howard>That's not true.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,020
<1-7,Howard>在沃尔格林时
<1-7,Howard>At the Walgreens,

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,050
<1-7,Howard>我称赞他们的药  "甩众店于九霄云外"
<1-7,Howard>I was "over the moon" for their store-brand antacids.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,660
<1-8,Raj>斯图尔特  你开始为万圣节派对做准备啦
<1-8,Raj>Stuart, I see you're getting ready for your Halloween party.

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,410
<1-9,Stuart>这可是我每年的泡妞时节呢
<1-9,Stuart>Yeah, it's my annual attempt to meet women.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,990
<1-9,Stuart>希望第九次可以手到妞来
<1-9,Stuart>Ninth time's the charm.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,700
<1-10,Raj>需要我帮忙吗
<1-10,Raj>Would you like me to help?

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,540
<1-10,Raj>置办派对  我可是有不少锦囊妙计哦
<1-10,Raj>I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,840
<1-11,Stuart>谢了  "锦囊妙计"我付不起
<1-11,Stuart>Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quois.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,950
<1-11,Stuart>单纯"妙计"要多少钱
<1-11,Stuart>How much for just quois?

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,870
<1-12,Raj>不用担心钱
<1-12,Raj>You know, you don't worry about money.

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,380
<1-12,Raj>-钱的事交给我  -真的吗
<1-12,Raj>- I'll take care of everything. - Really?

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,790
<1-14,Raj>对啊  库萨"派"里  顾名思义就是办派对之王啊
<1-14,Raj>Yeah, you'll love it. Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,860
<1-15,Howard>你们知道什么绝不算派对吗
<1-15,Howard>But you know what wasn't a party?

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,540
<1-15,Howard>火箭发射前的一晚
<1-15,Howard>That hotel in Kazakhstan

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,870
<1-15,Howard>我被安排入住哈萨克斯坦的酒店
<1-15,Howard>they put you up in before the launch.

26
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,830
<1-15,Howard>那可是我待在地球的最后一晚
<1-15,Howard>I mean, it's your last night on Earth.

27
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,840
<1-15,Howard>还以为会送个黄片频道看看呢
<1-15,Howard>You'd think you'd get one porn channel.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,280
<1-16,Leonard>你发现霍华德可以把任何话题
<1-16,Leonard>Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,920
<1-16,Leonard>都拿来炫耀去过太空吗
<1-16,Leonard>and use it to remind you that he went to space?

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,370
<1-17,Sheldon>这假设有意思
<1-17,Sheldon>Interesting hypothesis.

31
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,920
<1-17,Sheldon>套用科学的方法
<1-17,Sheldon>Let's apply the scientific method,

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,190
<1-17,Sheldon>-做实验证明吧  -没问题
<1-17,Sheldon>-perform an experiment. -Okay.

33
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,740
<1-18,Leonard>霍华德  今晚想去哪里吃饭呀
<1-18,Leonard>Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,600
<1-19,Howard>哪里都行  别去太空站就好
<1-19,Howard>Anywhere but the Space Station.

35
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,480
<1-19,Howard>运气好时  也就一包肉饼
<1-19,Howard>On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf.

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,250
<1-19,Howard>不过去那里  不为美食
<1-19,Howard>But, hey, you don't go there for the food,

37
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,110
<1-19,Howard>只为美景嘛
<1-19,Howard>you go there for the view.

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,430
<1-20,Sheldon>太厉害了
<1-20,Sheldon>It's fascinating.

39
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,450
<1-20,Sheldon>让我再试试  看结果是否相同
<1-20,Sheldon>Let me see if I can duplicate the result.

40
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,810
<1-20,Sheldon>霍华德  我一直觉得
<1-20,Sheldon>Howard, I've always thought

41
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,030
<1-20,Sheldon>人们太看轻柠檬了
<1-20,Sheldon>the lemon was an underrated fruit.

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,060
<1-20,Sheldon>有何高见
<1-20,Sheldon>Care to weigh in?

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,150
<1-21,Howard>其实还真没有
<1-21,Howard>Not really.

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,550
<1-22,Sheldon>遗憾啊
<1-22,Sheldon>Oh, well.

45
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,790
<1-23,Howard>有人笑过联合号太空舱像颗柠檬
<1-23,Howard>You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon.

46
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,190
<1-23,Howard>但好歹它带我上过天  又平安返航
<1-23,Howard>But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.

48
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,840
<2-1,Amy>能在起司工厂度过闺蜜之夜
<2-1,Amy>Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory.

49
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,090
<2-1,Amy>还有比这更美好的时刻吗
<2-1,Amy>Does it get any better than this?

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,740
<2-2,Penny>希望会有
<2-2,Penny>I hope so.

51
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,120
<2-3,Amy>提问
<2-3,Amy>Question.

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,670
<2-3,Amy>你觉得你丈夫对高领衣服的热爱
<2-3,Amy>Do you think your husband's fondness for turtlenecks

53
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,840
<2-3,Amy>是在缅怀被犹太割礼掉的包皮吗
<2-3,Amy>is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,280
<2-4,Penny>看样子是没有
<2-4,Penny>It's not getting any better.

55
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,830
<2-4,Penny>是莱纳德
<2-4,Penny>Uch. It's Leonard.

56
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,960
<2-4,Penny>想拉我去买万圣节化装服
<2-4,Penny>He wants to go costume shopping later.

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,470
<2-5,Bernadette>-你不是喜欢过万圣节的吗  -是啊
<2-5,Bernadette>- I thought you liked Halloween. - I do, it's just

58
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,770
<2-6,Penny>但他想去那个漫画店的派对
<2-6,Penny>he wants to go to that party at the comic book store.

59
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,150
<2-6,Penny>在那里混的很多男的都怪怪的
<2-6,Penny>A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,570
<2-7,Bernadette>-比如我老公嘛吗  -以及我男朋友吗
<2-7,Bernadette>- Like my husband? - And my boyfriend?

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,220
<2-9,Penny>艾米  抱歉
<2-9,Penny>I'm, I'm sorry, Amy.

62
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,520
<2-9,Penny>你刚说到霍华德的包皮什么来着
<2-9,Penny>You were saying something about Howard's foreskin?

63
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,480
<2-10,Bernadette>少来了  你必须参加那个派对
<2-10,Bernadette>Nice try, but you have to go to that party

64
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,290
<2-11,Penny>-因为我们俩都会去  -我会去啊
<2-11,Penny>- 'cause we're going. - Yeah, I'm gonna go.

65
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,400
<2-11,Penny>只是那里并非我心中的欢乐派对
<2-11,Penny>It's just not my idea of a good time.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,170
<2-12,Bernadette>莱纳德也常牺牲自己  哄你开心啊
<2-12,Bernadette>Leonard does thing he doesn't like to make you happy.

67
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,500
<2-13,Penny>他是我男朋友  这是他的义务
<2-13,Penny>Yeah, he's my boyfriend. Isn't that, like, his job?

68
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,740
<2-14,Amy>那你的义务是什么
<2-14,Amy>Then what's your job?

69
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
<2-15,Penny>给他哄我开心的机会啊
<2-15,Penny>Letting him make me happy.

70
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,330
<2-16,Bernadette>我觉得感情上
<2-16,Bernadette>I just think in relationships

71
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,240
<2-16,Bernadette>你付出多少才能得到多少
<2-16,Bernadette>you get back what you put into them.

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,690
<2-17,Amy>也不是永远都这样
<2-17,Amy>That's not always true.

73
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,960
<2-17,Amy>昨晚我对谢尔顿施展了我的迷魂眼
<2-17,Amy>Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look,

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,410
<2-17,Amy>结果他对我解释了
<2-17,Amy>and he responded by explaining how

75
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,550
<2-17,Amy>人类种植稻米的起源
<2-17,Amy>wheat came to be cultivated.

76
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,420
<2-18,Penny>我是可以努力试试啦
<2-18,Penny>I guess I could probably try a little harder.

77
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,040
<2-19,Bernadette>你可以从对他的工作表现出兴趣开始
<2-19,Bernadette>You could start by taking an interest in his work.

78
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,150
<2-20,Penny>-那有点难度啊  -为什么
<2-20,Penny>- Yeah, that's kind of a problem. - Why?

79
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,350
<2-22,Penny>我搞不懂他做什么工作啊
<2-22,Penny>Not really clear on what he does.

80
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,260
<2-23,Bernadette>他是个实验物理学家
<2-23,Bernadette>He's an experimental physicist.

81
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,960
<2-24,Penny>这我也不太理解是什么
<2-24,Penny>Yeah, I'm not really clear on what that means.

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,880
<2-25,Amy>他提出假设  然后设计实验
<2-25,Amy>He takes hypotheses and designs protocols

83
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,460
<2-25,Amy>从而验证其正确性
<2-25,Amy>to determine their accuracy.

84
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,650
<2-26,Penny>很好  现在我更搞不懂了
<2-26,Penny>Yeah, you're really just making it worse.

85
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,460
<3-1,Sheldon>你想喝什么茶
<3-1,Sheldon>What kind of tea would you like?

86
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,190
<3-2,Amy>我想喝  绿茶混柠檬活力茶
<3-2,Amy>I think I'm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,590
<3-3,Sheldon>两茶一杯吗
<3-3,Sheldon>Two tea bags in one cup?

88
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,340
<3-3,Sheldon>又不是在狂欢派对
<3-3,Sheldon>You're not at a rave.

89
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,500
<3-4,Amy>谢尔顿  我在想件事
<3-4,Amy>So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking,

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,870
<3-4,Amy>这次是我们确定关系后
<3-4,Amy>since this is gonna be our first

91
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,040
<3-4,Amy>首次共度的万圣节派对
<3-4,Amy>Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend,

92
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,330
<3-4,Amy>我想我们准备一套情侣化装服会不错吧
<3-4,Amy>I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.

93
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,500
<3-5,Sheldon>完全同意
<3-5,Sheldon>I couldn't agree more.

94
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,700
<3-6,Amy>真的吗  这不像是
<3-6,Amy>Really? I find that inconsistent

95
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,870
<3-6,Amy>我认识的你会说的话啊
<3-6,Amy>with everything I know about you.

96
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,280
<3-7,Sheldon>这次恰恰相反
<3-7,Sheldon>Oh, oh, on the contrary.

97
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,880
<3-7,Sheldon>情侣化装服可是当情侣少有的
<3-7,Sheldon>Couples costumes are one of the few benefits

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,690
<3-7,Sheldon>好处之一呢
<3-7,Sheldon>of being in a relationship.

99
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,250
<3-7,Sheldon>想象一下
<3-7,Sheldon>Now imagine this:

100
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,120
<3-7,Sheldon>你我一同步入斯图尔特的派对
<3-7,Sheldon>you and I entering Stuart's party

101
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,280
<3-7,Sheldon>众人目光聚焦在全美最有爱
<3-7,Sheldon>and all eyes turn to see America's most beloved

102
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,660
<3-7,Sheldon>-最迷人的情侣身上  -是吗
<3-7,Sheldon>- and glamorous couple. - Yeah?

103
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,950
<3-8,Amy>R2-D2与C-3PO
<3-8,Amy>R2-D2 and C-3PO!

105
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,330
<3-9,Sheldon>我要扮3PO
<3-9,Sheldon>Dibs on 3PO.

106
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,020
<3-10,Amy>谢尔顿  我说情侣化装服
<3-10,Amy>Sheldon, when I said couples costume,

107
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,430
<3-10,Amy>是指像罗密欧与朱丽叶
<3-10,Amy>I meant like Romeo and Juliet

108
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,540
<3-10,Amy>或是灰姑娘和白马王子
<3-10,Amy>or Cinderella and Prince Charming,

109
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,730
<3-10,Amy>而不是两个机器人
<3-10,Amy>not two robots

110
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,020
<3-10,Amy>而且我根本不喜欢那部白痴电影
<3-10,Amy>from some silly movie I don't even like.

111
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,900
<3-10,Amy>小心说话啊  同志
<3-10,Amy>Okay!

112
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,360
<3-11,Sheldon>这次我放过你
<3-11,Sheldon>I'm gonna let that slide

113
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,750
<3-11,Sheldon>就当你是要喝双茶包而昏了头
<3-11,Sheldon>because I know you're hopped up on tea bags.

114
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,600
<3-12,Amy>我总是为你牺牲自我
<3-12,Amy>I make compromises for you all the time.

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,850
<3-12,Amy>但就这一次
<3-12,Amy>Just this once,

116
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,940
<3-12,Amy>我们不能找个两个人都满意的方案吗
<3-12,Amy>can't we find something that we're both happy with?

117
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,560
<3-13,Sheldon>好吧  那打扮成20世纪
<3-13,Sheldon>Fine. How about one of the most beguiling

118
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,580
<3-13,Sheldon>最有吸引力和影响力的一对如何
<3-13,Sheldon>and influential couples of the 20th century?

119
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,590
<3-13,Sheldon>比尔·休利特和戴维·帕卡德是惠普(HP)公司创始人
<3-13,Sheldon>两者均为男性

120
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,590
<3-13,Sheldon>休利特和帕卡德
<3-13,Sheldon>Hewlett and Packard.

121
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,870
<3-13,Sheldon>我要扮休利特
<3-13,Sheldon>Dibs on Hewlett.

122
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,890
<3-13,Sheldon>干嘛  你想扮休利特吗
<3-13,Sheldon>What, you want to be Hewlett?

123
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,500
<4-1,Penny>有人在吗
<4-1,Penny>Anybody home?

124
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,510
<4-2,Leonard>稀客稀客啊  你来干嘛
<4-2,Leonard>Hey-hey-hey, what are you doing here?

125
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,850
<4-3,Penny>我只顺路过来跟你打声招呼
<4-3,Penny>I just thought I'd stop by and say hello.

126
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,650
<4-4,Leonard>真是个美好惊喜呀
<4-4,Leonard>Oh, what a nice surprise.

127
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,650
<4-4,Leonard>你从来没见过我的实验室吧
<4-4,Leonard>I don't think you've ever seen my lab before.

128
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,960
<4-5,Penny>对啊  早就该来了
<4-5,Penny>No, I know. It's long overdue.

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,760
<4-5,Penny>那你在干嘛呢
<4-5,Penny>So, what ya doing?

130
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,930
<4-5,Penny>最好不是在造机器人女友
<4-5,Penny>Better not be building a robot girlfriend.

131
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,320
<4-5,Penny>当然不是
<4-5,Penny>No.

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,460
<4-6,Leonard>不过霍华德在遇见伯纳黛特前
<4-6,Leonard>Although Howard was making some real strides

133
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,570
<4-6,Leonard>的确在那领域取得了不少进步
<4-6,Leonard>in that area until he met Bernadette.

134
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,880
<4-7,Penny>-什么  你在开玩笑吧  -没有
<4-7,Penny>- What? You're kidding. - Nope.

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,210
<4-8,Leonard>电子丽莎3000现在正乖乖待着箱子里
<4-8,Leonard>Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box

136
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,000
<4-8,Leonard>等着主人来电呢
<4-8,Leonard>waiting for the phone to ring.

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,520
<4-9,Penny>哇  这里面是什么呀
<4-9,Penny>Ooh! What's going on in here?

138
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,110
<4-10,Leonard>别别别  千万别打开看
<4-10,Leonard>Oh, no, no, no, don't look in there.

139
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,180
<4-11,Penny>干嘛  是秘密吗
<4-11,Penny>What, is it secret?

140
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,930
<4-12,Leonard>不  是氮激光器
<4-12,Leonard>No, it's a nitrogen laser.

141
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,860
<4-12,Leonard>看一眼  你的眼珠就会变成半熟的鸡蛋
<4-12,Leonard>It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.

142
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,210
<4-13,Penny>或许你该在箱子上标记一下
<4-13,Penny>Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.

143
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,570
<4-14,Leonard>标记在这里
<4-14,Leonard>Sign right there.

144
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,100
<4-15,Penny>"危险"  没错  没错
<4-15,Penny>Ah. "Danger," sure, sure.

145
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,120
<4-15,Penny>那个又是什么
<4-15,Penny>Yeah. What's, what's that?

146
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,690
<4-16,Leonard>那是集成离子阱
<4-16,Leonard>Uh, that is an integrated ion trap

147
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,640
<4-16,Leonard>和飞行时间质谱仪
<4-16,Leonard>and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

148
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,740
<4-17,Penny>哇  高科技含量
<4-17,Penny>Wow. High-techie-techie.

149
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,210
<4-17,Penny>那这个小玩意是什么
<4-17,Penny>What's this little box?

150
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,000
<4-18,Leonard>那是削铅笔机
<4-18,Leonard>That is a pencil sharpener.

151
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,760
<4-19,Penny>哦  低科技含量
<4-19,Penny>Ooh, low-techie-techie.

152
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,110
<4-19,Penny>那你现在在研究什么呢
<4-19,Penny>So, what are you working on right now?

153
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,650
<4-20,Leonard>-其实还蛮了不起的哦  -是吗
<4-20,Leonard>- It's actually pretty neat. - Yeah?

154
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,120
<4-22,Leonard>是啊  这是正投影全息显示
<4-22,Leonard>Yeah. It's a front-projected holographic display

155
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,650
<4-22,Leonard>加上手指激光跟踪器
<4-22,Leonard>combined with laser-based finger tracking.

156
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,030
<4-22,Leonard>来  我给你演示
<4-22,Leonard>Here, I'll show you.

157
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,930
<4-22,Leonard>我们把铅笔放在这里
<4-22,Leonard>We'll just put this pencil over here.

158
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,890
<4-23,Penny>削得很尖  刚才的小玩意挺管用
<4-23,Penny>Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.

159
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,010
<4-24,Leonard>非常好
<4-24,Leonard>Very good.

160
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,540
<4-24,Leonard>然后激光会映射出反射面
<4-24,Leonard>And then a laser will map the reflective surface...

161
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,290
<4-24,Leonard>瞧瞧
<4-24,Leonard>and voil?

162
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,650
<4-25,Penny>哇  真是太不可思议了
<4-25,Penny>Wow. That is amazing.

163
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,480
<4-26,Leonard>弦理论中  有个基本概念
<4-26,Leonard>You know, there's a foundational idea in string theory

165
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,430
<4-26,Leonard>宇宙可能是一张全息图
<4-26,Leonard>that the whole universe may be a hologram.

166
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,260
<4-27,Penny>这话什么意思
<4-27,Penny>What do you mean?

167
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,840
<4-28,Leonard>全息原理提出的观点是
<4-28,Leonard>Well, the holographic principle suggests that

168
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,860
<4-28,Leonard>人类每天在三维空间感受的一切
<4-28,Leonard>what we all experience every day in three dimensions

169
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,540
<4-28,Leonard>可能只是宇宙最遥远的地方的
<4-28,Leonard>may really just be information

170
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,130
<4-28,Leonard>全息投影
<4-28,Leonard>on a surface located

171
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,470
<4-28,Leonard>我们感受到的宇宙其实是外界的信息
<4-28,Leonard>at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.

172
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,970
<4-28,Leonard>所以有可能我们的生活
<4-28,Leonard>So it's possible that our lives are

173
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,020
<4-28,Leonard>真的只是在宇宙这张
<4-28,Leonard>really just acting out a painting

174
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,320
<4-28,Leonard>最大的画布上表演绘画而已
<4-28,Leonard>on the largest canvas in the universe.

175
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,490
<4-30,Leonard>怎么了
<4-30,Leonard>What?

176
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,670
<4-31,Penny>有时我会忘了你有多聪明
<4-31,Penny>Sometimes I forget how smart you are.

177
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,520
<4-32,Leonard>你真应该经常来
<4-32,Leonard>You should visit more often.

178
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,250
<4-32,Leonard>你要干嘛
<4-32,Leonard>What are you doing?

179
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,910
<4-33,Penny>把衣服脱掉
<4-33,Penny>Take off your clothes.

180
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,690
<4-34,Leonard>现在啊  在这里吗
<4-34,Leonard>What? Here? Now?

181
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,710
<4-35,Penny>-对  你有意见吗  -没有没有
<4-35,Penny>- Yeah. You got a problem with that? - No, no.

182
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,130
<4-36,Leonard>真是疯狂啊
<4-36,Leonard>It's kind of crazy.

183
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,820
<4-36,Leonard>我从来没再实验室搞过
<4-36,Leonard>I've never fooled around in the lab before.

184
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,200
<4-37,Penny>-真的没有吗  -有
<4-37,Penny>- Really? Never? - No.

185
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,180
<4-38,Leonard>我跟电子丽莎试过
<4-38,Leonard>I did have a shot with the Lisatronic,

186
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,710
<4-38,Leonard>但是她的电源延长线不够长
<4-38,Leonard>but the extension cord wasn't long enough.

187
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,860
<5-1,Raj>趁我还没忘  我想听听你们
<5-1,Raj>Before I forget, I'd like your opinion on the menus

188
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,030
<5-1,Raj>对万圣节菜单的意见
<5-1,Raj>I've prepared for the Halloween party.

189
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,990
<5-1,Raj>主题是"怪兽食物"
<5-1,Raj>The theme is "Food that goes bump in the night."

190
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,230
<5-2,Howard>"黑森林火腿湖怪兽"
<5-2,Howard>"Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon."

192
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,010
<5-3,Raj>酷斯拉芝麻面包
<5-3,Raj>On Sesame seed Bunzillas.

193
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,730
<5-4,Sheldon>"死蓉面包之夜"
<5-4,Sheldon>"Night of the Living Garlic Bread"?

194
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,840
<5-5,Raj>笑点在"面包"音似"死亡"[英语]
<5-5,Raj>It's funny because "bread" sounds like "dead."

195
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,310
<5-6,Sheldon>抱歉  但这些都是普通的食物
<5-6,Sheldon>I'm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods

196
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,140
<5-6,Sheldon>不过是名字换成无聊的双关语
<5-6,Sheldon>with the names bent into tortured puns.

197
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,110
<5-6,Sheldon>菜色本身完全没有万圣节的感觉
<5-6,Sheldon>The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.

198
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,590
<5-7,Raj>万圣节的感觉[万圣香肠]
<5-7,Raj>Ooh, Hallow-weenies!

199
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,050
<5-7,Raj>这双关取得不错
<5-7,Raj>That's a good one.

200
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,070
<5-7,Raj>这个跟我的"吸血鬼通心粉"很搭
<5-7,Raj>They'll pair nicely with my "Draculoni and Cheese."

201
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,640
<5-7,Raj>我真是天才啊
<5-7,Raj>How do I do it?!

202
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,680
<5-8,Howard>我突然想起  我打算
<5-8,Howard>That reminds me, I was thinking about

203
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,370
<5-8,Howard>穿我的太空衣去
<5-8,Howard>wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume.

204
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,650
<5-8,Howard>但我觉得大家可能会说
<5-8,Howard>But then I realized everyone would be, like,

205
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,590
<5-8,Howard>"你的化装服呢
<5-8,Howard>"Where's your costume?

206
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,350
<5-8,Howard>为什么你穿工作服来啊  傻子"
<5-8,Howard>Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?"

207
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,470
<5-9,Leonard>伙计们  好呀
<5-9,Leonard>Hello, boys.

208
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,770
<5-10,Sheldon>你在笑什么
<5-10,Sheldon>What are you smiling at?

209
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,780
<5-11,Leonard>没什么
<5-11,Leonard>Nothing.

210
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,620
<5-12,Howard>你们知道哪里什么都没有吗
<5-12,Howard>You know where's there's a lot of nothing.

211
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,410
<5-12,Howard>太空嘛
<5-12,Howard>Space.

212
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,860
<6-1,Howard>天啊  睡在床上不浮起来的感觉真好
<6-1,Howard>Boy, it's nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again.

213
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,020
<6-1,Howard>我有告诉过你  某晚我的牙保持器
<6-1,Howard>Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out

214
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,910
<6-1,Howard>飘出我的嘴巴  飘进密封舱里吗
<6-1,Howard>of my mouth and into the air lock?

215
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,700
<6-2,Bernadette>有  你提过一两次吧
<6-2,Bernadette>Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.

216
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,070
<6-3,Howard>我们终于团聚
<6-3,Howard>So, here we are,

217
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,100
<6-3,Howard>好一对新婚小夫妻
<6-3,Howard>just a couple of young newlyweds.

218
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,490
<6-3,Howard>做点什么好呢
<6-3,Howard>What to do?

219
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,380
<6-3,Howard>对  你  做  点  什  么  好
<6-3,Howard>What to do to you?

220
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,120
<6-3,Howard>宇航员沃罗威茨  上床报到
<6-3,Howard>Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty.

221
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,920
<6-3,Howard>"推进器"准备
<6-3,Howard>Preparing thrusters.

222
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,000
<6-3,Howard>"火箭"成功升空
<6-3,Howard>We have liftoff.

223
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,510
<6-3,Howard>睡袍是否能"脱离"了
<6-3,Howard>Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?

224
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,170
<6-4,Bernadette>够了  我们得谈谈了
<6-4,Bernadette>Okay, we need to talk.

225
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,830
<6-5,Howard>谈什么
<6-5,Howard>What?

226
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,450
<6-6,Bernadette>华仔  我知道你登上了太空
<6-6,Bernadette>Howie, I know you went to space.

227
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,400
<6-6,Bernadette>我由衷地为你骄傲
<6-6,Bernadette>I'm incredibly proud of you.

228
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,700
<6-6,Bernadette>可你最好不要
<6-6,Bernadette>But you might want to try

229
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,460
<6-6,Bernadette>老把这件事挂在嘴边
<6-6,Bernadette>and not bring it up every minute.

230
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,010
<6-7,Howard>我没有总是提这事啊
<6-7,Howard>I don't talk about it every minute.

231
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,430
<6-8,Bernadette>今晚吃饭时你就聊了整整一个小时
<6-8,Bernadette>Tonight at dinner you went on about it for an hour straight.

232
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,250
<6-9,Howard>那不然聊什么
<6-9,Howard>What was I supposed to talk about?

233
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,100
<6-9,Howard>那餐馆叫约翰"火箭"啊
<6-9,Howard>We were eating at Johnny Rockets.

234
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,890
<6-10,Bernadette>我是说  大家都有点厌倦这话题了
<6-10,Bernadette>I'm just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.

235
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,970
<6-11,Howard>所以我完成了如此壮举
<6-11,Howard>So, I did this amazing thing

236
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,680
<6-11,Howard>还不准我念叨两句了吗
<6-11,Howard>and I'm never allowed to mention it?

237
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,040
<6-12,Bernadette>你当然可以提
<6-12,Bernadette>Of course you can.

238
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,340
<6-12,Bernadette>但更好的方式是
<6-12,Bernadette>But maybe a good rule would be

239
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,580
<6-12,Bernadette>等别人先提起这件事
<6-12,Bernadette>to wait for people to bring it up.

240
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,570
<6-13,Howard>好  没问题
<6-13,Howard>Okay, no problem.

241
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,740
<6-13,Howard>我不会再主动聊了
<6-13,Howard>It won't happen again.

242
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,270
<6-14,Bernadette>我爱你
<6-14,Bernadette>I love you.

243
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,610
<6-14,Bernadette>我也爱你
<6-14,Bernadette>I love you, too.

244
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,140
<6-15,Howard>你都不知道我做过多少次
<6-15,Howard>I can't tell you how many times I dreamed

245
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,910
<6-15,Howard>和你同床的梦  当我在...
<6-15,Howard>I was in bed here with you when I was...

246
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,390
<6-15,Howard>你懂的
<6-15,Howard>you know.

247
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,280
<6-15,Howard>怎么  连指一下也不行吗
<6-15,Howard>What, I can't even point?

248
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,140
<7-1,Leonard>总的来说  这就是所谓的磁悬浮技术
<7-1,Leonard>So, basically, this is what's called maglev technology.

249
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,520
<7-1,Leonard>运用超强的电磁体
<7-1,Leonard>It uses very powerful electromagnets

250
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,320
<7-1,Leonard>制造出能对抗重力的磁悬浮力
<7-1,Leonard>to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity.

251
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,760
<7-1,Leonard>拿着这个
<7-1,Leonard>Here, you hold this.

252
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
<7-2,Penny>-好重啊  -没错
<7-2,Penny>- Whoa! That's heavy. - Yeah.

253
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,120
<7-3,Leonard>你没带什么珠宝首饰吧
<7-3,Leonard>Oh, uh, you don't have on any jewelry, do you?

254
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,230
<7-4,Penny>没带  怎么了
<7-4,Penny>No. Why?

255
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,500
<7-5,Leonard>上次有个研究生忘了摘"环"
<7-5,Leonard>A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings.

256
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,550
<7-5,Leonard>如今他在排队等着
<7-5,Leonard>Now he's on a transplant list

257
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,650
<7-5,Leonard>移植和他匹配的乳头呢
<7-5,Leonard>waiting for a nipple his size.

258
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,370
<7-5,Leonard>看好了
<7-5,Leonard>Now watch this.

259
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,260
<7-6,Penny>真是太酷了
<7-6,Penny>That is very cool.

260
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,930
<7-7,Leonard>有时候我会开启仪器
<7-7,Leonard>Sometimes I like to turn this on

261
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,930
<7-7,Leonard>然后假装我是无敌坏蛋万磁王
<7-7,Leonard>and pretend I'm the super villain Magneto.

262
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,070
<7-8,Penny>你这么说就不酷了  莱纳德
<7-8,Penny>It's getting a little less cool, Leonard.

263
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,320
<7-9,Leonard>其实我只是一个特别聪明的科学家
<7-9,Leonard>But what I really am is a very smart scientist

264
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,150
<7-9,Leonard>身怀宇宙力学知识
<7-9,Leonard>who understands the mechanics of the universe

265
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,140
<7-9,Leonard>身穿你买的性感黑色小裤裤
<7-9,Leonard>and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.

266
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,260
<7-10,Penny>这就对了
<7-10,Penny>There we go.

267
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,270
<8-1,Raj>我觉得这次派对的拍照间
<8-1,Raj>So, I thought the photo booth for the party

268
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,510
<8-1,Raj>可以布置成恐怖的木乃伊之墓
<8-1,Raj>could either be creepy like a mummy's tomb,

269
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,570
<8-1,Raj>或者是《神秘博士》里的塔迪斯一样也不错
<8-1,Raj>or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.

270
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,540
<8-2,Sheldon>塔迪斯可不行
<8-2,Sheldon>A Tardis makes no sense.

271
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,410
<8-2,Sheldon>它是科幻小说里的时间机器
<8-2,Sheldon>It's a time machine from a science-fiction show.

272
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,980
<8-2,Sheldon>和万圣节扯不上关系
<8-2,Sheldon>It has nothing to do with Halloween.

273
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,220
<8-2,Sheldon>尽管如此  如果你不搞个塔迪斯来
<8-2,Sheldon>That being said, if you don't get a Tardis,

274
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,240
<8-2,Sheldon>你和你的派对就弱爆了
<8-2,Sheldon>you stink and your party stinks.

275
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,470
<8-3,Raj>你喜欢哪一种
<8-3,Raj>Do you have a preference?

276
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,820
<8-4,Howard>无所谓  就塔迪斯吧
<8-4,Howard>I don't care. Get the Tardis.

277
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,810
<8-5,Sheldon>太好了  这次派对一定超好玩
<8-5,Sheldon>Yes! This party just became a major rager.

278
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,100
<8-6,Raj>对了  我能借一下你的皮鞭和软呢帽吗
<8-6,Raj>Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?

279
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,060
<8-7,Howard>行啊  随便你
<8-7,Howard>Yeah, sure, whatever.

280
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,430
<8-8,Raj>我想打扮成
<8-8,Raj>I was thinking of dressing up as

281
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,910
<8-8,Raj>印第安纳·琼斯的棕皮肤私生子
<8-8,Raj>Indiana Jones' mocha-skinned love child.

282
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,920
<8-8,Raj>印度·琼斯
<8-8,Raj>"Indian" Jones.

283
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,750
<8-9,Howard>很有哏
<8-9,Howard>Clever.

284
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,680
<8-10,Raj>你怎么了
<8-10,Raj>What's wrong with you?

285
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,840
<8-11,Howard>没怎么呀
<8-11,Howard>Nothing.

286
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,130
<8-12,Raj>霍华德  我还得策划派对呢
<8-12,Raj>Oh, Howard, I've got a party to plan.

287
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,220
<8-12,Raj>别让我费劲逼问你了
<8-12,Raj>Don't make me pull it out of you.

288
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,080
<8-13,Howard>好吧  说就说
<8-13,Howard>Okay, here it is.

289
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,700
<8-13,Howard>伯纳黛特说你们都特别烦我
<8-13,Howard>Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me

290
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,620
<8-13,Howard>老提上太空的事
<8-13,Howard>talking about my trip to space.

291
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,060
<8-13,Howard>这是真的吗
<8-13,Howard>Is that true?

292
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,550
<8-14,Sheldon>-不是  -是
<8-14,Sheldon>- No. - Yes.

293
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,050
<8-16,Sheldon>我俩的处理方式貌似相左啊
<8-16,Sheldon>We seem to have different approaches here.

294
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,630
<8-16,Sheldon>我是准备诚实地帮助他
<8-16,Sheldon>I was going for helpful honesty.

295
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,740
<8-16,Sheldon>你这是什么招数呢
<8-16,Sheldon>I have no idea what you're doing.

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,890
<8-17,Raj>我这叫当好人
<8-17,Raj>It's called being nice.

<8-18,Sheldon>好吧  如果你当好人
<8-18,Sheldon>Okay. If you think being nice

298
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,460
<8-18,Sheldon>就可以让他闭嘴  那我也当好人吧
<8-18,Sheldon>will get him to shut up, I'll try it.

299
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,540
<8-19,Howard>好了各位  没关系的
<8-19,Howard>You know what, guys? Never mind.

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,050
<8-19,Howard>我再也不提我这辈子最伟大的成就
<8-19,Howard>I just won't talk about the greatest achievement
