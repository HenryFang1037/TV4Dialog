39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,490

<2-5,Howard>才不用我来取呢
<2-5,Howard>I don't get to pick it.

73
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,630

<2-13,Sheldon>"Readiness: unsatisfactory.

74

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,320
<2-13,Sheldon>是否带有情绪：牢骚略多

76
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,390
<2-13,Sheldon>综上所述
<2-13,Sheldon>Overall:

77
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,530
<2-13,Sheldon>他不仅会在灾难中死得很惨
<2-13,Sheldon>not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno,

78
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,920
<2-13,Sheldon>他旷日持久的牢骚会毁掉别人的好心情"
<2-13,Sheldon>his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else's day."

79
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,990
<2-14,Leonard>我太累了  脑子都不转了
<2-14,Leonard>You know what, I'm so tired, I can't even think straight.

80
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,160

<2-14,Leonard>你们哪位愿意待会儿送这位二逼青年回家
<2-14,Leonard>Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?

82
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,660
<2-14,Leonard>你不能回去
<2-14,Leonard>You can't go home.

<2-15,Sheldon>你四点钟还得送我去看牙医
<2-15,Sheldon>You have to take me to the dentist at 4:00.

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,130
<2-16,Leonard>你就不能自己坐公交去吗
<2-16,Leonard>Oh... can't you take the bus to the dentist?

85
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,050
<2-17,Sheldon>我当然能  问题是回来的时候
<2-17,Sheldon>Of course I can. It's coming back,

86
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,010
<2-17,Sheldon>有麻醉剂的后续作用
<2-17,Sheldon>under the residual effects of the anesthesia,

87
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,910
<2-17,Sheldon>这才是麻烦的地方
<2-17,Sheldon>that's the problem.

88
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,070
<2-17,Sheldon>两年前
<2-17,Sheldon>Two years ago,

89
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,890
<2-17,Sheldon>在一次全面牙龈清洗过后  我以为我上了公交车
<2-17,Sheldon>after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus

90
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,780
<2-17,Sheldon>醒来却发现自己在墨西哥烈酒游行团车上
<2-17,Sheldon>but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.

91
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,470
<2-18,Raj>你洗个牙龈都得打麻药啊
<2-18,Raj>They put you under for a cleaning?

92
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,400
<2-19,Sheldon>没办法  我急起来会咬人
<2-19,Sheldon>Yeah, they have to-- I'm a biter.

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,970
<2-20,Leonard>我不管了  谢尔顿  我累得不行了
<2-20,Leonard>Whatever, Sheldon. I'm exhausted.

94
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,490
<2-20,Leonard>我没法带你去看牙医了
<2-20,Leonard>I'm not taking you to the dentist.

95
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,510
<2-21,Sheldon>不行啊  哥们儿
<2-21,Sheldon>Wrong, sir.

96
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,870
<2-21,Sheldon>不行  根据室友协议的第37条B款
<2-21,Sheldon>Wrong. Under Section 37-B of the Roommate Agreement--

97
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,160
<2-21,Sheldon>"杂项职责"  你有义务
<2-21,Sheldon>"Miscellaneous Duties"-- you are obligated

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,310
<2-21,Sheldon>带我去看牙医
<2-21,Sheldon>to take me to the dentist.

99
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,610
<2-21,Sheldon>看到了吧  就在"为可能坏掉的乳制品
<2-21,Sheldon>See? It's right here after "providing a confirmation sniff

100
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,610
<2-21,Sheldon>提供气味确认"这条的后面
<2-21,Sheldon>on questionable dairy products."

101
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,360
<2-22,Leonard>你挺好  我受够了室友协议
<2-22,Leonard>You know what, I am sick of the Roommate Agreement.

102
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,060
<2-22,Leonard>傻透了
<2-22,Leonard>It's ridiculous.

103
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,250
<2-22,Leonard>我是你的室友  不是你的司机
<2-22,Leonard>I'm your roommate, not your chauffeur.

104
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,810
<2-22,Leonard>我昨天本来有别的事情要做
<2-22,Leonard>You know, I had better things to do yesterday

105
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,640
<2-22,Leonard>结果却得载你去加登格罗夫的一家
<2-22,Leonard>than drive you all the way to the "good" model train store

106
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,700
<2-22,Leonard>"不错"火车模型店  就因为帕萨迪纳的那家
<2-22,Leonard>in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena

107
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,340
<2-22,Leonard>"服务态度太傲慢了"
<2-22,Leonard>has gotten "too big for its britches."

108
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,180
<2-23,Sheldon>确实很傲慢
<2-23,Sheldon>Well, it has.

109
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,820
<2-23,Sheldon>你去问问啊
<2-23,Sheldon>Ask anybody.

110
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,780
<2-24,Leonard>我才不管呢  我受够了
<2-24,Leonard>I don't care. I'm done.

111
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
<2-25,Sheldon>等下
<2-25,Sheldon>Hold on.

112
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,290
<2-25,Sheldon>你是说你想使用第209条吗
<2-25,Sheldon>Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?

113
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,330
<2-26,Leonard>我不知道那条是啥
<2-26,Leonard>I don't know what that is,

114
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,680
<2-26,Leonard>但如果那条能让我回家睡觉的话  我就用
<2-26,Leonard>but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.

115
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,010
<2-27,Sheldon>你先想清楚
<2-27,Sheldon>Think carefully here.

116
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,490
<2-27,Sheldon>第209条会终止我们的友谊
<2-27,Sheldon>Clause 209 suspends our friendship,

117
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,290
<2-27,Sheldon>并解除室友协议  仅剩一些基本条款
<2-27,Sheldon>and strips down the Roommate Agreement to its bare essentials.

118
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,120
<2-27,Sheldon>我们对彼此的义务仅限于交房租  共用生活设施
<2-27,Sheldon>Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,070
<2-27,Sheldon>和在大厅里见面时出于认识
<2-27,Sheldon>and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition

120
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,250
<2-27,Sheldon>而冷漠地抬个头
<2-27,Sheldon>as we pass in the hall.

121
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,350
<2-27,Sheldon>哟
<2-27,Sheldon>'Sup?

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,880
<2-28,Leonard>我要在哪签名
<2-28,Leonard>Where do I sign?

123
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,040
<2-29,Sheldon>就这里
<2-29,Sheldon>Right here.

124
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,650
<2-29,Sheldon>用手指即可
<2-29,Sheldon>Use your finger.

125
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,590
<2-30,Leonard>-签好了  -好的  到此结束
<2-30,Leonard>- There. Done. - All right. That's it.

126
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,460
<2-31,Sheldon>从此你走你的阳关道

<2-31,Sheldon>源自《玩具总动员》的主题曲
<2-31,Sheldon>"You've got a friend in me[我是你的好朋友]"

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,540
<2-31,Sheldon>"我不是你的好朋友"
<2-31,Sheldon>"You have not got a friend in me."

<3-8,Sheldon>I would've been here sooner,

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,500
<3-8,Sheldon>可那巴士老是停下来载客

<3-12,Sheldon>You're my girlfriend

158
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,210
<3-12,Sheldon>居然不迎合我的每一个需求
<3-12,Sheldon>and you're not going to cater to my every need?

161
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,160
<3-13,Penny>不过  她们真正的用处你也用不到
<3-13,Penny>Although, you don't use them for what they're for,

162
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,860
<3-13,Penny>所以我也不知道了
<3-13,Penny>so what do I know?

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,650
<3-14,Bernadette>霍华德就不会叫我帮他买东西
<3-14,Bernadette>Howard doesn't make me do his shopping

164
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,930
<3-14,Bernadette>送他去看牙医

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,540
<3-14,Bernadette>帮他拿干洗的衣服  对吧
<3-14,Bernadette>or pick up his dry cleaning, right?

239
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,080

<5-11,Howard>It has to come from the other astronauts.

246
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,170
<5-12,Raj>也许有办法让别人想到这个
<5-12,Raj>Maybe there's a way to get them to come up with it.

247
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,590
<5-13,Howard>比如呢
<5-13,Howard>Like how?

248
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,850
<5-14,Leonard>我以前试过带着个邓肯溜溜球
<5-14,Leonard>Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo,

249
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,530
<5-14,Leonard>希望其他孩子会叫我邓肯
<5-14,Leonard>hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.

250
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,090
<5-15,Howard>成功了吗
<5-15,Howard>Did it work?

251
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,780
<5-16,Leonard>没有  他们最后叫我袜子嘴
<5-16,Leonard>No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth.

252
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,480
<5-16,Leonard>因为他们抢走了我的溜溜球
<5-16,Leonard>Because they took away my yo-yo

253
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,270
<5-16,Leonard>还把他们的袜子塞进我嘴里
<5-16,Leonard>and stuffed their socks in my mouth.

254
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,400
<5-17,Raj>好吧  要是我们把"火箭客"做你手机铃声
<5-17,Raj>Okay, uh, what if we make "Rocket Man" your ringtone,

255
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,900
<5-17,Raj>下次你和那些宇航员说话的时候
<5-17,Raj>and the next time you talk to those guys,

256
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,460
<5-17,Raj>我就打电话给你  让他们听到
<5-17,Raj>I'll call you and they'll hear it.

257
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,810
<5-17,Raj>埋下心理暗示的种子
<5-17,Raj>Plant the seed.

258
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,050
<5-18,Howard>这个计划还真不赖
<5-18,Howard>That's actually not a terrible plan.

259
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,520
<5-19,Raj>哥的"劲爆巧克力"外号可不是白叫的
<5-19,Raj>They don't call me "Brown Dynamite" for nothing.

260
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,070
<5-20,Leonard (to Sheldon, entering)>哟
<5-20,Leonard (to Sheldon, entering)>'Sup?

261
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,720
<5-21,Sheldon>哟
<5-21,Sheldon>'Sup?

262
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,940
<5-22,Leonard>你有没有去看牙医呀
<5-22,Leonard>Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?

263
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,240
<5-23,Sheldon>没必要了
<5-23,Sheldon>Not necessary. No.

264
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,040
<5-23,Sheldon>我找到一项服务  他们会派辆车来你家
<5-23,Sheldon>I found a service that'll send a van to your house

265
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,190
<5-23,Sheldon>为你洗牙
<5-23,Sheldon>for a teeth cleaning.

266
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,420
<5-23,Sheldon>他们大多为狗服务  不过
<5-23,Sheldon>Mostly they cater to dogs, but...

267
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,990
<5-23,Sheldon>接电话的那个人还算思想开放
<5-23,Sheldon>...the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.

268
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,010
<5-24,Leonard>好吧  谢尔顿
<5-24,Leonard>All right, Sheldon,

269
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,420
<5-24,Leonard>如果你要我开车送你去看牙医
<5-24,Leonard>if you need me to take you to the dentist,

270
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,310
<5-24,Leonard>我会送你去的
<5-24,Leonard>I will take you to the dentist.

271
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,890
<5-25,Sheldon>这么说你是意识到了
<5-25,Sheldon>Are you suggesting that you've come to your senses

272
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,580
<5-25,Sheldon>并且想要重新接受室友协议
<5-25,Sheldon>and wish to reestablish the mutual benefits that stem

273
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,940
<5-25,Sheldon>恢复我们之间的互惠互助吗
<5-25,Sheldon>from full participation in the Roommate Agreement?

274
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,910
<5-25,Sheldon>当然了
<5-25,Sheldon>Absolutely.

275
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,470
<5-26,Leonard>只要你承认你都三十岁了
<5-26,Leonard>If you admit that you're a 30-year-old man

276
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,440
<5-26,Leonard>还没法自己一个人独立生活
<5-26,Leonard>who's incapable of functioning on his own.

277
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,910
<5-27,Raj>矮油  袜子嘴先生让他下不来台了
<5-27,Raj>Ooh, Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.

278
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,050
<5-28,Sheldon>我才不会承认这种事情
<5-28,Sheldon>I will admit nothing of the sort.

279
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,540
<5-28,Sheldon>现在我要失陪了
<5-28,Sheldon>And now if you'll excuse me,

280
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,480
<5-28,Sheldon>我要打电话给我牙医
<5-28,Sheldon>I have to call my dentist and see

281
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,240
<5-28,Sheldon>看他是不是也能帮我洗个头发剪个指甲
<5-28,Sheldon>if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.

282
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,050
<6-1,Penny (entering)>太好了  你这里也断电了
<6-1,Penny (entering)>Oh, good, your power's out, too.

283
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,270
<6-2,Leonard>这算哪门子好
<6-2,Leonard>Why is that good?

284
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,590
<6-3,Penny>因为上个月
<6-3,Penny>Because last month,

285
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,980
<6-3,Penny>我给电力公司寄了张星巴克礼品卡
<6-3,Penny>I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card,

286
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,270
<6-3,Penny>一封道歉信  和一些我穿着胸罩的照片
<6-3,Penny>an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.

287
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,700
<6-4,Sheldon>断电了
<6-4,Sheldon>Power failure.

288
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,910
<6-4,Sheldon>启动断电应急预案
<6-4,Sheldon>Implementing power-failure protocol.

289
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,600
<6-5,Leonard>你不是在地板上画了夜光逃生路线么
<6-5,Leonard>What happened to all your glow- in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff

290
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,320
<6-5,Leonard>怎么没了
<6-5,Leonard>you had painted on the floor?

291
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,500
<6-6,Sheldon>那玩意儿致癌
<6-6,Sheldon>Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic.

292
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,110
<6-6,Sheldon>不管怎样
<6-6,Sheldon>Anyway...

293
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,660
<6-6,Sheldon>你失去了我互助互惠的友谊
<6-6,Sheldon>it's too bad you're no longer entitled

294
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,650
<6-6,Sheldon>真是太不幸了
<6-6,Sheldon>to the full benefits of my friendship,

295
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,160
<6-6,Sheldon>因为我刚好为应付这种情况
<6-6,Sheldon>because I happen to be extremely prepared

296
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,400
<6-6,Sheldon>做了充分的准备
<6-6,Sheldon>for such an emergency.

297
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,140
<6-6,Sheldon>拜托你别借着这个灯光看东西
<6-6,Sheldon>Please try not to see anything by this light.

298
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,250
<6-6,Sheldon>这灯光不借外人用
<6-6,Sheldon>It's not for you.

299
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,200
<6-7,Leonard>这只是断电  我肯定马上就恢复了
<6-7,Leonard>It's just a blackout; I'm sure the power will be back on soon.

300
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,420
<6-8,Sheldon>唐纳组织里的某些白痴
<6-8,Sheldon>And I'm sure some fool in the Donner party

301
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,540
<6-8,Sheldon>唐纳组织:  美国早期拓荒者组织
<6-8,Sheldon>拓荒旅途中因遭遇暴雪被困  发生了人吃人的惨剧

302
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,540
<6-8,Sheldon>也说过雪马上就会停呢
<6-8,Sheldon>said the snow would stop any day now.

303
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,520
<6-8,Sheldon>我希望他们先吃了他
<6-8,Sheldon>I like to think they ate him first.

304
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,280
<6-9,Penny>我公寓里有些蜡烛
<6-9,Penny>You know, I got some candles in my apartment.

305
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,000
<6-10,Sheldon>蜡烛  现在可是在断电
<6-10,Sheldon>But candles?! During a blackout?!

306
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,750
<6-10,Sheldon>你疯了吗  那会有着火的危险
<6-10,Sheldon>Are you mad? That's a fire hazard.

307
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,800
<6-10,Sheldon>不  帕萨迪纳水电公司推荐使用
<6-10,Sheldon>No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends

308
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,140
<6-10,Sheldon>更安全的荧光棒
<6-10,Sheldon>the far safer glow stick.

309
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,240
<6-11,Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre)>你那玩意也敢叫荧光棒
<6-11,Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre)>You call that a glow stick?

310
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,970
<6-11,Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre)>这才是荧光棒
<6-11,Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre)>That is a glow stick.

311
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,940
<6-11,Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre)>来吧  我们走
<6-11,Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre)>Come on, let's go.

312
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,880
<6-12,Sheldon>等等  考虑下这个
<6-12,Sheldon>Before you go, consider this.

313
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,420
<6-12,Sheldon>我不但有深循环的海军陆战队电池
<6-12,Sheldon>Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source

314
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,650
<6-12,Sheldon>这能更好地支持
<6-12,Sheldon>which is more than capable

315
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,990
<6-12,Sheldon>我们的娱乐活动

<6-12,Sheldon>if you're willing to reinstate the Roommate Agreement.

321
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,060
<6-13,Penny>我家有酒  我们还可以摁泡泡塑料包装
<6-13,Penny>I've got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.

322
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,390
<6-14,Sheldon>他会回来的
<6-14,Sheldon>Oh, he'll be back.

323
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,980
<6-14,Sheldon>和一个女孩在黑暗里喝酒
<6-14,Sheldon>Wine and a girl in the dark--

324
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,830
<6-14,Sheldon>他肯定会无聊死的
<6-14,Sheldon>he's gonna be bored out of his mind.

325
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,110
<7-1,Leonard>敬美酒和泡泡包装
<7-1,Leonard>To wine and bubble wrap.

326

<7-1,Leonard>他怎么用反向渗透机

328
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,950
<7-1,Leonard>把尿转换成饮用水
<7-1,Leonard>that converts urine into drinking water.

329
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,760
<7-2,Penny>知道吗  在女孩子童子军里
<7-2,Penny>You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dineesha said

330
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
<7-2,Penny>苔米·戴妮莎说  你用丝袜就可以这么做
<7-2,Penny>you could do that with panty hose.

331
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,820
<7-2,Penny>天啊  那才叫错的离谱
<7-2,Penny>Boy, was she wrong.

332
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,210
<7-4,Penny>不说了  你想来亲热一下吗
<7-4,Penny>Anyway, you want to make out?

333
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,610
<7-3,Leonard>我们的关系不是在测试中吗
<7-3,Leonard>I thought because our relationship's in a beta test,

334
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,650
<7-3,Leonard>我以为你想慢慢来
<7-3,Leonard>you wanted to take things slow.

335
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,560
<7-3,Leonard>好吧
<7-3,Leonard>Okay.

336
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,170
<7-4,Penny>你想慢慢地来亲热吗
<7-4,Penny>Do you want to make out slow?

337
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,700
<7-5,Leonard>我可以慢得像是蜗牛在你嘴里爬
<7-5,Leonard>I can go so slow it'll be like there's a snail in your mouth.

338
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,740
<7-6,Penny>算你走运  反正现在也没其他事好干
<7-6,Penny>Well, lucky for you, there's nothing else to do right now.

339
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,470
<7-7,Sheldon>不好意思  莱纳德
<7-7,Sheldon>Excuse me, Leonard.

340
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,020
<7-8,Leonard>你打什么时候开始不敲门的
<7-8,Leonard>Since when don't you knock?

341
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,930
<7-8,Leonard>这差不多是你唯一的优点了
<7-8,Leonard>It's like the only good thing about you.

342
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,150
<7-9,Sheldon>这可不是讲究社交礼仪的时候  莱纳德
<7-9,Sheldon>Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard.

343
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,890
<7-9,Sheldon>现在可是紧急情况
<7-9,Sheldon>We're in a state of emergency.

344
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,770
<7-9,Sheldon>整个世界陷入黑暗动乱之中
<7-9,Sheldon>The world has descended into darkened turmoil.

345
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,440
<7-9,Sheldon>现在就必须目无法纪  野蛮行事
<7-9,Sheldon>Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.

346
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,050
<7-10,Leonard>好吧  什么事
<7-10,Leonard>Fine, what is it?

347
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,690
<7-11,Sheldon>我在做烤棉花糖
<7-11,Sheldon>I'm making s'mores.

348
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,480
<7-11,Sheldon>我是想来预先警告你
<7-11,Sheldon>I wanted to alert you

349
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,620
<7-11,Sheldon>以免你闻到烤棉花糖的教堂香味
<7-11,Sheldon>in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows

350
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,330
<7-11,Sheldon>会以为是附近的糖果厂着火了
<7-11,Sheldon>and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.

351
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,350
<7-12,Leonard>烤棉花糖是吧  你厉害
<7-12,Leonard>S'mores, huh? Good for you.

352
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,100
<7-13,Sheldon>要变成"我们"真厉害也行
<7-13,Sheldon>Yes, or good for us

353
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,550
<7-13,Sheldon>只要你在这签名
<7-13,Sheldon>if you sign here

354
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,680
<7-13,Sheldon>恢复我们原来的室友协议就行了
<7-13,Sheldon>and reinstate the full Roommate Agreement.

355
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,080
<7-14,Leonard>不用了  谢谢  这样就行了
<7-14,Leonard>No, thanks. I'm good.

356
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,100
<7-14,Leonard>真的吗
<7-14,Leonard>Really?

357
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,790
<7-15,Sheldon>好吧
<7-15,Sheldon>Huh! Okay.

358
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,520
<7-15,Sheldon>这样的话  我就自己独享烤棉花糖了
<7-15,Sheldon>In that case, I will have a s'more by myself.

360
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,500
<7-15,Sheldon>然后我就会做出更多
<7-15,Sheldon>And then I'm gonna have s'more.

361
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,050
<7-15,Sheldon>独立完成
<7-15,Sheldon>By myself.

362
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,750
<7-17,Leonard>别可怜他
<7-17,Leonard>No, don't "aw" him.

363
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,280
<7-17,Leonard>这一切都是他搞出来的
<7-17,Leonard>He brought this all on himself.

364
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,330
<7-18,Penny>但他现在很可怜
<7-18,Penny>But he's sad.

365
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,590
<7-19,Leonard>不  他在发疯
<7-19,Leonard>No, he's crazy.

366
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,120
<7-19,Leonard>有时候发疯看着很可怜
<7-19,Leonard>Sometimes crazy looks like sad

367
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,920
<7-19,Leonard>这样你才会重新上当
<7-19,Leonard>so it'll suck you back in.

368
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,930
<7-20,Penny>他是在想念自己的小伙伴吧
<7-20,Penny>I think he misses his little buddy.

369
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,580
<7-20,Penny>好吧
<7-20,Penny>Fine.

370
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,530
<7-21,Leonard>但记住我的话
<7-21,Leonard>But mark my words,

371
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,840
<7-21,Leonard>咱这场挫败的少年亲热大戏  可还没完
<7-21,Leonard>this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.

372
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,250
<8-1,Leonard>你不是说蜡烛很危险吗
<8-1,Leonard>I thought you said candles were dangerous.

374
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,140
<8-2,Sheldon>这是本生灯
<8-2,Sheldon>This is a Bunsen burner.

375
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,440
<8-2,Sheldon>我是科学家  知道自己在做什么
<8-2,Sheldon>I'm a scientist; I know what I'm doing.

376
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,890
<8-2,Sheldon>该死
<8-2,Sheldon>Oh, drat.

377
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,160
<8-2,Sheldon>我用了一加仑尿液才制出那杯水的
<8-2,Sheldon>It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.

378
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,820
<8-3,Leonard>谢尔顿  咱别做傻事了
<8-3,Leonard>Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid.

379
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,630
<8-3,Leonard>我们怎么就不能做朋友了
<8-3,Leonard>I don't see why we can't be friends.

380
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,090
<8-3,Leonard>我是很乐意载你出去
<8-3,Leonard>And I'm willing to drive you around

381
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,300
<8-3,Leonard>帮你办各种事务的
<8-3,Leonard>and help you out with stuff.

382
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,240
<8-3,Leonard>我只是不愿意
<8-3,Leonard>I just don't want to do it

383
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,350
<8-3,Leonard>为了什么傻帽室友协议才这样做
<8-3,Leonard>because of some silly Roommate Agreement.

384
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,890
<8-4,Sheldon>你有何提议
<8-4,Sheldon>What are you proposing?

385
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,030
<8-5,Leonard>我提议咱回到从前那样
<8-5,Leonard>That we go back to the way things were.

386
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,870
<8-5,Leonard>但在我为你做点事之后
<8-5,Leonard>But when I do something for you,

387
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,830
<8-5,Leonard>你应该表达出一点感激之情
<8-5,Leonard>you show a little appreciation.

388
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,850
<8-6,Sheldon>你想让我怎么表达
<8-6,Sheldon>And how would I do that?

389
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,040
<8-7,Leonard>你跟我说"谢谢你"
<8-7,Leonard>You say "thank you."

390
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,710
<8-8,Sheldon>每次都要说吗
<8-8,Sheldon>Every time?

391
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,780
<8-9,Leonard>这样不算疯狂
<8-9,Leonard>It's not crazy.

392
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,010
<8-10,Sheldon>我有反对意见
