1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,800
<1-1,Raj>先生们 我告诉你们哟
<1-1,Raj>Gentlemen,I put it to you:

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,830
<1-1,Raj>最难吃西米布丁也好过其他口味优质布丁
<1-1,Raj>the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavor.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,300
<1-2,Sheldon>首先 明眼人都知道这话错的 因为最好的布丁是巧克力口味
<1-2,Sheldon>First off,that is axiomatically wrong because the best pudding is chocolate.

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,360
<1-2,Sheldon>其次 西米的有机结构使布丁 黏糊糊摇晃晃 有潜在致命危险
<1-2,Sheldon>Secondly,the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,730
<1-2,Sheldon>是从植物里提取...
<1-2,Sheldon>It is extracted from the plant...

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,930
<1-3,Howard>嘿 我在考虑留点胡子
<1-3,Howard>Hey,I'm thinking of growing a mustache.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,150
<1-4,Leonard>不是吧?
<1-4,Leonard>No kidding?

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,160
<1-4,Leonard>傅满洲那样的? 八字胡 又尖又长?
<1-4,Leonard>Fu Manchu,a handlebar,pencil?

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,600
<1-5,Sheldon>- 是从植物中提取 - 还没想好呢
<1-5,Sheldon>- It's extracted from the plant. - I'm not sure yet.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,140
<1-6,Howard>乔治·克鲁尼现在也留胡子呢
<1-6,Howard>You know,George Clooney has one now.

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,930
<1-7,Raj>真的? 我看到过他在拉夫斯超市买龙舌兰酒
<1-7,Raj>Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph's. He was buying tequila.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,070
<1-8,Howard>你以为他们会有仆人跑腿买酒吗?
<1-8,Howard>You'd think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,580
<1-9,Leonard>好啦 太残忍了
<1-9,Leonard>All right,this is cruel.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,370
<1-9,Leonard>我们还是让他说完 不然人家要爆头了
<1-9,Leonard>We'd better let him finish before his head explodes.

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,490
<1-10,Howard>好吧 谢尔顿 为啥西...
<1-10,Howard>All right,Sheldon,why is tap...

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,030
<1-11,Sheldon>西米由食用木薯根茎提取而成
<1-11,Sheldon>Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta!

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,580
<1-11,Sheldon>由于富含高浓度的氰化物
<1-11,Sheldon>Due to a high concentration of cyanide,

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,180
<1-11,Sheldon>其本身有毒性 如加工不当即食用会致命
<1-11,Sheldon>it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly!

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,820
<1-12,Raj>现在爽了吧?
<1-12,Raj>Feel better now?

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,250
<1-13,Sheldon>同时可可豆也是巴西的 从中能提取巧克力 做最好的布丁
<1-13,Sheldon>It is also indigenous to Brazil as is the coa bean,from which we get chocolate,the best pudding.

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,150
<1-13,Sheldon>求你们别再耍我了!
<1-13,Sheldon>And you promised you wouldn't do that anymore!

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,300
<1-14,Kripke (arriving)>嘿 霍夫施塔特
<1-14,Kripke (arriving)>Hey,Hofstadter.

23
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,070
<1-15,Leonard>嘿 Kripke
<1-15,Leonard>Hey,Kripke.

24
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,720
<1-16,Kripke>听说你最新的反质子衰变实验了
<1-16,Kripke>Heard about your latest anti-proton decay experiment.

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,060
<1-16,Kripke>收集两万数据 却没啥有用的结果
<1-16,Kripke>20,000 data runs and no statistically significant results.

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,660
<1-16,Kripke>灰常了得
<1-16,Kripke>Very impressive.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,550
<1-17,Howard>蠢货一个
<1-17,Howard>What a jerk.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,060
<1-18,Raj>别气馁 莱纳德 没用的结果也是结果
<1-18,Raj>Don't feel bad,Leonard. Negative results are still results.

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,510
<1-19,Howard>- 就算两万又算啥 - 行啦!
<1-19,Howard>- Even 20,000 of them. - All right!

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,960
<1-20,Leonard>求你们别在给我打气了
<1-20,Leonard>Please don't cheer me up anymore.

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,280
<1-21,Howard>别呀 不要让他打击到你 Kripke哪根葱
<1-21,Howard>Come on. Don't let him get to you. It's Kripke.

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,270
<1-22,Raj>对呀 大蠢蛋一个
<1-22,Raj>Yeah,he's a ginormous knob.

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,610
<1-23,Howard>所以他孤单用餐 而不能坐到这酷酷的桌子来
<1-23,Howard>That's why he eats by himself instead of sitting here at the cool table.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,560
<1-24,Raj>说得对呀
<1-24,Raj>For shizzle.

35
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,860
<1-25,Sheldon>确实啊 Kripke确实缺乏 咱固有的那种基本社交技巧
<1-25,Sheldon>It's true Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,070
<1-25,Sheldon>但他还操控着新的开放科学网格计算机
<1-25,Sheldon>But he also controls the new open science grid computer

37
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,160
<1-25,Sheldon>而我需要它来模拟宇宙早期的结构形态
<1-25,Sheldon>that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.

38
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,710
<1-26,Leonard>看你有没有那命用上吧
<1-26,Leonard>Well,good luck getting time on it.

39
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,150
<1-26,Leonard>他可只让他的朋友使用
<1-26,Leonard>The only people he lets use it are his friends.

40
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,420
<1-27,Sheldon>那 解决办法很简单嘛
<1-27,Sheldon>Well,then,the solution is simple.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,260
<1-27,Sheldon>我去和他做朋友
<1-27,Sheldon>I shall befriend him.

42
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,720
<1-27,Sheldon>Kripke!
<1-27,Sheldon>Kripke!

43
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,400
<1-28,Kripke>啥事?
<1-28,Kripke>Yeah?

44
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,800
<1-29,Sheldon>你觉得我们交个朋友如何?
<1-29,Sheldon>What would you say to the idea of you and I becoming friends?

45
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,910
<1-30,Kripke>我觉得木有啥兴趣哟
<1-30,Kripke>I would say I have no interest in becoming your friend.

46
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,130
<1-30,Kripke>当真?
<1-30,Kripke>Really?

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,350
<1-31,Sheldon>你个里里外外不受欢迎的家伙 目光还真是相当短浅呀
<1-31,Sheldon>That seems rather shortsighted coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable.

48
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,000
<1-31,Sheldon>不如重新考虑下吧?
<1-31,Sheldon>Why don't you take some time to reconsider?

49
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,330
<1-32,Kripke>行呀 我去想想
<1-32,Kripke>Yeah,I'll do that.

50
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,040
<1-33,Sheldon>看来咱这开局不错啊
<1-33,Sheldon>Well,I think we're off to a terrific start.

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,440
<2-1,Leonard>好了
<2-1,Leonard>There you go.

52
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,840
<2-1,Leonard>现在所有沃尔伍兹发来的邮件 都会直接进入垃圾箱
<2-1,Leonard>Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.

53
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,840
<2-2,Penny>多谢 其实骚扰邮件倒没啥 他穿浴衣的度假照比较雷人
<2-2,Penny>Thanks. I mean,the e-mail doesn't bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,980
<2-3,Leonard>是呀 我也收到了 那可不是浴衣 是晒痕
<2-3,Leonard>Yeah,I got the same one,and that's not a bathing suit. It's a tan line.

55
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,700
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>你好 我是谢尔顿·库珀
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>Hello,this is Sheldon Cooper.

56
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,250
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>这是给贝瑞·克里帕奇的留言
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>I am leaving a message for Barry Kripke.

57
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,850
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>贝瑞 很高兴在食堂与你邂逅
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>Barry,it was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria.

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,230
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>我注意到你买了推荐沙拉
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>I saw that you purchased the chef's salad.

59
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,690
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>显然 你不知道推荐沙拉是 食堂的杂碎肉骗人把戏
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>Apparently,you did not know that the chef's salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat.

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,070
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>不过呢 我希望你用餐愉快
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>Nevertheless,I hope you enjoyed it.

61
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,060
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>我在追踪待定友谊的发展状况 期待你来电给它定位哟
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>I'm following up on our pending friendship and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status.

62
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,750
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>我是谢尔顿·库珀
<2-4,Sheldon (on phone)>Sheldon Cooper.

63
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,040
<2-5,Penny>胆小发明家又咋了?
<2-5,Penny>What's up with Ichabod?

64
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,490
<2-6,Leonard>他在交友呢
<2-6,Leonard>Uh,he's trying to make a new friend.

65
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,030
<2-7,Penny>真的? 不错嘛
<2-7,Penny>Oh,really? Well,good for him.

66
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,100
<2-8,Leonard>除非他像杰佩托做出皮诺曹 不然没戏的
<2-8,Leonard>Well,unless he makes one out of wood like Geppetto,I don't think it's gonna happen.

67
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,180
<2-9,Penny>那你们咋成为朋友的?
<2-9,Penny>How did you guys become friends?

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,250
<2-10,Leonard>大学公告板上的一张传单
<2-10,Leonard>There was a flyer on the bulletin board at the university:

69
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,950
<2-10,Leonard>"招募室友 吹口哨的勿扰"
<2-10,Leonard>"Roommate wanted.Whistlers need not apply."

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,950
<2-11,Penny>你就搬进去了?
<2-11,Penny>And you moved in anyway?

71
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,800
<2-12,Leonard>我以为他说着玩的
<2-12,Leonard>I assumed he was joking.

72
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,790
<2-12,Leonard>你绝对想不到有多少量子物理学家 都有反复无常的一面
<2-12,Leonard>You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,330
<2-13,Penny>霍华德和拉吉呢? 我是说他咋和他们好上的?
<2-13,Penny>What about Howard and Raj? I mean,how did he become friends with them?

74
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,410
<2-14,Leonard>不知道 碳原子是如何构成苯环的?
<2-14,Leonard>I don't know. How do carbon atoms form a benzene ring?

75
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,280
<2-14,Leonard>价电子亲近
<2-14,Leonard>Proximity and valence electrons.

76
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,270
<2-15,Penny>是呀 你这样说也是哈
<2-15,Penny>Well,sure,when you put it that way.

77
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,720
<2-15,Penny>但相处的也不错是吧
<2-15,Penny>But it all worked out,right?

78
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,160
<2-16,Leonard>差不多吧 尽管我很怀念口哨
<2-16,Leonard>I suppose. I do miss whistling,though.

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,610
<2-17,Penny>不是吧?
<2-17,Penny>Oh,come on. Really?

80
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,120
<2-18,Sheldon>警告一次
<2-18,Sheldon>First warning.

81
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,740
<3-1,Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) >佩妮 佩妮 佩妮
<3-1,Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) >Penny? Penny? Penny?

82
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,160
<3-1,Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) >给你的
<3-1,Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) >This is for you.

83
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,000
<3-2,Penny>你好 谢尔顿
<3-2,Penny>Hello,Sheldon.

84
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,300
<3-4,Penny>这是啥?
<3-4,Penny>What is this?

85
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,730
<3-5,Sheldon>我设计的调查表
<3-5,Sheldon>It's a questionnaire I devised.

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,770
<3-5,Sheldon>我和一位同事交友遇到点困难
<3-5,Sheldon>I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,000
<3-5,Sheldon>所以我想做些小调查 更好的了解 为什么我目前的朋友们喜欢我
<3-5,Sheldon>so I'm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.

88
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,570
<3-6,Penny>嗯 这个问题值得考虑
<3-6,Penny>Yes,well,that is a good question.

89
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,340
<3-6,Penny>但你确定这是最好的办法了?
<3-6,Penny>But is this really the best way to figure it out?

90
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,700
<3-7,Sheldon>问得好 社会学家很大程度是忽悠
<3-7,Sheldon>I agree. The social sciences are largely hokum.

91
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,240
<3-7,Sheldon>但又不能插一个电极到你的大脑 探测你对我友谊问题的反应
<3-7,Sheldon>But short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship,

92
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,010
<3-7,Sheldon>就这方法还凑合了
<3-7,Sheldon>this is the best I can do.

93
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,620
<3-8,Penny>好 "问题1: 按吸引力程度给 谢尔顿·库珀以下各方面排序
<3-8,Penny>Okay,"Question one: "Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper "in order of appeal:"

94
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,770
<3-8,Penny>聪明 洁癖 有趣 Java程序编写?"
<3-8,Penny>Intelligence;ruthless attention to hygiene;playfulness; JAVA applet writing"?

95
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,080
<3-9,Sheldon>也许头一个问题答案过分明显
<3-9,Sheldon>I know,I may have started out with a fairly obvious one;

96
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,770
<3-9,Sheldon>谁不知道我最吸引人的特质之一 有趣
<3-9,Sheldon>an aspect of my most appealing trait: playfulness.

97
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,850
<3-9,Sheldon>你直接把它排到1号吧
<3-9,Sheldon>Why don't you just go ahead and rank that number one?

98
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,600
<3-9,Sheldon>恐怕剩下的我不能指导你了
<3-9,Sheldon>I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest.

99
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,710
<3-9,Sheldon>用不了三个小时就可以完成
<3-9,Sheldon>It should take you no more than three hours.

100
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,380
<3-10,Penny>等下 这玩意儿有多少个问题呀?
<3-10,Penny>Well,wait. How many questions are on this thing?

101
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,810
<3-11,Sheldon>区区211个
<3-11,Sheldon>Only 211.

102
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,700
<3-11,Sheldon>别担心 为了照顾你 这份高中毕业就能读懂
<3-11,Sheldon>Don't worry. In deference to you,I kept them all at a high school graduate reading level.

103
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,560
<3-12,Penny>还得谢你 哥们儿
<3-12,Penny>Thanks,pal.

104
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,250
<3-13,Sheldon>客气啥...姐们儿
<3-13,Sheldon>You got it... buddy.

105
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,390
<3-14,Penny>谢尔顿 亲爱的 你有没有考虑过 通过让人开心来交友啊?
<3-14,Penny>Sheldon,honey,did you ever consider making friends by being,I don't know,pleasant?

106
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,820
<3-15,Sheldon>那当然是一个发人深思的假设
<3-15,Sheldon>Well,that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis.

107
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,620
<3-15,Sheldon>我看你论文写这题目好了
<3-15,Sheldon>May I suggest it as the topic for your essay?

108
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,180
<4-1,Sheldon>你的调查问卷 十分让人失望呀
<4-1,Sheldon>Your questionnaire,very disappointing.

109
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,010
<4-2,Leonard>我逢题必答呀 谢尔顿
<4-2,Leonard>I answered every question,Sheldon.

110
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,870
<4-3,Sheldon>你选择题很有规律嘛
<4-3,Sheldon>You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern:

113
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,150
<4-5,Sheldon>我怎么会发现不了?
<4-5,Sheldon>How could I not?

<4-6,Leonard>行行好 超过200个问题
<4-6,Leonard>Come on. There's over 200 questions.

115
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,430
<4-6,Leonard>看有些问题吧
<4-6,Leonard>And look at some of these things.

116
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,980
<4-6,Leonard>"谢尔顿之于友谊如同太空梭之于什么?"
<4-6,Leonard>"Sheldon is to camaraderie as the space shuttle is to blank?"

117
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,510
<4-7,Sheldon>这里有些适合的答案呀
<4-7,Sheldon>There are a number of acceptable answers.

118
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,730
<4-7,Sheldon>例如 C近地运输机
<4-7,Sheldon>For example,Near-Earth transport."

119
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,250
<4-7,Sheldon>但绝对不是B鳄梨种植工
<4-7,Sheldon>But certainly not Avocado rancher."

120
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,580
<4-7,Sheldon>你在论文里还说等到赛昂人接管地球 我在交友方面会更有运气
<4-7,Sheldon>And your essay suggesting that I'd have better luck making friends if I wait till the Cylons take over?

121
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,650
<4-7,Sheldon>请别
<4-7,Sheldon>Please.

122
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,700
<4-8,Leonard>等等 那篇我可是认真写的
<4-8,Leonard>Now hold on. I put some real work into that.

123
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,300
<4-9,Sheldon>是呀 可比沃尔伍兹好多了
<4-9,Sheldon>Yes,well,it's better than what Wolowitz did.

124
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,810
<4-9,Sheldon>他画了一个大阴囊的发情浣熊
<4-9,Sheldon>He drew a raccoon with what appears to be a distended scrotum.

125
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,340
<4-10,Leonard>还真有点可爱哟
<4-10,Leonard>It's kinda cute.

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,440
<4-10,Leonard>只要不看它那玩意儿
<4-10,Leonard>Until you get to the scrotum.

127
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,140
<4-11,Sheldon>我怎么会有希望建立新的友情关系?
<4-11,Sheldon>What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that

128
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,510
<4-11,Sheldon>现存的朋友们都舍不得用 他们漫长生命的少许小时来帮助我
<4-11,Sheldon>my current friends apparently could not take a few hours out of their lives to help me?

129
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,390
<4-12,Leonard>谢尔顿 我没打算为大蛋蛋浣熊说话
<4-12,Leonard>Sheldon,I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.

130
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,770
<4-13,Sheldon>我看不出你能做到
<4-13,Sheldon>Well,I don't see how you could.

131
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,690
<4-14,Leonard>我想说的是 或许你不能把 这些当作纯粹智力习题来对待
<4-14,Leonard>What I'm trying to say is that maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,420
<4-15,Sheldon>你什么意思?
<4-15,Sheldon>What do you mean?

133
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,010
<4-16,Leonard>还记得你怎么在网上学游泳吗?
<4-16,Leonard>Well,remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the Internet?

<4-18,Leonard>在地板上学的
<4-18,Leonard>On the floor.

136
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,740
<4-19,Sheldon>技巧是相通的
<4-19,Sheldon>The skills are transferable.

137
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,400
<4-19,Sheldon>我只是不想到水里去
<4-19,Sheldon>I just have no interest in going in the water.

138
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,990
<4-20,Leonard>那你为啥要学游泳呀?
<4-20,Leonard>Then why learn how to swim?

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,650
<4-21,Sheldon>冰盖在融化呀 莱纳德
<4-21,Sheldon>The ice caps are melting,Leonard.

<4-21,Sheldon>未来 游泳是不可避免的
<4-21,Sheldon>In the future,swimming isn't going to be optional.

141
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,620
<4-21,Sheldon>但你给了我灵感
<4-21,Sheldon>But you do bring up an interesting point.

142
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,570
<4-21,Sheldon>我用不着做新的研究
<4-21,Sheldon>I don't have to break new ground here.

143
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,990
<4-21,Sheldon>肯定很多研究结果是现存的
<4-21,Sheldon>I'm sure much of the research already exists.

144
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,790
<4-22,Leonard>不 不 我想说的是 如果你想学如何交友
<4-22,Leonard>No,no,my point is,if you want to learn how to make friends,

145
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,970
<4-22,Leonard>到咖啡店或者博物馆去
<4-22,Leonard>then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum.

<4-22,Leonard>认识些人 和他们交流
<4-22,Leonard>Meet people. Talk to them.

<4-25,Sheldon>I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friend-making.

152
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,880
<4-26,Leonard>你干嘛不直接躺地上 游过去呢?

<5-5,Sheldon>If it had been a friend,I'm available to fill the void.

<5-9,Sheldon>I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.

212
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,220
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>是因为我没为发展友情提出实际建议
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>because I hadn't offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship.

213
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,620

221
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,980
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>真的呀? 骑真马?
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>Really? On actual horses?

222
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,520
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>再说个兴趣爱好
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>Tell me another interest of yours.

223
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,860
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>抱歉 不到逼不得已 我才不下水游泳
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>I'm sorry. I have no desire to get in the water till I absolutely have to.

224
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,140
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>再说个兴趣爱好
<6-12,Sheldon (on phone)>Tell me another interest of yours.

225
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,090
<6-13,Leonard>哦这问题要无限循环下去了
<6-13,Leonard>Uh-oh,he's stuck in an infinite loop.

226
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,280
<6-14,Howard>我来搞定
<6-14,Howard>I can fix it.

227
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,480
<6-15,Sheldon>有意思 但口技不是个人娱乐项目吗?
<6-15,Sheldon>Interesting,but isn't ventriloquism by definition a solo activity?

228
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,680
<6-15,Sheldon>再说个兴趣爱好
<6-15,Sheldon>Yeah. Tell me another interest of yours.

229
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,370
<6-15,Sheldon>你喜不喜欢猴子呀?
<6-15,Sheldon>Is there any chance you like monkeys?

230
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,410
<6-15,Sheldon>你咋回事嘛? 人人都喜欢猴子
<6-15,Sheldon>What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys.

231
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,200
<6-15,Sheldon>别挂 Kripke
<6-15,Sheldon>Hang on,Kripke.

232
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,320
<6-15,Sheldon>没办法时 选择不太讨厌的项目
<6-15,Sheldon>A loop counter and an escape to the least objectionable activity.

233
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,380
<6-15,Sheldon>霍华德 聪明啊
<6-15,Sheldon>Howard,that's brilliant.

234
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,950
<6-15,Sheldon>你居然想到了
<6-15,Sheldon>I'm surprised you saw that.

235
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,600
<6-16,Howard>天呀 谢尔顿咋交不到朋友呢?
<6-16,Howard>Gee,why can't Sheldon make friends?

236
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,270
<6-17,Sheldon>好了 Kripke 你刚说那兴趣爱好 是我不太讨厌的
<6-17,Sheldon>All right,Kripke,that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable,

237
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,980
<6-17,Sheldon>我提议咱一起去玩
<6-17,Sheldon>and I would like to propose that we do that together.

238
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,300
<6-17,Sheldon>明天
<6-17,Sheldon>Tomorrow.

239
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,900
<6-17,Sheldon>是的 我付钱 好的 拜拜
<6-17,Sheldon>Yes,I'll pay. All right,good-bye.

240
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,240
<6-17,Sheldon>好啦 该学学攀岩了
<6-17,Sheldon>All right. Time to learn rock climbing.

241
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,650
<7-1,Sheldon>要知道 我超喜欢口技哟
<7-1,Sheldon>You know,I am a fan of ventriloquism.

242
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,380
<7-1,Sheldon>要不你我还有你的小假人去喝个热饮
<7-1,Sheldon>Maybe you,me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage.

243
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,690
<7-1,Sheldon>你喝时他表演
<7-1,Sheldon>He could talk while you drink.

244
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,260
<7-2,Kripke>不鸟 我想攀岩
<7-2,Kripke>Nope. I wanna climb some rocks.

245
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,180
<7-3,Sheldon>这家伙比在电脑上看起来大啊
<7-3,Sheldon>This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop.

246
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,410
<7-3,Sheldon>想看原始人怎么用骨头当武器呢
<7-3,Sheldon>One expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapons.

247
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,200
<7-4,Kripke>你恐高啊 库珀?
<7-4,Kripke>You afraid of heights,Cooper?

248
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,240
<7-4,Kripke>哪能啊 恐高完全不合理
<7-4,Kripke>Hardly. A fear of heights is illogical.

249
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,130
<7-5,Sheldon>然而害怕掉下来 才是有发展眼光的说法
<7-5,Sheldon>A fear of falling,on the other hand,is prudent and evolutionary.

250
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,830
<7-5,Sheldon>你说要巩固我们的友情 我最少要爬多高呀?
<7-5,Sheldon>What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship?

251
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,700
<7-6,Kripke>好啦 这开生日会呢 小盆友都爬
<7-6,Kripke>Come on,they have birthday parties here. Little kids climb this.

252
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,100
<7-7,Sheldon>小原始人吧
<7-7,Sheldon>Little kid hominids perhaps.

253
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,240
<7-7,Sheldon>你工作就干这点事啊? 父母一定很骄傲哈
<7-7,Sheldon>So is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.

254
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,460
<7-8,Kripke>- 来啊 库珀 - 来了 Kripke
<7-8,Kripke>- Let's go,Cooper. - I'm coming,Kripke.

255
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,440
<7-9,Sheldon>好的 绳子貌似很结实
<7-9,Sheldon>Okay,the harness seems to be secure.

256
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,150
<7-9,Sheldon>刚才有点不能自制 但网上说那是正常情况
<7-9,Sheldon>A small amount of incontinence just now,but the Web site said that's to be expected.

257
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:45,210
<7-9,Sheldon>也不咋难嘛 像是垂直游泳
<7-9,Sheldon>this isn't so bad. It's like vertical swimming.

258
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,570
<7-10,Kripke>嘿 瞧瞧 库珀 都爬到一半了
<7-10,Kripke>Hey,look at you,Cooper. You're almost halfway to the top.

259
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,900
<7-11,Sheldon>是吗?
<7-11,Sheldon>I am?

260
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,300
<7-11,Sheldon>我错了 我恐高
<7-11,Sheldon>I was wrong. It is a fear of heights.

261
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,540
<7-11,Sheldon>你还好吗 库珀?
<7-11,Sheldon>You all right there,Cooper?

262
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,790
<7-12,Sheldon>不太好
<7-12,Sheldon>Not really.

263
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,730
<7-12,Sheldon>感觉像是反正切曲线接近渐近线了
<7-12,Sheldon>I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that's approached an asymptote.

264
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,100
<7-13,Kripke>你是说你卡住了?
<7-13,Kripke>Are you saying you're stuck?

265
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,110
<7-14,Sheldon>反正切曲线接近渐近线 哪个字你不明白啊?
<7-14,Sheldon>What part of inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?

266
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,030
<7-15,Kripke>我都明白 我又不是白痴 接着爬啦
<7-15,Kripke>I understood all of it. I'm not a moron. Just keep going.

267
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,940
<7-16,Sheldon>我想我做不到
<7-16,Sheldon>Yeah,I don't think I can.

268
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,510
<7-17,Kripke>那就爬下去
<7-17,Kripke>Well,then climb back down.

269
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,810
<7-18,Sheldon>不行 更没可能了
<7-18,Sheldon>No,that doesn't seem any more likely.

270
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,710
<7-19,Kripke>你打算咋办 库珀?
<7-19,Kripke>What's your plan,Cooper?

271
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,600
<7-20,Sheldon>不能算是啥打算 我想我要晕菜了
<7-20,Sheldon>Well,it's not exactly a plan,but I think I'm going to pass out.

272
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,550
<8-1,Leonard>抱歉 咱再做一次行吗?
<8-1,Leonard>I'm sorry,can we please just do it one more time?

273
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,710
<8-2,Howard>好的 一二 一二三
<8-2,Howard>Okay. One,two,one,two,three,and...

274
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,370
<8-3,Leonard>小事一件 但真是怀念啊
<8-3,Leonard>It's a little thing,but you really do miss it.

275
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,510
<8-4,Sheldon>大家好
<8-4,Sheldon>Hello,everyone.

276
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,100
<8-4,Sheldon>我带新朋友贝瑞·克里帕奇回家吃饭了
<8-4,Sheldon>I brought my new friend Barry Kripke home for dinner.

277
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,690
<8-6,Kripke>你们也好啊
<8-6,Kripke>Hello to you,too.

278
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,810
<8-7,Leonard>攀岩怎样?
<8-7,Leonard>How was rock climbing?

279
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,600
<8-8,Kripke>他晕过去了
<8-8,Kripke>He passed out.

280
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,380
<8-8,Kripke>跟个意大利腊肠一样吊在那
<8-8,Kripke>Just hung there like a big salami.

281
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,570
<8-9,Sheldon>那 那 那是我的座
<8-9,Sheldon>Tha-tha-that's where I sit.

282
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,070
<8-10,Kripke>你还有固定座位呢? 咋这么怪捏
<8-10,Kripke>Ooh,you have a special spot? What kind of wacko are you?

283
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,160
<8-11,Howard>看你有多少时间
<8-11,Howard>How much time you got?

284
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,580
<8-12,Leonard>来点中餐?
<8-12,Leonard>You want some Chinese food?

285
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,210
<8-13,Kripke>太好了 有牙线没?
<8-13,Kripke>Terrific. Got any dental floss?

286
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,900
<8-14,Leonard>在洗手间
<8-14,Leonard>In the bathroom.

287
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,240
<8-15,Kripke>马上回来
<8-15,Kripke>Be right back.

288
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,460
<8-15,Kripke>吃中餐前要先把牙里的印度菜弄出来
<8-15,Kripke>I got to floss the Indian food out of my teeth if I'm gonna eat Chinese.

289
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,680
<8-16,Penny>谢尔顿 还好吗?
<8-16,Penny>Sheldon,are you okay?

290
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,240
<8-17,Sheldon>哦 好呀 全晕过去了 但值了
<8-17,Sheldon>Oh,yes,I pass out all the time,but it was worth it.

291
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,600
<8-17,Sheldon>我和Kripke的友情有了质的进展 但这也产生了一个尴尬的问题
<8-17,Sheldon>I've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke,which brings me to an awkward moment.

292
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,470
<8-18,Leonard>咋了?
<8-18,Leonard>What's that?

293
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,760
<8-19,Sheldon>维持五个朋友的友情太困难了 所以...
<8-19,Sheldon>Maintaing five friendships promises to be a Herculean task,so...

294
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,440
<8-19,Sheldon>我要开除你们其中一个
<8-19,Sheldon>I'm going to have to let one of you go.

295
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,550
<8-20,Howard>我 我 选我吧
<8-20,Howard>Me,me,let it be me.

296
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,150
<8-21,Sheldon>莱纳德 你是我的室友 我的出行工具
<8-21,Sheldon>Leonard,you are my roommate,my source of transportation,

297
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,160
<8-21,Sheldon>床单烘干后你会为我叠好
<8-21,Sheldon>and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer.

298
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,920
<8-21,Sheldon>你安全了
<8-21,Sheldon>You are safe.

299
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,750
<8-22,Leonard>- 能吹口哨不? - 别犯傻
<8-22,Leonard>- Can I whistle? - Don't be silly.

300
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:26,750
<8-23,Sheldon>霍华德 你没有博士学位 你的古龙水刺激感官
<8-23,Sheldon>Howard,you do not have a PhD; your cologne is an assault on the senses;

301
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,390
<8-23,Sheldon>犹太重大节日期间 你不能参与电子游戏
<8-23,Sheldon>and you're not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.

302
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,530
<8-24,Howard>我有罪啊 我淘汰了
<8-24,Howard>Guilty as charged. I'm out.

303
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,570
<8-25,Sheldon>不 你也安全
<8-25,Sheldon>No. You too are safe.

304
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,230
<8-26,Howard>哦 不是吧 我该怎么做呀?
<8-26,Howard>Oh,come on. What do I have to do?

305
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,970
<8-27,Penny>好了 我知道怎么个意思了
<8-27,Penny>Okay,you know what? I see where this is going.

306
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,560
<8-27,Penny>我不属于你们中的一员 我也不是科学家 直接告诉我...
<8-27,Penny>I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist,so just tell me...

307
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,630
<8-28,Sheldon>佩妮 佩妮 佩妮 你说的都对 但请听我说完
<8-28,Sheldon>Penny,Penny,Penny,everything you're saying is true,but please allow me to continue.

308
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,170
<8-30,Sheldon>拉吉 你被淘汰了
<8-30,Sheldon>Raj,you're out.

309
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,130
<8-27,Penny>问的好
<8-27,Penny>That's a good question.

310
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,120
<8-28,Sheldon>你的确为这个同类的小团体 注入了异域的文化
<8-28,Sheldon>While you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group,

311
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,440
<8-28,Sheldon>但你问卷的回答太闹心了
<8-28,Sheldon>your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.

312
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,920
<8-28,Sheldon>你怎么会觉得我最喜欢的氨基酸是谷氨酰胺?
<8-28,Sheldon>How could you for a moment think that my favorite amino acid is glutamine?

313
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,860
<8-29,Leonard>他写了赖氨酸 又改了
<8-29,Leonard>He had lysine,but changed it.

314
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,460
<8-30,Sheldon>早干啥了 拉吉
<8-30,Sheldon>Shoulda,woulda,coulda,Raj.

315
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,650
<8-31,Kripke>我喜欢在吃东西前打牙线 以便牙缝迎接新的食物
<8-31,Kripke>I like to floss before I eat so my gum pockets are open for new food.

316
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,170
<8-32,Penny>你好啊!
<8-32,Penny>Hello!

317
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,600
<8-33,Kripke>我以前怎会没注意到你?
<8-33,Kripke>How did I walk past you?

318
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,880
<8-34,Penny>- 我是贝瑞 - 佩妮
<8-34,Penny>- I'm Barry. - Penny.

319
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,450
<8-35,Kripke>呃 这名字不咋性感嘛
<8-35,Kripke>Eh,that's not a very hot name.

320
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,300
<8-35,Kripke>我要叫你罗姗
<8-35,Kripke>I'm going to call you Roxanne.

321
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,900
<8-35,Kripke>哦 饺子
<8-35,Kripke>Ooh,pot stickers.

322
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,520
<8-36,Howard>突然前 我变得如此优质了哈?
<8-36,Howard>Suddenly,I'm looking pretty good,huh?

323
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:58,980
<8-37,Sheldon>Kripke 我在想你能不能借我用用 开放科学网格计算机呢?
<8-37,Sheldon>So,Kripke,I was wondering if there's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer?

324
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,910
<8-39,Sheldon>- 不行 - 不行? 我们是朋友啊
<8-39,Sheldon>- No. - No? But we're friends.

325
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,580
<8-40,Kripke>抱歉 不行 我的盆友
<8-40,Kripke>I'm sorry. No,my friend.

326
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,160
<8-41,Sheldon>搞不懂了
<8-41,Sheldon>I'm confused.

327
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,080
<8-41,Sheldon>我以为你会让朋友用那机器的
<8-41,Sheldon>I was given to understand that you allow your friends time on the machine.

328
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,520
<8-42,Kripke>不 不是那么回事 有正式安排的 我做不了主
<8-42,Kripke>No,that's wrong. There's an official schedule. I have no control over it.

329
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,020
<8-43,Sheldon>看来整个尝试都是徒劳了
<8-43,Sheldon>Well,this entire endeavor seems to have been an exercise in futility.

330
