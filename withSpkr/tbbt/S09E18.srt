00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,570
<5-3,Leonard>《生活大爆炸》前情回顾
<5-3,Leonard>Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,290
<3-8,Howard>可能我还不确定
<3-8,Howard>I guess I'm still wondering

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,240
<3-9,Leonard>我跟艾米丽到底适不适合
<3-9,Leonard>if Emily and I are right for each other.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,070
<3-10,Sheldon>这不会跟喝咖啡的那个女生有关吧
<3-10,Sheldon>Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,080
<3-13,Leonard>你是说那位我魂萦梦牵的身心灵完美女神吗
<3-13,Leonard>You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about?

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,760
<3-14,Sheldon>谁知道啊
<3-14,Sheldon>Who can say?

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,460
<5-1,Howard>我必须想出超级赚钱的点子
<5-1,Howard>I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,740
<5-2,Sheldon>没理由不行啊
<5-2,Sheldon>There's no reason you can't.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,750
<5-3,Leonard>你说得倒容易
<5-3,Leonard>That's easy for you to say.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,430
<5-3,Leonard>你和谢尔顿已经想出了超流氦模型
<5-3,Leonard>You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,480
<5-3,Leonard>那只是研究
<5-3,Leonard>That's just research.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,140
<1-1,Howard>根本没机会用来赚钱
<1-1,Howard>We're never going to make any money from it.

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,420
<1-2,Sheldon>去他的氦  这杯子里的旁趣酒
<1-2,Sheldon>Forget helium-- the real superfluid

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,890
<1-3,Howard>才是真正的超流逼
<1-3,Howard>is the fruit punch in this mug.

15
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,280
<4-17,Raj>让我想起我爸的秘密
<4-17,Raj>It reminds me of my daddy's secret

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,420
<4-18,Emily>"不许告诉妈妈"果汁
<4-18,Emily>"Don't Tell Mama" Juice.

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,090
<4-19,Raj>这个主意也许行
<4-19,Raj>Maybe that's an idea.

18
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,270
<1-34,Leonard>给醉酒人士的导向系统
<1-34,Leonard>Guidance systems for drunk people.

19
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,030
<1-34,Leonard>早有了  叫优步叫车
<1-34,Leonard>They have that, it's called Uber.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,290
<1-34,Leonard>在你的过冷氦试验中
<1-34,Leonard>Hey, in your supercooled helium experiments,

21
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,410
<1-34,Leonard>创建过量子漩涡吗
<1-34,Leonard>did you create quantum vortices?

22
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,280
<3-1,Leonard>有  怎么了
<3-1,Leonard>Yeah, why?

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,650
<3-2,Howard>如果你建立一个导航系统
<3-2,Howard>Well, if you made a guidance system,

24
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,630
<3-3,Sheldon>是不是可以把漩涡当做螺旋仪使用
<3-3,Sheldon>couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?

25
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,760
<2-20,Penny>我从来没想过
<2-20,Penny>Wow. Never thought about that.

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,460
<2-21,Raj>而且由于是在量子态下
<2-21,Raj>And, since it's in a quantum state,

27
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,230
<4-5,Raj>就能保持无限持续
<4-5,Raj>it would maintain an infinite persistence.

28
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,680
<4-6,Amy>开创性启示  热带鸡尾酒
<4-6,Amy>Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,770
<4-7,Raj>这简直是最棒的一集
<4-7,Raj>Tell me this isn't like the

30
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,840
<4-7,Raj>《欲望都市》了
<4-7,Raj>best episode of Sex and the City.

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,290
<4-7,Raj>我忍不住要问
<4-7,Raj>Okay, I gotta ask--

32
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,670
<4-7,Raj>你为什么要戴个领结
<4-7,Raj>why are you wearing a bow tie?

33
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,210
<4-7,Raj>我从来没申请过专利
<4-7,Raj>I've never applied for a patent before.

34
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,740
<1-1,Howard>我想给人家留下好印象
<1-1,Howard>I wanted to make a good impression.

35
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,290
<1-2,Sheldon>给人家留下你是搞笑人物的印象吗
<1-2,Sheldon>Oh. Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,910
<1-3,Howard>你自己还是个工程师呢
<1-3,Howard>Yeah, well, you're an engineer.

37
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,310
<1-4,Sheldon>这就是笑话  呛死你
<1-4,Sheldon>End of joke, burn.

38
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,080
<1-5,Attorney>各位请进
<1-5,Attorney>Come on in, fellas.

39
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,720
<1-6,Howard>你看  他也没系领带
<1-6,Howard>See, he's not wearing a tie.

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,800
<1-7,Leonard>他是个专利律师
<1-7,Leonard>Well, he's a patent attorney.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,540
<1-7,Leonard>可能他的领带也还在等待审核中
<1-7,Leonard>Maybe his tie is pending.

42
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,610
<1-8,Attorney>我看了你们的文件
<1-8,Attorney>So, I've reviewed your paperwork,

43
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,540
<1-9,Sheldon>看起来我们申请专利需要的文件都齐全了
<1-9,Sheldon>and it seems like we've got everything we need to file a patent

44
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,470
<1-10,Howard>就是你们的无限持续陀螺仪
<1-10,Howard>for your infinite persistence gyroscope.

45
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,590
<1-10,Howard>-太好了  -太棒了
<1-10,Howard>- That's great! - Excellent.

46
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,920
<1-11,Leonard>下一步是什么
<1-11,Leonard>So what happens next?

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,460
<1-12,Attorney>我们的法律团队会检查
<1-12,Attorney>Well, the legal team needs to review

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,390
<1-12,Attorney>来避免与已注册专利重复
<1-12,Attorney>existing patents to avoid overlap.

49
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,980
<1-13,Howard>我觉得不会有
<1-13,Howard>Oh, I don't think there will be.

50
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,630
<1-14,Leonard>因为我们自己研究搜过了
<1-14,Leonard>Yes, we did our own search.

51
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,020
<1-15,Attorney>挺好  但我觉得我们团队做得会更仔细
<1-15,Attorney>That's nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.

52
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,510
<1-16,Sheldon>这家伙好傻好天真
<1-16,Sheldon>Get a load of this guy.

53
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,900
<1-17,Howard>能想象我们用这玩意大赚一票吗
<1-17,Howard>Can you imagine if we make money with this?

54
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,390
<1-18,Leonard>真的发财了  我就要挥霍
<1-18,Leonard>If we do, I am splurging

55
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,510
<1-18,Leonard>去买市面上最贵的鼻腔冲洗器
<1-18,Leonard>on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,550
<1-19,Howard>悲催的老故事
<1-19,Howard>That old sad story--

57
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,700
<1-19,Howard>某些人赚到点小钱  就都花鼻子里去了[吸粉]
<1-19,Howard>guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,760
<1-20,Attorney>只需要你们看看  然后签这份同意书
<1-20,Attorney>Just need you to review and sign this document

59
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,060
<1-20,Attorney>表示你们知道这项专利的所有权
<1-20,Attorney>acknowledging that you understand the university

60
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,240
<1-20,Attorney>有75%归学校所有
<1-20,Attorney>will own 75% of the patent.

61
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,900
<1-20,Attorney>75%吗
<1-20,Attorney>75%?

62
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,370
<1-22,Sheldon>这也太扯了
<1-22,Sheldon>That's outrageous.

63
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,120
<1-22,Sheldon>这个点子是基于我们自己的研究
<1-22,Sheldon>This is our idea based on our research.

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,230
<1-22,Sheldon>你们哪来的理占绝大半的股份啊
<1-22,Sheldon>How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?

65
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,250
<1-23,Attorney>大学政策就是这样
<1-23,Attorney>It's university policy.

66
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,310
<1-24,Sheldon>我输了  我服
<1-24,Sheldon>I know when I'm beat.

67
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,680
<1-25,Leonard>等等  等等  所以我们三个
<1-25,Leonard>Hold on, hold on. So the three of us

68
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,040
<1-25,Leonard>干了所有的活儿  却只能分到25%吗
<1-25,Leonard>do all the work and only end up with 25%?

69
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,800
<1-26,Attorney>霍夫斯塔德博士  本大学
<1-26,Attorney>Dr. Hofstadter, this university

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,110
<1-26,Attorney>付了你超过10年的薪水了
<1-26,Attorney>has been paying your salaries for over ten years.

71
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,950
<1-26,Attorney>你觉得我们这么做是因为善心大发吗
<1-26,Attorney>Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?

72
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,920
<1-27,Leonard>你说出这狠话之前  是有点这么以为
<1-27,Leonard>Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.

73
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,960
<1-28,Attorney>至于沃罗威茨先生
<1-28,Attorney>And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned,

74
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,830
<1-28,Attorney>你作为一个从太空总署出借的联邦雇员
<1-28,Attorney>I'm afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA,

75
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,460
<1-28,Attorney>你的名字是可以出现在专利上
<1-28,Attorney>your name can be on the patent,

76
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,290
<1-28,Attorney>但你无资格拿所有权股份
<1-28,Attorney>but you're not entitled to an ownership share.

77
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,860
<1-29,Howard>所以  这个可能大赚特赚的东西
<1-29,Howard>Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success,

78
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,690
<1-29,Howard>我屁都捞不着吗
<1-29,Howard>and I get nothing?

79
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,770
<1-30,Attorney>有时候会给你颁发奖牌啊
<1-30,Attorney>Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.

80
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,480
<1-31,Sheldon>这太不公平了
<1-31,Sheldon>Well, that's not fair.

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,350
<1-31,Sheldon>起码我们仨一人一个奖牌吧
<1-31,Sheldon>We should all get plaques.

82
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,160
<1-32,Leonard>抱歉  我们不能签这同意书
<1-32,Leonard>Sorry, but we can't sign this.

83
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,440
<1-33,Howard>走吧  我们走
<1-33,Howard>Come on, let's go.

84
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,260
<1-34,Leonard>打扰了
<1-34,Leonard>Thank you for your time.

85
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,570
<1-35,Sheldon>对奖牌我几个问题...
<1-35,Sheldon>Couple of questions about the plaque...

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,960
<2-1,Amy>你现在会有孕吐吗
<2-1,Amy>So, have you been having any morning sickness?

97
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,830
<2-1,Amy>稍微有点
<2-1,Amy>A little.

98
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,330
<2-2,Bernadette>而我的嗅觉提高也真够给我添乱
<2-2,Bernadette>And it doesn't help that I've got this heightened sense of smell.

99
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,730
<2-3,Penny>这是因为怀孕变这样的吗
<2-3,Penny>Is that a pregnancy thing?

100
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,550
<2-3,Penny>是啊
<2-3,Penny>Yeah.

101
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,740
<2-4,Bernadette>之前我就闻出了
<2-4,Bernadette>The other day I sniffed out

102
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,700
<2-4,Bernadette>华仔把慈善女童军饼干藏哪儿了
<2-4,Bernadette>where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies.

103
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,150
<2-4,Bernadette>再也不吃巧克力夹心个屁
<2-4,Bernadette>No more Tagalongs, my ass.

104
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,080
<2-5,Penny>但至少你现在
<2-5,Penny>But now you'll be able to make

105
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,230
<2-5,Penny>可以自己做出配饼干喝的奶啦
<2-5,Penny>your own milk to eat the cookies with.

106
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,660
<2-6,Raj>各位好  佩妮
<2-6,Raj>Hey, guys. Hey, Penny.

107
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,890
<2-6,Raj>我真的很谢谢你愿意帮我这个忙
<2-6,Raj>I really appreciate you helping me with this.

108
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,830
<2-6,Raj>我真不知该怎么办了
<2-6,Raj>I don't know what to do.

109
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,880
<2-7,Penny>没事  让我看看
<2-7,Penny>Oh, sure. Let me see it.

110
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,750
<2-8,Amy>看什么
<2-8,Amy>See what?

111
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,010
<2-9,Raj>自从跟艾米丽分手后  我就没跟她联系过
<2-9,Raj>I hadn't spoken to Emily since I broke up with her,

112
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,750
<2-9,Raj>她在我家门口留下这个与字条
<2-9,Raj>and she left this on my doorstep with a note.

113
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,660
<2-10,Penny>"拉杰  我在分手前给你买的  不能退货了
<2-10,Penny>"Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn't return it

114
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,070
<2-10,Penny>我觉得你会想要它
<2-10,Penny>And thought you'd like to have it.

115
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,590
<2-10,Penny>迟来的情人节快乐  艾米丽"
<2-10,Penny>Happy belated Valentine's Day, Emily."

116
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,700
<2-11,Bernadette>真好
<2-11,Bernadette>That's nice.

117
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,780
<2-12,Penny>是好  还是想左右他的思想
<2-12,Penny>Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?

118
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,240
<2-13,Raj>对啊  我是该拆开呢  还是还她呢
<2-13,Raj>I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?

119
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,690
<2-14,Amy>你干嘛不拆开
<2-14,Amy>Why wouldn't you open it?

120
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,770
<2-15,Raj>她当时挺生气的
<2-15,Raj>Well, she was pretty mad.

121
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,580
<2-15,Raj>很有可能是一个代表我的巫毒娃娃
<2-15,Raj>For all I know it's a voodoo doll of me

122
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,440
<2-15,Raj>然后小鸡鸡被叉子插住
<2-15,Raj>with a fork stuck in my junk.

123
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,390
<2-16,Bernadette>你不会真觉得她会送给你
<2-16,Bernadette>You don't think she'd actually send you something

124
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,630
<2-16,Bernadette>恶心或危险的东西吧
<2-16,Bernadette>gross or dangerous, do you?

125
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,280
<2-17,Penny>有个办法可以知道  闻吧
<2-17,Penny>I know one way to find out-- sniff this.

126
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,050
<2-18,Amy>她只是怀孕  不是侦探猎犬
<2-18,Amy>She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.

127
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,240
<2-19,Bernadette>我闻到了一点机油味
<2-19,Bernadette>Although I am getting a little machine oil.

128
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,940
<2-19,Bernadette>我猜是金属类
<2-19,Bernadette>I think it's metal.

129
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,570
<2-20,Penny>来吧  拆开它
<2-20,Penny>Come on, just open it.

130
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,990
<2-21,Raj>在《权力的游戏》里
<2-21,Raj>You know, on Game of Thrones,

131
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,600
<2-21,Raj>巴隆·葛雷乔伊就收到装盒子里的他儿子的鸡鸡
<2-21,Raj>Balon Greyjoy received his son's genitals in a box.

132
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,860
<2-22,Penny>多一根  有备无患
<2-22,Penny>Well, never hurts to have a spare.

133
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,910
<2-23,Bernadette>这是什么
<2-23,Bernadette>What is that?

134
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,260
<2-24,Raj>这是个古董六分仪
<2-24,Raj>It's an antique sextant.

135
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,430
<2-24,Raj>水手使用这个配合星星来确认自身方位
<2-24,Raj>Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.

136
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,650
<2-25,Amy>真是个送天体物理学家的好礼物
<2-25,Amy>What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.

137
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,030
<2-26,Raj>对啊  她真有心思
<2-26,Raj>I know, she's so thoughtful.

138
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,580
<2-27,Penny>你看  她是想拐你回去
<2-27,Penny>See, she's trying to get you back.

139
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,280
<2-27,Penny>要是我  我也会买这个送你
<2-27,Penny>Now, that is exactly what I would've gotten you

140
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,510
<2-27,Penny>前提是我知道这是什么  还有你职业
<2-27,Penny>if I had any idea what it is or what you do.

141
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,120
<2-28,Raj>小爷我的自尊不容许这姑娘
<2-28,Raj>You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl

142
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,680
<2-28,Raj>用让我心怀愧疚的方式跟她复合
<2-28,Raj>guilt me into getting back together with her.

143
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,180
<2-29,Amy>不用怀孕  我的嗅觉都闻得出这屁话的味儿
<2-29,Amy>You don't need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.

144
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,440
<3-1,Leonard>如果我们绕开大学
<3-1,Leonard>Well, what if we go around the university

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,050
<3-1,Leonard>自己申请专利呢
<3-1,Leonard>and just get the patent ourselves?

146
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,100
<3-2,Howard>不行  大学网站上有明文规定
<3-2,Howard>We can't. It says on their Web site,

147
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,040
<3-2,Howard>只要我们在这里工作  我们想出的所有点子
<3-2,Howard>as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,150
<3-2,Howard>他们都有控股权
<3-2,Howard>of anything we come up with.

149
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,730
<3-3,Sheldon>这下好了  我T恤的点子也归他们了
<3-3,Sheldon>Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt

150
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,030
<3-3,Sheldon>那件印着"蠢如一麻袋地质学家"的T恤
<3-3,Sheldon>that says "Dumb as a Bag of Geologists."

151
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,510
<3-4,Leonard>我们要么跟学校合作申请专利
<3-4,Leonard>Well, our choices are we do this with the university

152
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,770
<3-4,Leonard>要么就彻底放弃
<3-4,Leonard>or we don't do it at all.

153
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,180
<3-5,Howard>反正不管怎样  我啥都捞不着
<3-5,Howard>Either way, I get nothing.

154
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,400
<3-6,Leonard>又或者如果我们最后靠这个赚钱了
<3-6,Leonard>Or, if we ended up making money from this,

155
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,520
<3-6,Leonard>我和谢尔顿可以把我们的份额分给你
<3-6,Leonard>Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.

156
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,450
<3-7,Sheldon>先说清楚
<3-7,Sheldon>To be clear,

157
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,030
<3-7,Sheldon>莱纳德说的是陀螺仪
<3-7,Sheldon>Leonard is referring to the gyroscope,

158
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,500
<3-7,Sheldon>不是T恤和马克杯
<3-7,Sheldon>not the T-shirt and mugs.

159
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,310
<3-7,Sheldon>靠  马克杯也归他们了
<3-7,Sheldon>Oh! Now they own the mugs.

160
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,170
<3-8,Howard>这也不失为一种解决办法
<3-8,Howard>I guess that is a way around this.

161
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,920
<3-8,Howard>你们俩愿意这么做吗
<3-8,Howard>You guys would be cool doing it like that?

162
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,270
<3-9,Leonard>当然  任何利益我们都可以分成三份
<3-9,Leonard>Of course, we can split any profits three ways.

163
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,240
<3-10,Sheldon>我无所谓
<3-10,Sheldon>I'm fine with that.

164
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,190
<3-11,Howard>好的  太棒了
<3-11,Howard>Okay, great.

165
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,170
<3-12,Sheldon>听起来...此处该有合同要签
<3-12,Sheldon>It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.

166
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,590
<3-13,Leonard>当然  我们可以写份合同
<3-13,Leonard>Sure, we could write something up.

167
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,550
<3-14,Sheldon>但写合同这种活该谁来干呢
<3-14,Sheldon>But which one of us should be the party who...

168
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,540
<3-15,Howard>你来吧  谢尔顿
<3-15,Howard>You can do it, Sheldon.

169
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,750
<3-16,Sheldon>就这么愉快地决定了
<3-16,Sheldon>So stipulated!

170
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,730
<3-17,Leonard>有一我在他床底发现他藏的一叠合同[黄书]
<3-17,Leonard>Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed.

171
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,620
<3-17,Leonard>真是太诡异了
<3-17,Leonard>It was weird.

172
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,270
<4-1,Bernadette>真好奇这玩意花了她多少钱
<4-1,Bernadette>I wonder how much she spent on this.

173
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,110
<4-2,Amy>那我们来查查
<4-2,Amy>Ooh, let's find out.

174
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,840
<4-3,Raj>钱不重要
<4-3,Raj>It doesn't matter.

175
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,130
<4-3,Raj>重要的是心意
<4-3,Raj>It's the thought that counts.

176
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,640
<4-4,Penny>是是是  重要的是内在美
<4-4,Penny>Yeah, yeah, and beauty's on the inside,

177
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,360
<4-4,Penny>胖瘦不重要  她花了多少钱
<4-4,Penny>size doesn't matter-- how much she spend?

178
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,810
<4-5,Raj>真的啦  我不想知道
<4-5,Raj>Seriously, guys, I don't want to know.

179
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,520
<4-6,Amy>老天
<4-6,Amy>Oh, my.

180
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,530
<4-7,Raj>拜托  你不能感叹完不告诉我啊
<4-7,Raj>Oh, come on, you can't say "Oh, my," and then not tell me!

181
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,520
<4-8,Amy>这玩意至少值500块
<4-8,Amy>These things go for $500 and up.

182
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,470
<4-9,Bernadette>靠
<4-9,Bernadette>Damn.

183
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,130
<4-9,Bernadette>我收到的情人节礼物只是一张明信片
<4-9,Bernadette>All I got for Valentine's Day was a postcard

184
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,230
<4-9,Bernadette>上面写着我的泰迪熊会延迟发货
<4-9,Bernadette>saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.

185
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,510
<4-10,Penny>好吧  所以她留下一份500块的礼物
<4-10,Penny>Okay, so, she drops off a $500 gift

186
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,500
<4-10,Penny>会有可能不是想要跟你复合吗
<4-10,Penny>and she's not trying to get back together with you?

187
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,820
<4-11,Raj>或许你说得对
<4-11,Raj>Maybe you're right.

188
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,290
<4-12,Bernadette>又或者艾米丽说的是事实  只是出于好心
<4-12,Bernadette>Or she's telling the truth and just being nice.

189
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,430
<4-11,Raj>或许你说得对
<4-11,Raj>Maybe you're right.

190
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,560
<4-13,Raj>哇  我真的很容易被人左右
<4-13,Raj>Wow, I am easy to manipulate.

191
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,750
<4-13,Raj>姑娘们  是艾米丽
<4-13,Raj>Oh, guys, it's Emily.

192
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,520
<4-13,Raj>我该怎么办
<4-13,Raj>What should I do?

193
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,110
<4-14,Penny>接吧  立场要坚定
<4-14,Penny>Okay, answer it. Just be strong.

194
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,960
<4-14,Penny>如果她开始哭  千万别答应任何事
<4-14,Penny>And if she starts to cry, don't make any promises.

195
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,250
<4-14,Penny>最重要的是  开免提让我们都能听见
<4-14,Penny>And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.

196
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,930
<4-15,Raj>喂
<4-15,Raj>Hello?

197
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,350
<4-16,Emily (voice)>我是艾米丽
<4-16,Emily (voice)>Hey, it's Emily.

198
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,460
<4-16,Emily (voice)>现在方便说话吗
<4-16,Emily (voice)>Is this a good time?

199
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,870
<4-17,Raj>方便  有什么事吗
<4-17,Raj>Yeah, yeah. Sure. What's up?

200
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,590
<4-18,Emily>我留那个礼物你不介意吧
<4-18,Emily>Was it okay I left that gift?

201
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,350
<4-18,Emily>我真的很希望我们能做朋友
<4-18,Emily>I'm really hoping we can be friends.

202
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,580
<4-19,Raj>或许吧
<4-19,Raj>Maybe, maybe.

203
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,580
<4-20,Emily>你想一起喝杯咖啡吗
<4-20,Emily>Um, you think you'd want to grab a cup of coffee?

204
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,200
<4-20,Emily>还在听吗
<4-20,Emily>Hello?

205
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,710
<4-21,Raj>不好意思  我貌似得用超烦人超久的时间
<4-21,Raj>I'm sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time

206
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,530
<4-21,Raj>来决定我对此事作何感想
<4-21,Raj>deciding how I feel about this!

207
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,750
<4-22,Emily>我只是...怀念跟你在一起的时光
<4-22,Emily>I just... I miss hanging out with you.

208
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,570
<4-22,Emily>感觉我失去的不是一位朋友
<4-22,Emily>It's not like I lost a friend,

209
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,060
<4-22,Emily>我失去的是我的挚友
<4-22,Emily>it's like I lost my best friend.

210
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,720
<4-22,Emily>有没有可能你来我家一趟
<4-22,Emily>Is there any chance you'd want to come over?

211
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,420
<4-23,Raj>抱歉  我觉得这不是一个好主意
<4-23,Raj>I'm sorry, I don't think that's a good idea.

212
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,190
<4-23,Raj>好吧  我只是...
<4-23,Raj>Okay. I'm just...

213
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,790
<4-24,Emily>我现在真的很难过
<4-24,Emily>I'm having a really hard time,

214
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,710
<4-24,Emily>但那不关你事  是我自己的问题
<4-24,Emily>but that's not your problem, that's mine.

215
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,430
<4-24,Emily>我不会再来烦你了
<4-24,Emily>I-I won't bother you again,

216
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,340
<4-24,Emily>但请记住  我心里永远有一个位置属于你
<4-24,Emily>but please know that you'll always have a place in my heart.

217
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,650
<4-24,Emily>再见  拉杰
<4-24,Emily>Bye, Raj.

218
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,540
<4-24,Emily>你是一个好男人
<4-24,Emily>You're a good guy.

219
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,300
<4-25,Raj>再见  艾米丽
<4-25,Raj>Good-bye, Emily.

220
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,310
<4-25,Raj>真是太艰难了  姑娘们
<4-25,Raj>That was rough, you guys.

221
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,690
<4-26,Penny>我知道  但你做到了  我为你感到骄傲
<4-26,Penny>I know, but you did it. I'm so proud of you.

222
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,920
<4-27,Raj>那我先走了  不打扰你们闺蜜之夜
<4-27,Raj>Well, anyway, I'll leave you to your girls' night.

223
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,970
<4-28,Amy>你确定不留下来跟我们待在一起吗
<4-28,Amy>Are you sure you don't want to stay here with us?

224
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,220
<4-29,Raj>不了  我现在想自己安静会儿
<4-29,Raj>No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.

225
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,200
<4-30,Bernadette>如果你改变主意  我们会陪着你
<4-30,Bernadette>Well, if you change your mind, we'll be here.

226
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,910
<4-31,Raj>谢谢
<4-31,Raj>Thank you.

227
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,450
<4-32,Penny>帮我们向艾米丽问好
<4-32,Penny>Say hi to Emily for us.

228
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,580
<4-33,Raj>没问题
<4-33,Raj>Will do.

229
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,270
<5-1,Howard>这份合同我看行
<5-1,Howard>This contract looks good to me.

230
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,990
<5-2,Sheldon>当然看起来行啦
<5-2,Sheldon>I'll say it looks good.

231
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,720
<5-2,Sheldon>用的可是我的专属字体  谢尔维提卡体
<5-2,Sheldon>It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.

232
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,690
<5-3,Leonard>我想说一些讨厌的话
<5-3,Leonard>I want to say something obnoxious,

233
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,980
<5-3,Leonard>但读起来的确挺舒服
<5-3,Leonard>but it is easy on the eyes.

234
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,320
<5-4,Bernadette>我有点累了  华仔  可以走了吗
<5-4,Bernadette>I'm a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?

235
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,830
<5-5,Howard>等一下  我得先把合同签了
<5-5,Howard>Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.

236
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,940
<5-6,Bernadette>什么合同
<5-6,Bernadette>What is it?

237
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,820
<5-7,Howard>我的专利股份遇到了问题
<5-7,Howard>Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent,

238
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,480
<5-7,Howard>所以我们要建立合伙关系
<5-7,Howard>so we're forming a partnership

239
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
<5-7,Howard>平分我们获得的任何利益
<5-7,Howard>to split anything we make equally.

240
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,250
<5-8,Penny>谢尔顿  合同是你起草的吗
<5-8,Penny>Sheldon, did you draft the contract?

241
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,200
<5-9,Sheldon>当然是我啊
<5-9,Sheldon>You bet I did.

242
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,270
<5-10,Penny>你今晚一定能狠狠"爱"一发
<5-10,Penny>You're gonna make out so hard tonight.

243
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,630
<5-11,Bernadette>所以  你们打算不请律师过目一下
<5-11,Bernadette>So, you're just gonna sign this

244
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,350
<5-11,Bernadette>就直接签署文件了吗
<5-11,Bernadette>without having a lawyer look at it?

245
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,060
<5-12,Sheldon>不好意思
<5-12,Sheldon>Excuse me.

246
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,550
<5-12,Sheldon>在下从幼儿园起就开始起草合同了
<5-12,Sheldon>I've been drafting contracts since kindergarten.

247
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,360
<5-12,Sheldon>当年我拿手指乱涂乱画时不需要律师
<5-12,Sheldon>Didn't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting.

248
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,400
<5-12,Sheldon>现在也就更不需要了
<5-12,Sheldon>Don't need one now.

249
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,950
<5-13,Bernadette>我知道  可是...
<5-13,Bernadette>I know, but...

250
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,580
<5-14,Howard>妮妮  他们俩是好心想办法
<5-14,Howard>Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way

251
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,310
<5-14,Howard>让我也能分一杯羹
<5-14,Howard>to keep me from being cut out.

252
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,530
<5-15,Bernadette>我也这么希望
<5-15,Bernadette>Well, I should hope so.

253
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,380
<5-15,Bernadette>毕竟这一切都是你的点子
<5-15,Bernadette>The whole thing was your idea.

254
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,200
<5-16,Amy>公平来说  霍华德的点子是基于谢尔顿的计算
<5-16,Amy>Well, to be fair, Howard's idea was based on Sheldon's math.

255
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,230
<5-17,Leonard>各位  每个人对此都有贡献  好吗
<5-17,Leonard>Guys, everyone is involved in this, okay?

256
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,310
<5-17,Leonard>霍华德的发明
<5-17,Leonard>Howard's invention,

257
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,300
<5-17,Leonard>谢尔顿的计算  我原创的
<5-17,Leonard>Sheldon's math, my original theory

258
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,360
<5-17,Leonard>将时空视为某种过冷液体的理论
<5-17,Leonard>that space-time was like a supercooled liquid.

259
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,300
<5-17,Leonard>我相信佩妮如果此刻不是忙着啃倒刺
<5-17,Leonard>Which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned

260
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,580
<5-17,Leonard>她一定会指出这一点的
<5-17,Leonard>if she wasn't working on that hangnail right now.

261
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,830
<5-18,Penny>啥
<5-18,Penny>What?

262
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,760
<5-19,Howard>亲爱的  没关系
<5-19,Howard>Honey, this is fine.

263
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,150
<5-20,Bernadette>如果你真的想签署由谢尔顿发起的合同
<5-20,Bernadette>If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up,

264
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,170
<5-20,Bernadette>那你就签吧
<5-20,Bernadette>go ahead.

265
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,160
<5-21,Howard>我能和你在外面谈一下吗
<5-21,Howard>Can I talk to you in the hall?

266
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,980
<5-23,Howard>-好的  -不好意思
<5-23,Howard>- Sure. - Excuse us.

267
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,150
<5-24,Sheldon>我说  莱纳德
<5-24,Sheldon>Hey, Leonard.

268
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,420
<5-25,Leonard>怎么了
<5-25,Leonard>What?

269
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,130
<5-26,Sheldon>如果她不认为我们应该申请这个专利
<5-26,Sheldon>If she doesn't think that we should apply for this patent,

270
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,900
<5-26,Sheldon>那她脑子绝对被"专"拍过
<5-26,Sheldon>she's being patently absurd.

271
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,210
<5-27,Leonard>冷笑话不错
<5-27,Leonard>Good one.

272
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,690
<5-28,Sheldon>太好了  你听懂了
<5-28,Sheldon>Okay, you got it.

273
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,760
<5-28,Sheldon>我还怕这个笑话太烧脑了呢
<5-28,Sheldon>See, I was afraid it was a thinker.

274
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,370
<5-29,Howard>你这是干什么
<5-29,Howard>What are you doing?

275
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,600
<5-30,Bernadette>我只是想确定你考虑清楚了
<5-30,Bernadette>I just want to make sure you've thought this through.

276
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,430
<5-31,Howard>还有什么需要考虑的  我们有了一个发明
<5-31,Howard>What's to think about? We have an invention

277
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,100
<5-31,Howard>现在想要推动它
<5-31,Howard>and want to move forward.

278
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,140
<5-32,Bernadette>华仔  你这是要和谢尔顿·库珀
<5-32,Bernadette>Howie, you're about to form a legal partnership

279
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,450
<5-32,Bernadette>建立法律上的合伙关系呀
<5-32,Bernadette>with Sheldon Cooper.

280
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,850
<5-33,Howard>如果你是想要冷静地提出无懈可击的观点
<5-33,Howard>All right, if you're gonna calmly make excellent points,

281
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,440
<5-33,Howard>那我就不想和你继续谈了
<5-33,Howard>then I don't know if I want to talk to you.

282
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,580
<5-33,Howard>好啦  我明白你的意思
<5-33,Howard>Okay. I get it.

283
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,650
<5-33,Howard>虽然你如此担心我  十分贴心
<5-33,Howard>And it's sweet that you're worried about me,

284
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,780
<5-33,Howard>但我可以照顾我自己
<5-33,Howard>but I can take care of myself.

285
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,750
<5-34,Bernadette>我不是担心你  我是担心我自己
<5-34,Bernadette>I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about me.

286
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,870
<5-34,Bernadette>我不想在整个孕期
<5-34,Bernadette>I don't want to go through this pregnancy listening

287
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,170
<5-34,Bernadette>都沉浸在你更加倍喋喋不休地抱怨
<5-34,Bernadette>to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy

288
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,000
<5-34,Bernadette>谢耳朵是如何逼疯你的
<5-34,Bernadette>more than you already do.

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,880
<5-35,Howard>看吧看吧  你又搬出滴水不漏的逻辑来了
<5-35,Howard>Here we go with the ironclad logic again.

290
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,930
<5-36,Bernadette>你之前曾试着和他一起工作过
<5-36,Bernadette>You've tried to work with him before.

291
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,330
<5-36,Bernadette>结果可是一塌糊涂
<5-36,Bernadette>It hasn't gone well.

292
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,430
<5-36,Bernadette>凭什么这一次就会不一样呢
<5-36,Bernadette>Why is this time gonna be any different?

293
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,750
<5-37,Howard>难道是我儿的智商在帮助你吗
<5-37,Howard>Is the fetus helping you?

294
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,360
<5-37,Howard>如果是的话  这可算是作弊啊
<5-37,Howard>'Cause that's cheating.

295
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,690
<6-1,Raj (answering phone)>你好
<6-1,Raj (answering phone)>Hello?

296
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,680
<6-2,Claire>你好啊  拉杰
<6-2,Claire>Hey, Raj.

297
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
<6-2,Claire>我是克莱尔  你最近如何
<6-2,Claire>It's Claire. How are you?

298
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,780
<6-3,Raj>我很好  真的很好
<6-3,Raj>Hi. I'm good. Really good.

299
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,230
<6-3,Raj>我不知道自己为什么要说真的很好
<6-3,Raj>Well, I don't know why I said "Really good."

300
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,360
<6-3,Raj>我也就是一般的好吧
<6-3,Raj>I'm just regular good.

301
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,220
<6-3,Raj>我真的只是想听起来更有自信一些
<6-3,Raj>I really just wanted to sound confident.

302
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,780
<6-3,Raj>这个"真的"是真的"真的"
<6-3,Raj>And that "really" was a real "really,"

303
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,120
<6-3,Raj>不像第一个"真的"只是假装"真的"
<6-3,Raj>not a fake "really" like the first "really."

304
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,250
<6-4,Claire>真的吗
<6-4,Claire>Really?

305
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,230
<6-5,Raj>我不知道  我已经晕了  还错过了公路口
<6-5,Raj>I don't know. I lost track and I missed my exit.

306
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,610
<6-5,Raj>所以...你还好吗
<6-5,Raj>So, uh... so what's up?

307
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,070
<6-6,Claire>上一次我们打电话时
<6-6,Claire>Well, last time we talked,

308
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,790
<6-6,Claire>我刚刚和我男友复合了
<6-6,Claire>I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend,

309
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,020
<6-6,Claire>我想让你知道  我俩又吹了
<6-6,Claire>and I wanted to let you know that things didn't work out.

310
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,580
<6-7,Raj>真的吗  我很抱歉
<6-7,Raj>Really? I'm sorry.

311
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,300
<6-7,Raj>我发誓  我的词汇量远远不止这个
<6-7,Raj>I swear I know other words.

312
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,950
<6-8,Claire>所以如果你还有兴趣的话...
<6-8,Claire>So if you were still interested...

313
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,050
<6-9,Raj>有  绝对有  肯定有  毫无疑有
<6-9,Raj>Yes! Indeed! Absolutely! Indubitably!

314
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,510
<6-9,Raj>我不确定最后一个词的意思
<6-9,Raj>I'm not even sure what the last one means,

315
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,280
<6-9,Raj>但这至少是其他我会的词汇
<6-9,Raj>but it's another word, and I know it.

316
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,480
<6-9,Raj>那你什么时候想见见面呢
<6-9,Raj>So, uh, when do you want to meet up?

317
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,200
<6-10,Claire>我马上就要下班了
<6-10,Claire>Uh, I'm almost off work.

318
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,830
<6-10,Claire>你现在在干什么
<6-10,Claire>What are you doing now?

319
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,170
<6-10,Claire>现在吗
<6-10,Claire>R-Right now, well...

320
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,090
<6-11,Raj>其实  老实说
<6-11,Raj>Well, actually, to-to be completely honest,

321
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,720
<6-11,Raj>我准备去看望我的前女友
<6-11,Raj>I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend

322
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,280
<6-11,Raj>因为她现在很难过  可是
<6-11,Raj>because she's having a tough time. But...

323
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,370
<6-11,Raj>这并不代表我俩会复合什么的
<6-11,Raj>it's not like we're getting back together or anything.

324
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,200
<6-12,Claire>让我猜猜  分手最难熬的地方
<6-12,Claire>Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up

325
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,210
<6-12,Claire>是她失去了挚友  从此无人可倾诉
<6-12,Claire>is that she doesn't have her best friend to talk to anymore?

326
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,580
<6-13,Raj>她的原话就是这个
<6-13,Raj>That's exactly what she said!

327
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,030
<6-13,Raj>你怎么知道的
<6-13,Raj>How do you know that?

328
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,060
<6-14,Claire>我也是女人
<6-14,Claire>I'm a girl.

329
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,700
<6-14,Claire>这条算是撩汉手册的第一页内容了吧
<6-14,Claire>It's, like, page one out of the playbook.

330
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,420
<6-15,Raj>你能把这撩汉手册的电子版发给我吗
<6-15,Raj>Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?

331
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,720
<7-1,Leonard>他们出去好一阵了
<7-1,Leonard>They've been out there a while.

332
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,180
<7-2,Amy>希望一切都正常
<7-2,Amy>I hope everything's okay.

333
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,890
<7-3,Sheldon>我在想他们到底在谈什么
<7-3,Sheldon>I wonder what they're talking about.

334
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,830
<7-4,Penny>如果你们闭嘴的话  我还可以告诉你们
<7-4,Penny>If you guys would shut up, I could tell you.

335
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,620
<7-4,Penny>装成啥都没发生的样子
<7-4,Penny>Be cool, be cool, be cool.

336
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,600
<7-7,Leonard>你们没事吧
<7-7,Leonard>Hey. You guys all right?

337
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,880
<7-8,Howard>没事  不过  我们谈了一下
<7-8,Howard>Yeah. But, um, we were talking,

338
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,320
<7-8,Howard>我开始有点担心
<7-8,Howard>and... I'm a little concerned

339
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,350
<7-8,Howard>咱们仨建立合作关系的事了
<7-8,Howard>about the three of us forming a partnership.

340
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,110
<7-9,Sheldon>你是建议我们成立有限责任公司吗
<7-9,Sheldon>Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation?

341
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,860
<7-9,Sheldon>因为我可没"有""任"识到这一点呢
<7-9,Sheldon>'Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.

342
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,030
<7-10,Howard>谢尔顿  我担心的不是钱或者其他事
<7-10,Howard>Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything.

343
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,950
<7-10,Howard>而是...你对我的态度
<7-10,Howard>It's-it's with how you treat me.

344
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,650
<7-11,Sheldon>我对你挺大方的
<7-11,Sheldon>Well, I believe I'm treating you generously.

345
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,690
<7-11,Sheldon>所以我才在合同里规定
<7-11,Sheldon>That's why I've stipulated in the contract

346
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,560
<7-11,Sheldon>你对我们的发明所作的贡献
<7-11,Sheldon>that your contributions to our invention

347
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,570
<7-11,Sheldon>与我同样重要
<7-11,Sheldon>are as valuable as my own.

348
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,170
<7-12,Bernadette>你是在说他的贡献不如你的重要吗
<7-12,Bernadette>Are you saying that his contributions aren't as valuable as yours?

349
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,490
<7-13,Sheldon>没有  我没有说
<7-13,Sheldon>No, I am not saying that,

350
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,450
<7-13,Sheldon>因为我说了一早上
<7-13,Sheldon>because I kept saying that this morning

351
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,510
<7-13,Sheldon>然后莱纳德告诉我"别再说了"
<7-13,Sheldon>and Leonard said, "Stop saying that."

352
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,470
<7-14,Howard>你看  我们每次合作都会变成这样
<7-14,Howard>See? This is what happens every time we work together.

353
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,590
<7-15,Penny>等一下
<7-15,Penny>You know what, hang on.

354
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,750
<7-15,Penny>如果让谢尔顿别无选择
<7-15,Penny>What if Sheldon had no choice

355
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,280
<7-15,Penny>只能放尊重呢
<7-15,Penny>but to be respectful?

356
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,500
<7-16,Leonard>他脖子后面有什么开关
<7-16,Leonard>Is there a switch on the back of his neck

357
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,270
<7-16,Leonard>是我们还没发现的吗
<7-16,Leonard>we don't know about?
