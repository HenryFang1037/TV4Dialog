1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,730
<1-1,Sheldon>佩妮  好啊
<1-1,Sheldon>Penny, hello.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,790
<1-2,Penny>谢尔顿
<1-2,Penny>Hey, sheldon.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,550
<1-3,Sheldon>你咋样啊
<1-3,Sheldon>What is shaking?

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,580
<1-4,Penny>什么
<1-4,Penny>I'm sorry?

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,460
<1-5,Sheldon>这是口头语嘛  开场白
<1-5,Sheldon>It's colloquial, a conversation opener.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,940
<1-5,Sheldon>你觉得今天天气好吗
<1-5,Sheldon>So, do you find the weather satisfying?

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,760
<1-5,Sheldon>我们本地的球队赢球了
<1-5,Sheldon>Are you currently sharing in the triumph

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,580
<1-5,Sheldon>你是否为之一振
<1-5,Sheldon>of some local sports team?

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,210
<1-6,Penny>你搞什么名堂  吓到我了
<1-6,Penny>What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,570
<1-7,Sheldon>我在跟你闲聊啊
<1-7,Sheldon>I'm striking up a casual conversation with you.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,130
<1-7,Sheldon>咋样
<1-7,Sheldon>S'up?

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,880
<1-8,Penny>我求你别再说了
<1-8,Penny>Please don't do that.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:35,960
<1-8,Penny>好吧
<1-8,Penny>All right,

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,280
<1-9,Sheldon>不过我觉得如果你要和某人
<1-9,Sheldon>But I'm given to understand that

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,600
<1-9,Sheldon>谈一个很尴尬的问题之前
<1-9,Sheldon>when you have something awkward to discuss with someone,

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,990
<1-9,Sheldon>最好跟他说几句不搭界的闲话
<1-9,Sheldon>it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,090
<1-10,Penny>就是说刚才那还不算尴尬事了?
<1-10,Penny>So, this wasn't the awkward part?

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,550
<1-11,Sheldon>不算
<1-11,Sheldon>No.

19
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,270
<1-12,Penny>那好吧
<1-12,Penny>Oh, all right.

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,820
<1-12,Penny>咋了
<1-12,Penny>S'up?

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,610
<1-13,Sheldon>太好了  我说对了
<1-13,Sheldon>Oh, good, I used that right.

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,510
<1-13,Sheldon>说正事吧 你应该已经注意到了  莱纳德最近
<1-13,Sheldon>Anyway, you're aware that leonard has entered into a new

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,870
<1-13,Sheldon>和一个女人发生了一段带有性关系的感情
<1-13,Sheldon>Romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,390
<1-14,Penny>现在我能感到尴尬了
<1-14,Penny>Okay, feeling the awkward now.

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,500
<1-15,Sheldon>她的名字是 斯蒂芬妮·巴内特医生
<1-15,Sheldon>Her name is dr.Stephanie barnett and she is a highly

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,210
<1-15,Sheldon>她是弗里蒙特纪念医院一名杰出的外科医生
<1-15,Sheldon>Distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial.

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,630
<1-16,Penny>-莱纳德告诉过我了  -很好
<1-16,Penny>Yeah, leonard told me. good.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,420
<1-17,Sheldon>但他可能没告诉你
<1-17,Sheldon>What he may have left out is

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,520
<1-17,Sheldon>这段感情对我来说非常重要
<1-17,Sheldon>how important this relationship is to me.

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,770
<1-18,Penny>对你
<1-18,Penny>To you?

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,420
<1-19,Sheldon>是的  在那些为数不多的和莱纳德约会过的女人中
<1-19,Sheldon>Yes, see, of the handful of women leonard's been involved with,

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,130
<1-19,Sheldon>只有她还算像个人
<1-19,Sheldon>She's the only one I have ever found tolerable.

33
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,270
<1-20,Penny>那我呢
<1-20,Penny>Well, what about me?

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,150
<1-21,Sheldon>这应该是不言自明的
<1-21,Sheldon>The statement stands for itself.

35
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,920
<1-22,Penny>你嘴好甜
<1-22,Penny>Well, aren't you sweet?

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,440
<1-23,Sheldon>而且你应该多和她接触一下
<1-23,Sheldon>Anyway, should you have any interaction with her,

37
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,230
<1-23,Sheldon>好让她别感觉到你是她的性竞争对手
<1-23,Sheldon>It would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.

38
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,310
<1-24,Penny>我看她没什么好担心的
<1-24,Penny>Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,970
<1-25,Sheldon>你现在是这么说  但看看这样的情况
<1-25,Sheldon>You say that now, but consider the following senario

40
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,130
<1-25,Sheldon>漆黑的晚上
<1-25,Sheldon>you're sitting in your apartment,

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,810
<1-25,Sheldon>你孤身一人坐在家里
<1-25,Sheldon>It's late, you're alone.

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,460
<1-25,Sheldon>你的下丘脑里正游走着雌激素
<1-25,Sheldon>Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and

43
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,480
<1-25,Sheldon>和孕激素  这时突然在你眼里
<1-25,Sheldon>Progesterone and suddenly even

44
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,890
<1-25,Sheldon>就算莱纳德也会是一名有生育能力的性对象
<1-25,Sheldon>Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate.

45
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,330
<1-25,Sheldon>或者说  配对
<1-25,Sheldon>Or a, uh, "hookup"

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,650
<1-25,Sheldon>现在的都市青年好像都这么说的
<1-25,Sheldon>As it's referred to by today's urban youth.

47
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,540
<1-26,Penny>-真的吗  -是的
<1-26,Penny>Really? yes.

48
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,730
<1-27,Sheldon>如果万一发生这种情况
<1-27,Sheldon>Now, should that happen,

49
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,110
<1-27,Sheldon>我要求你找到一种压制自己性冲动的办法
<1-27,Sheldon>I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,400
<1-28,Penny>只需要想你就可以了
<1-28,Penny>I could think about you.

51
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,290
<1-29,Sheldon>好  只要管用就行
<1-29,Sheldon>Fine, whatever works.

52
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,030
<1-30,Penny>和你交谈总是很愉快  谢尔顿
<1-30,Penny>Always nice talking to you, sheldon.

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,990
<1-31,Sheldon>再见[谢尔顿在刻意模仿黑人俚语]
<1-31,Sheldon>Uh, peace out!

54
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,050
<2-1,Sheldon>今晚多么美好啊
<2-1,Sheldon>Well, this is very pleasant.

55
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,470
<2-2,Leonard>很高兴你喜欢
<2-2,Leonard>Glad you're enjoying yourself.

56
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,530
<2-3,Sheldon>你还说通心粉三个人吃不够呢
<2-3,Sheldon>And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.

57
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,970
<2-4,Leonard>我错了
<2-4,Leonard>I stand corrected.

58
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,810
<2-5,Sheldon>你们知道么  意大利的家庭主妇都有这样一种经验
<2-5,Sheldon>You know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb.

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,810
<2-5,Sheldon>只要抓一把直径为一英寸的通心粉放在锅里烧
<2-5,Sheldon>A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is

60
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,900
<2-5,Sheldon>就足够所有人吃的了  因为它在加热之后会膨胀一倍
<2-5,Sheldon>Sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,170
<2-6,Steph>非常有趣
<2-6,Steph>That's very interesting.

62
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,840
<2-7,Sheldon>谢谢
<2-7,Sheldon>Thank you.

63
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,070
<2-8,Leonard>她不是真觉得有趣  只是礼节罢了
<2-8,Leonard>She doesn't mean it. she's just being nice.

64
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,000
<2-9,Sheldon>斯蒂芬妮
<2-9,Sheldon>Well, stephanie,

65
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,350
<2-9,Sheldon>既然莱纳德现在不想谈话
<2-9,Sheldon>Since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball,

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,920
<2-9,Sheldon>那么就由我来顶替他
<2-9,Sheldon>I guess I'll just have to pick it up.

67
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,900
<2-9,Sheldon>你有没有现场目击过凶杀
<2-9,Sheldon>Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

68
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,310
<2-11,Sheldon>-没  -好的
<2-11,Sheldon>No. good.

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,020
<2-11,Sheldon>你最喜欢什么水果
<2-11,Sheldon>What's your favorite fruit?

70
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,790
<2-12,Steph>草莓
<2-12,Steph>Uh, strawberries.

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,230
<2-13,Sheldon>严格来说不算水果  不过也不追究了
<2-13,Sheldon>Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right.

72
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,290
<2-13,Sheldon>你的医学实习是在哪儿做的
<2-13,Sheldon>Where did you do your medical internship?

73
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,610
<2-14,Steph>劳伦斯纪念医院  在德州的加尔维斯敦
<2-14,Steph>Uh, lawrence memorial in galveston, texas.

74
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,130
<2-15,Sheldon>真的吗  我就是在那儿出生的
<2-15,Sheldon>Really? that's where I was born!

75
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,590
<2-16,Steph>不是吧
<2-16,Steph>You're kidding!

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,160
<2-17,Sheldon>在那所医院里  我度过了不少童年时光
<2-17,Sheldon>I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital.

77
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,630
<2-17,Sheldon>我十二岁的时候还坐直升机去哪儿呢
<2-17,Sheldon>When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.

78
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,760
<2-18,Steph>怎么了啊
<2-18,Steph>Why, w-w-what happened?

79
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,280
<2-19,Sheldon>辐射烧伤
<2-19,Sheldon>Radiation burns.

80
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,910
<2-19,Sheldon>我在造X射线轴向分层造影扫描机的时候发生了一点小意外
<2-19,Sheldon>A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.

81
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,430
<2-20,Steph>你居然尝试自己造一个X射线轴向分层造影扫描机?
<2-20,Steph>I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?

82
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,410
<2-21,Sheldon>我不是尝试  我是成功了
<2-21,Sheldon>No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,360
<2-21,Sheldon>而且我还用它观察了
<2-21,Sheldon>In fact, I was briefly able to see

84
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,800
<2-21,Sheldon>我姐姐的小豚鼠  雪球的内脏
<2-21,Sheldon>the inside of my sister's guinea pig,

85
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,490
<2-21,Sheldon>然后他就烧起来了
<2-21,Sheldon>Snowball, before he caught fire.

86
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,470
<2-21,Sheldon>所以我们家很流行一句话
<2-21,Sheldon>It led to an interesting

87
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,930
<2-21,Sheldon>豚鼠躲不过扫描机
<2-21,Sheldon>"not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner."

88
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,680
<2-22,Leonard>谢尔顿
<2-22,Leonard>Uh, sheldon?

89
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
<2-22,Leonard>我离开一下
<2-22,Leonard>Excuse me.

90
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,460
<2-23,Sheldon>我回来之后  为了好玩
<2-23,Sheldon>When I come back,just for fun,

91
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,200
<2-23,Sheldon>我们来聊聊架空历史
<2-23,Sheldon>the subject will be alternative history.

92
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,800
<2-23,Sheldon>主题是
<2-23,Sheldon>Specifically,

93
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,130
<2-23,Sheldon>如果林肯是来自于未来的机器人
<2-23,Sheldon>How would the civil war have gone differently

94
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,030
<2-23,Sheldon>那么南北战争的局势将会如何不同
<2-23,Sheldon>If lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,220
<2-23,Sheldon>看啊  通心粉我们都吃不掉呢
<2-23,Sheldon>Look at that, there's even pasta left over.

96
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,380
<2-24,Leonard>你到底知不知道这是一次约会
<2-24,Leonard>Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?

97
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,620
<2-25,Sheldon>明白啊
<2-25,Sheldon>I do.

98
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,830
<2-25,Sheldon>你明白么  老实说
<2-25,Sheldon>Do you? because frankly,

99
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,350
<2-25,Sheldon>自打我坐下后你就呆若木鸡
<2-25,Sheldon>you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.

100
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,840
<2-26,Leonard>好吧  那我的问题是  你为什么要坐下
<2-26,Leonard>Okay, here's my question. why did you sit down?

101
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,800
<2-27,Sheldon>帮你呀
<2-27,Sheldon>To help.

102
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,920
<2-27,Sheldon>如果你这次又失手了
<2-27,Sheldon>Look, if you fail at this relationship,

103
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,050
<2-27,Sheldon>历史证明你会的
<2-27,Sheldon>and history suggests you will,

104
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,520
<2-27,Sheldon>那么我们的先头登陆部队所需的
<2-27,Sheldon>Then we risk losing the medical officer

105
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,490
<2-27,Sheldon>军医很可能就没了
<2-27,Sheldon>That our landing party has always needed.

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,820
<2-28,Leonard>什么先头登陆部队
<2-28,Leonard>What landing party?

107
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,890
<2-29,Sheldon>你是寇克  我是史波克  沃罗威茨是史考特
<2-29,Sheldon>You're kirk, I'm spock, wolowitz is scotty,

108
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,730
<2-29,Sheldon>库萨帕里是那个总是被杀的
<2-29,Sheldon>Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed...

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,500
<2-29,Sheldon>现在我们有了麦考伊[《星际迷航》里的人物]
<2-29,Sheldon>And now we've got mccoy.

110
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,280
<3-1,Steph>我们都站在那看着术后X光片
<3-1,Steph>We're all standing around looking at the post-op x ray

111
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,150
<3-1,Steph>然后就是那个
<3-1,Steph>and there it is,

112
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,120
<3-1,Steph>众目睽睽之下  就在那人的胸腔里
<3-1,Steph>Clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity...

113
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,020
<3-1,Steph>有我一只耳环
<3-1,Steph>One of my earrings.

114
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,710
<3-2,Leonard>天呐  那你怎么办
<3-2,Leonard>Oh, my god, what did you do?

115
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,810
<3-3,Steph>你觉得我还能怎么办
<3-3,Steph>What do you think I did?

116
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,620
<3-3,Steph>我偷偷把另一只耳环给摘了
<3-3,Steph>I discreetly slipped off the other earring,

117
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,400
<3-3,Steph>放在兜里逃离现场
<3-3,Steph>Put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!

118
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,350
<3-4,Sheldon (arriving)>捉迷藏的奖品捏

<3-9,Sheldon>那你干得真是再好不过了
<3-9,Sheldon>You couldn't have done a better job.

150
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,970
<4-5,Sheldon>这是斯蒂芬妮的facebook网页
<4-5,Sheldon>This is stephanie's facebook page.

151
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,110
<4-5,Sheldon>你看  本来应该是"交往中"的  她写的是什么
<4-5,Sheldon>Now, where it should say "in a relationship," what does it say?

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,930
<4-6,Leonard>"斯蒂芬妮  巴奈特单身"

155
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,330
<4-7,Sheldon>谁是麦克
<4-7,Sheldon>Who's mike?!

156
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,410
<4-7,Sheldon>为什么他得到一只电子羊而不是你
<4-7,Sheldon>Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?

157
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,670
<4-8,Leonard>这只不过是她的facebook网页罢了
<4-8,Leonard>It's just her facebook page and we've

158
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,650
<4-8,Leonard>而且我们只约会过几周

<4-9,Sheldon>You don't see it, do you?

160
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
<4-9,Sheldon>我们就要失去她了
<4-9,Sheldon>We're losing her.

161
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,000
<4-10,Leonard>好吧  我简而言之
<4-10,Leonard>Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you.

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,760
<4-10,Leonard>你并不在这场恋爱里面
<4-10,Leonard>You are not in this relationship.

163
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,190
<4-10,Leonard>我在
<4-10,Leonard>I am.

164
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,600
<4-10,Leonard>也就是说 你对于我和斯蒂芬妮之间
<4-10,Leonard>Ergo, you have no say in anything

165
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,330
<4-10,Leonard>发生的事没有发言权
<4-10,Leonard>that happens between me and stephanie.

166
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,720
<4-11,Sheldon>恕难从命
<4-11,Sheldon>I'm afraid I can't allow that.

167
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,240
<4-11,Sheldon>根据星际战舰总纲领104第一部分
<4-11,Sheldon>Pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a,

168
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,900
<4-11,Sheldon>你不是合适的人选  我替你指挥
<4-11,Sheldon>You are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.

169
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,420
<4-12,Leonard>总纲领104  第一部分不适用于此情况
<4-12,Leonard>General order 104, section a does not apply in this situation.

170
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,030
<4-13,Sheldon>给我个好的理由为什么不适用
<4-13,Sheldon>Give me one good reason why not.

171
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,010
<4-14,Leonard>因为这不是《星际迷航》
<4-14,Leonard>Because this is not startrek

172
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,690
<5-1,Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) >佩妮

176
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,030
<5-4,Penny>这是门把手
<5-4,Penny>This is a door knob.

177
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,300
<5-5,Sheldon>根据我的理解  主动赠送食物
<5-5,Sheldon>It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can

178
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,240
<5-5,Sheldon>可以作为被邀请进屋聊天的敲门砖
<5-5,Sheldon>Be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.

179
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,700
<5-6,Penny>谢尔顿  想进来么
<5-6,Penny>Sheldon, would you like to come in?

180
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,820
<5-7,Sheldon>那就聊一会吧
<5-7,Sheldon>I suppose I could spare a few minutes.

181
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,900
<5-7,Sheldon>你被抢劫啦
<5-7,Sheldon>Were you robbed?

182
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,350
<5-8,Penny>没
<5-8,Penny>No.

183
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,730
<5-9,Sheldon>你怎么会这么肯定
<5-9,Sheldon>How can you be sure?

184
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,900
<5-10,Penny>谢尔顿  你想干嘛
<5-10,Penny>Sheldon, what do you want?

185
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,500
<5-11,Sheldon>我知道你并不会惊讶
<5-11,Sheldon>I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you,

186
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,580
<5-11,Sheldon>不过莱纳德又要失恋了
<5-11,Sheldon>But leonard is failing in yet another relationship.

187
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,010
<5-12,Penny>他和斯蒂芬妮出问题了吗
<5-12,Penny>He's having problems with stephanie?

188

<5-13,Sheldon>她在网上赠送给随机男性虚拟牲口
<5-13,Sheldon>She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet.

189
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,120
<5-13,Sheldon>我需要数据  才能保证他们在一起
<5-13,Sheldon>If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data.

190
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,720
<5-13,Sheldon>特别是
<5-13,Sheldon>Specifically,

191
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,990
<5-13,Sheldon>我要确切地知道莱纳德做了什么
<5-13,Sheldon>I need to know exactly what leonard did that

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,980
<5-13,Sheldon>让你"性"趣昂然
<5-13,Sheldon>Caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.

193
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,810
<5-14,Penny>什么
<5-14,Penny>What?

194
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,290
<5-15,Sheldon>还是  都市俚语
<5-15,Sheldon>Again, urban slang.

195
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,350
<5-15,Sheldon>我看我用得越来越溜了
<5-15,Sheldon>In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency.

196
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,730
<5-15,Sheldon>"往下来"和"找低处"[俚语中有口交之意]如何
<5-15,Sheldon>So, what is the "down" and the "low"?

197
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,950
<5-15,Sheldon>别担心  这完全是保密的
<5-15,Sheldon>And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so,

198
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,020
<5-15,Sheldon>你可以自由谈论 其性事的缺陷
<5-15,Sheldon>You feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

199
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,700
<5-16,Penny>我们从未上过床
<5-16,Penny>We never got to the bedroom.

200
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,480
<5-17,Sheldon>原因是
<5-17,Sheldon>Because?

201
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,530
<5-18,Penny>好了  知道吗
<5-18,Penny>Oh, okay, all right, you know what?

202
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,200
<2-18,Steph>我告诉你怎么回事
<2-18,Steph>I'll tell you what happened.

203
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,100
<5-18,Penny>我们当时年少  十分相爱
<5-18,Penny>We were young, we were very much in love,

204
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,570
<5-18,Penny>但我们只能通过
<5-18,Penny>But we could only communicate through a

205
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,470
<5-18,Penny>我湖边屋的时光穿梭邮箱交流[《看不见的恋人》中情节]
<5-18,Penny>Time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.

206
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,050
<5-19,Sheldon>你让我看那电影还不够
<5-19,Sheldon>It's not enough that you made me watch that movie,

207
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,590
<5-19,Sheldon>你还用它嘲笑我
<5-19,Sheldon>But now you mock me with it?

208
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,280
<6-1,Sheldon>绅士们  我有个关于约会和恋爱的问题
<6-1,Sheldon>Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.

209
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,580
<6-2,Raj>你说你已经和他谈过那个了[暗指性]
<6-2,Raj>You told me you were going to have the talk with him.

210
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,090
<6-3,Howard>我还等着有人和我谈那个呢
<6-3,Howard>I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.

211
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,860
<6-4,Sheldon>更重要的是
<6-4,Sheldon>More to the point,

212
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,930
<6-4,Sheldon>想办法让莱纳德和斯蒂芬妮继续交往下去
<6-4,Sheldon>It's about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together.

213
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,200
<6-5,Howard>我认为你做不到
<6-5,Howard>Oh, I don't think you can.

214
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,430
<6-6,Sheldon>为什么不行
<6-6,Sheldon>Well, why not?

215
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,820
<6-7,Howard>看看莱纳德的记录
<6-7,Howard>Look at leonard's record.

216
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,710
<6-7,Howard>与乔伊斯·金交往二十七天
<6-7,Howard>27 days with joyce kim.

217
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,030
<6-8,Raj>然后她逃跑回了朝鲜

<6-9,Howard>与莱斯利·温克尔嘿咻两次
<6-9,Howard>Two booty calls with leslie winkle.

219
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,600
<6-10,Raj>因此得了个昵称"光速莱纳德"
<6-10,Raj>For which she awarded him the nickname "speed of light leonard."

220
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,940
<6-11,Howard>三次与佩妮共进晚餐
<6-11,Howard>And the three hour dinner with penny.

221
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,200
<6-12,Raj>如他们没坐下来点蛋奶酥的话
<6-12,Raj>Which would have been two and a half if

222
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,970
<6-12,Raj>就只能算是两次半
<6-12,Raj>They ordered the souffle when they sat down.

223
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,880
<6-13,Howard>根据几何级数
<6-13,Howard>Based on the geometric progression,

224

<6-13,Howard>在20分钟后就该完蛋了
<6-13,Howard>should have ended after 20 minutes.

226
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,030
<6-14,Sheldon>我懂如何计算
<6-14,Sheldon>Yes, I'm aware of the math.

227
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,400
<6-14,Sheldon>Y等于27天除以12的商
<6-14,Sheldon>Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

228
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,370
<6-14,Sheldon>问题仍未解决
<6-14,Sheldon>The issue remains.

229
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,970
<6-14,Sheldon>我们如何能避免他不可避免的失败
<6-14,Sheldon>How do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?

230
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,390
<6-15,Raj>如你想确保他在斯蒂芬妮的考虑之列
<6-15,Raj>Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie,

231
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,520
<6-15,Raj>最有把握的是宰了这星球上所有别的男性
<6-15,Raj>Your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.

232
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,740
<6-15,Raj>我告诉你什么不该做
<6-15,Raj>I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.

233
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,550
<6-16,Howard>别怂恿他用那广告上说的
<6-16,Howard>Don't shpritz him with that body spray from the

234
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,690
<6-16,Howard>女人闻到就会宽衣解带的香体喷雾
<6-16,Howard>Commercial where the women undress when they smell it.

235
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,010
<6-16,Howard>一点都没用
<6-16,Howard>That doesn't work at all.

236
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,000
<6-16,Howard>不管你洒了多少
<6-16,Howard>No matter how much you put on.

237
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,330
<6-17,Sheldon>这就是你们的本事
<6-17,Sheldon>So, that's all you've got?

238
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,300
<6-17,Sheldon>天启式的种族灭绝和"别轻信古龙水"
<6-17,Sheldon>Apocalyptic genocide and "go easy on the cologne"?

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,090
<6-18,Howard>-对啊  -是的
<6-18,Howard>Yeah. yes.

243
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,450
<7-2,Penny>佩妮

245
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,670
<7-4,Penny>谢谢
<7-4,Penny>Oh, thank you.

246
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,380
<7-5,Sheldon>我能进去吗
<7-5,Sheldon>May I come in?

247
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,100
<7-6,Penny>不行
<7-6,Penny>No.

248
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,340
<7-6,Penny>我懂了
<7-6,Penny>I see.

249
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,080
<7-6,Penny>显然
<7-6,Penny>Apparently,

250
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,730
<7-7,Sheldon>我之前关于
<7-7,Sheldon>My earlier inquiry regarding

251
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,690
<7-7,Sheldon>你和莱纳德的问题越界了
<7-7,Sheldon>you and leonard crossed some sort of line.

252
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,910
<7-7,Sheldon>我道歉
<7-7,Sheldon>I apologize.

253
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,970
<7-8,Penny>谢谢你
<7-8,Penny>Well, thank you.

254
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,060
<7-9,Sheldon>那我们又可以平等交谈了
<7-9,Sheldon>So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?

255
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,500
<7-10,Penny>-是的  -很好
<7-10,Penny>Yes. great.

256
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,500
<7-11,Sheldon>新的话题
<7-11,Sheldon>New topic.

257
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,820
<7-11,Sheldon>你现在在你月经周期里的哪一天
<7-11,Sheldon>Where are you in your menstrual cycle?

258
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,730
<7-12,Penny>什么
<7-12,Penny>What?!

259
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,760
<7-13,Sheldon>我在网上做了些调查
<7-13,Sheldon>I've been doing some research online,

260
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,790
<7-13,Sheldon>显然灵长目雌性
<7-13,Sheldon>and apparently female primates,

261
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,430
<7-13,Sheldon>猿  黑猩猩  你们
<7-13,Sheldon>You know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you.

262
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,360
<7-13,Sheldon>她们觉得她们的配偶
<7-13,Sheldon>They find their mate more desirable

263
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,270
<7-13,Sheldon>被另一个雌性追求时  更有吸引力
<7-13,Sheldon>When he's being courted by another female.

264
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,930
<7-13,Sheldon>当竞争的雌性在排卵期
<7-13,Sheldon>Now, This effect is intensified when the rival female

265
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,820
<7-13,Sheldon>分泌激素时  这种效果更强烈
<7-13,Sheldon>Is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation.

266
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,350
<7-13,Sheldon>这又回到我最初的问题
<7-13,Sheldon>Which brings me back to my question.

267
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,320
<7-13,Sheldon>你在...
<7-13,Sheldon>Where are you in your--

268
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,620
<7-13,Sheldon>很显然  我早来了14天
<7-13,Sheldon>Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

269
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,860
<8-1,Leonard>我是说要是能治疗黄热病和疟疾
<8-1,Leonard>All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria,

270
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,000
<8-1,Leonard>为何不能治乳糖不耐症
<8-1,Leonard>Why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?

271
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,390
<8-2,Steph>莱纳德  撒手别想了
<8-2,Steph>Leonard, you're going to have to let this go.

272
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,370
<8-2,Steph>你吃点乳酪就放屁
<8-2,Steph>You had a little cheese dip, you farted.

273
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,950
<8-2,Steph>我觉得很可爱
<8-2,Steph>I thought it was cute.

274
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,060
<8-3,Sheldon>斯蒂芬妮
<8-3,Sheldon>Oh, hi, stephanie.

275
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,830
<8-5,Leonard>再来点红酒
<8-5,Leonard>Wanna more wine?

276
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,720
<8-6,Steph>好的  反正我今晚又不开车去哪
<8-6,Steph>Yeah, I'm not driving anywhere tonight.

277
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,060
<8-7,Leonard>你在干什么
<8-7,Leonard>What are you doing?

278
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,180
<8-8,Sheldon>我特别想吃白芦笋
<8-8,Sheldon>I have a craving for white asparagus

279
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,260
<8-8,Sheldon>但显然未能如愿
<8-8,Sheldon>That apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.

280
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,830
<8-9,Leonard>失陪一下
<8-9,Leonard>Excuse me.

281
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,930
<8-9,Leonard>你到底怎么了
<8-9,Leonard>What the hell is wrong with you?

282
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,150
<8-10,Sheldon>我在帮你留住斯蒂芬妮
<8-10,Sheldon>I'm helping you with stephanie.

283
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,530
<8-11,Leonard>通过像便秘的驼鹿一样叫唤
<8-11,Leonard>By making constipated moose sounds?

284
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,050
<8-12,Sheldon>当我没打开这瓶盖  而你打开了
<8-12,Sheldon>When I fail to open this jar and you succeed,

285
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,180
<8-12,Sheldon>这样你就像个男子汉
<8-12,Sheldon>It will establish you as the "alpha" male.

286
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,230
<8-12,Sheldon>你知道吗
<8-12,Sheldon>You see...

287
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,260
<8-12,Sheldon>当女性看到你在展示力量时
<8-12,Sheldon>When a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination,

288
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,050
<8-12,Sheldon>她会产生荷尔蒙催产素
<8-12,Sheldon>She produces the hormone oxytocin.

289
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,100
<8-12,Sheldon>之后如果你们俩交往的话
<8-12,Sheldon>If the two of you then engage in intercourse,

290
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,670
<8-12,Sheldon>它会在大脑促生生物化学反应
<8-12,Sheldon>This will create the biochemical reaction in the brain

291
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,680
<8-12,Sheldon>让人们想当然地以为自己陷入爱河
<8-12,Sheldon>Which lay people naively interpret as "falling in love."

292
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,920
<8-13,Leonard>那我给你脸一拳管用吗
<8-13,Leonard>Would it work if I just punched you in the face?

293
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,960
<8-14,Sheldon>当然可以  但还是让我们看看这个行吗
<8-14,Sheldon>Yes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes.

294
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,890
<8-14,Sheldon>莱纳德  我不够强壮  还是你来吧
<8-14,Sheldon>I'm not strong enough, leonard, you'll have to do it.

295
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,220
<8-15,Leonard>看在上帝的份上
<8-15,Leonard>Oh, for god's sakes.

296
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,910
<8-16,Sheldon>开吧  已经松动了
<8-16,Sheldon>Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.

297
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,430
<8-17,Steph>需要帮助吗
<8-17,Steph>Do you want some help with that?

298
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,360
<8-18,Leonard>不要  不要  我能搞定
<8-18,Leonard>No, no, no, I got it.

299
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,850
<8-19,Sheldon>没错  没错  他能搞定  这不足为奇
<8-19,Sheldon>No, yeah, yeah, he's got it, and that's not surprising.

300
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,670
<8-19,Sheldon>很久以前  当我陷入爱河的时候
<8-19,Sheldon>This is something I long ago came to

301
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,020
<8-19,Sheldon>我是可以打开的
<8-19,Sheldon>Peace with in my role as the beta male.

302
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,020
<8-19,Sheldon>快开
<8-19,Sheldon>Open it.

303
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,370
<8-20,Steph>-天呢  你还好吗  -我不好
<8-20,Steph>- Oh, my god, are you okay? - no, I'm not.

304
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,320
<8-21,Leonard>流血了
<8-21,Leonard>I'm bleeding.

305
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,040
<8-22,Sheldon>像个角斗士一样
<8-22,Sheldon>Like a gladiator!

306
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,890
<8-23,Steph>你得缝几针
<8-23,Steph>Oh, honey, you're going to need stitches.

307
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
<8-24,Leonard>缝几针  用针缝吗
<8-24,Leonard>Stitches? with a needle?

308
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,250
<8-25,Steph>对  就几针
<8-25,Steph>Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.

309
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,790
<8-26,Leonard>好的  稍等一下
<8-26,Leonard>Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.

310
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,000
<8-27,Sheldon>顺便一提  我正在那解冻牛排呢
<8-27,Sheldon>Fyi, I was defrosting a steak in there.

311
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,640
<9-1,Sheldon>斯蒂芬尼缝得可真漂亮
<9-1,Sheldon>What a beautiful job stephanie did.

312
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,520
<9-1,Sheldon>我会用床垫缝纫法
<9-1,Sheldon>I might have gone with a mattress suture

313
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,840
<9-1,Sheldon>而不会用毯边锁缝纫法
<9-1,Sheldon>instead of a blanket stitch,

314
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,660
<9-1,Sheldon>但她缝成这样  你也只能认了
<9-1,Sheldon>But you can't argue with her results.

315
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,910
<9-1,Sheldon>没留伤疤真是太可惜了
<9-1,Sheldon>It's a shame it won't scar.

316
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,550
<9-1,Sheldon>战伤可是古时男子汉的荣誉徽章
<9-1,Sheldon>The war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.

317
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,730
<9-2,Leonard>你什么时候能安静一会
<9-2,Leonard>I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.

318
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,680
<9-3,Sheldon>言归正传
<9-3,Sheldon>Just for the record,

319
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,670
<9-3,Sheldon>我费心费力把你打造成男子汉
<9-3,Sheldon>My efforts to establish you as the alpha

320
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,070
<9-3,Sheldon>你这么痛哭流涕可没啥帮助
<9-3,Sheldon>Male were not aided by you bursting into tears.

321
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,440
<9-4,Leonard>我没痛哭流涕  只是眼睛湿润了一下而已
<9-4,Leonard>I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.

322
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,860
<9-5,Sheldon>湿润了一下
<9-5,Sheldon>Watery?

323
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,960
<9-6,Leonard>她用针刺我的手
<9-6,Leonard>She stuck a needle into my hand!

324
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,380
<9-7,Steph>我的小泪孩怎么样了
<9-7,Steph>Hey, how's my big cry baby?

325
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,250
<9-8,Leonard>我没哭
<9-8,Leonard>I didn't cry.

326
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,080
<9-9,Steph>好吧  我只是在逗你
<9-9,Steph>Okay, I'm just teasing you.

327
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,680
<9-9,Steph>不过  你确实哭了
<9-9,Steph>But, yeah, you did.

328
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,400
<9-9,Steph>好的  没问题了
<9-9,Steph>Okay, it's all good.

329
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,300
<9-9,Steph>我们送你回家  扶你上床怎么样
<9-9,Steph>What do you say we get you home and put you to bed?

330
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,650
<9-10,Leonard>那你还在那过夜吗
<9-10,Leonard>Oh, are you still going to spend the night?

331
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,350
<9-11,Steph>不行  我想你需要休息
<9-11,Steph>Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.

332
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,080
<9-12,Sheldon>她说得对  你呕吐的时候
<9-12,Sheldon>She's right. as long as you're vomiting,

333
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,130
<9-12,Sheldon>交媾是禁忌的
<9-12,Sheldon>coitus is contra-indicated.

339
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,130
<9-17,Sheldon>我真不明白为什么你那么不招女人待见呢
<9-17,Sheldon>I can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you.

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,640
<10-1,Leonard>能替我打开吗
