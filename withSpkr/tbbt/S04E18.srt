00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,570
<1-1,Priya>早啊
<1-1,Priya>Morning.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,080
<1-1,Priya>早
<1-1,Priya>Morning.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,650
<1-3,Priya>睡得好吗
<1-3,Priya>Sleep okay?

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,220
<1-4,Leonard>挺好的
<1-4,Leonard>Mm-hmm. Great.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,990
<1-4,Leonard>我能问你点儿事儿吗
<1-4,Leonard>Hey, can I ask you something?

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,310
<1-5,Priya>问吧
<1-5,Priya>Sure.

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,070
<1-6,Leonard>昨晚我想尝试《性爱宝典》
<1-6,Leonard>Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,530
<1-6,Leonard>里面的那招
<1-6,Leonard>of the Kama Sutra,

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,590
<1-6,Leonard>你是觉得有意思呢  还是觉得有种族歧视
<1-6,Leonard>was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,790
<1-7,Priya>就因为你和一位印度女人同床共枕
<1-7,Priya>Yeah, just because you're in bed with an Indian woman,

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,260
<1-7,Priya>你就觉得可以
<1-7,Priya>you think that gives you permission

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,150
<1-7,Priya>使用古印度性爱手册里的狂野体位了吗
<1-7,Priya>to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,770
<1-8,Leonard>喂  你要是能找到一本
<1-8,Leonard>Hey, if you can find a book called

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,630
<1-8,Leonard>《与白人男孩儿的诡异性爱》  我也没意见
<1-8,Leonard>Weird Sex With White Boys, I'd be okay with that.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,300
<1-9,Priya>别戴  你的眼睛这么美
<1-9,Priya>No, no, you have such beautiful eyes.

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,800
<1-9,Priya>你考虑过戴隐形眼镜吗
<1-9,Priya>Have you ever thought about getting contacts?

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,280
<1-10,Leonard>我七年级的时候试过
<1-10,Leonard>I tried in the seventh grade.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,680
<1-10,Leonard>总是戴不习惯
<1-10,Leonard>I could never get used to them.

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,930
<1-11,Priya>真是可惜
<1-11,Priya>Oh, that's too bad.

20
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,970
<1-12,Leonard>对啊  要是我戴上隐形眼镜  我肯定就是
<1-12,Leonard>Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been

21
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,600
<1-12,Leonard>史上最酷的被关在
<1-12,Leonard>the coolest debate club president

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,430
<1-12,Leonard>自己大提琴箱里的辩论俱乐部主席了
<1-12,Leonard>ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,670
<1-13,Priya>你要是现在戴上
<1-13,Priya>If you had them on now,

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,310
<1-13,Priya>就能看见咱们接下来要做啥了
<1-13,Priya>you could see what we're going to do next.

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,120
<1-14,Leonard>没  没关系的  我可以脑补的
<1-14,Leonard>Th-that's okay. I can infer from context.

26
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,160
<2-1,Howard>嗨  拉杰  想见识一下我最近练的小魔术吗
<2-1,Howard>Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I've been working on?

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,940
<2-2,Sheldon>霍华德  容我插句嘴
<2-2,Sheldon>Howard, if I may interject here

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,600
<2-2,Sheldon>给你一条友情建议
<2-2,Sheldon>with a piece of friendly advice.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,690
<2-1,Howard>难道你的人生
<2-1,Howard>Is working on magic tricks

30
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,940
<2-2,Sheldon>就指着这些魔术小把戏了吗
<2-2,Sheldon>really how you want to spend your time?

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,450
<2-2,Sheldon>我知道你只是个工程师  但是
<2-2,Sheldon>Granted, you're just an engineer, but...

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,690
<2-2,Sheldon>这并不意味着你不会某天做出一个小把戏
<2-2,Sheldon>that doesn't mean you might not someday build a geegaw

33
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,660
<2-2,Sheldon>或者小玩意儿能让别人在诺贝尔奖的
<2-2,Sheldon>or a thingamabob that may get you a "thank you"

34
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,240
<2-2,Sheldon>获奖演说里送你一句"感谢某人"呀
<2-2,Sheldon>in someone else's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,590
<2-3,Raj>你这魔术能把他变没了吗
<2-3,Raj>Is the trick making him disappear?

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,140
<2-3,Raj>好吧  咱们看看吧
<2-3,Raj>Sure, let's see it.

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,060
<2-4,Howard>给  洗一下牌
<2-4,Howard>Here, shuffle these.

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,900
<2-5,Raj>好
<2-5,Raj>Okay.

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,850
<2-6,Howard>正面朝下  摊在桌子上
<2-6,Howard>Now spread them out on the table face down.

40
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,560
<2-6,Howard>挑一张  看一眼
<2-6,Howard>Pick one, look at it.

41
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,500
<2-7,Raj>好的
<2-7,Raj>Okay.

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,570
<2-8,Howard>记住这张牌  再把它放回去
<2-8,Howard>Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.

43
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,130
<2-9,Sheldon>知道为啥他拿不到博士学位了吧
<2-9,Sheldon>Is it any wonder he doesn't have a doctorate?

44
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,360
<2-10,Howard>提醒我一下  你生日是哪天
<2-10,Howard>Remind me, what's your birthday?

45
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,860
<2-11,Raj>10月6号
<2-11,Raj>October sixth.

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,010
<2-12,Howard>好的  10月是第10个月份
<2-12,Howard>Okay, October is the tenth month.

47
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,470
<2-12,Howard>那么10  1加0等于1  1加6等于7
<2-12,Howard>So ten-- one plus zero is one, plus six is seven.

48
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,090
<2-12,Howard>翻开第7张牌
<2-12,Howard>Turn over the seventh card.

49
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,780
<2-13,Raj>我勒个去!
<2-13,Raj>How about that!

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,760
<2-14,Howard>是你选的那张牌吗
<2-14,Howard>Is that your card?

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,860
<2-15,Raj>对  没错  真厉害
<2-15,Raj>Yes, it is. Very cool!

52
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,070
<2-16,Sheldon>一点都不厉害
<2-16,Sheldon>It's not cool.

53
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,320
<2-16,Sheldon>只是个简单的用来
<2-16,Sheldon>It's a childish trick designed

54
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,480
<2-16,Sheldon>戏弄傻瓜的小把戏而已
<2-16,Sheldon>to confuse and intrigue simpletons.

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,240
<2-16,Sheldon>你是咋弄的
<2-16,Sheldon>How'd you do it?

56
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,270
<2-17,Howard>魔术师是不会透露他的秘密的
<2-17,Howard>A magician never reveals his secrets.

57
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,620
<2-17,Howard>但未来的诺奖得主肯定能搞明白的
<2-17,Howard>But surely a future Nobel Prize winner can figure it out.

58
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,460
<2-18,Sheldon>好啊
<2-18,Sheldon>Fine.

59
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,220
<2-18,Sheldon>让我想想
<2-18,Sheldon>Give me a second.

60
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,330
<2-19,Howard>你有没有注意到  每次他认真思考时都会散发培根的味道
<2-19,Howard>You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,320
<2-21,Leonard>-喂  -不好意思
<2-21,Leonard>- Oh, hey! - Sorry! Oop!

62
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,230
<2-22,Leonard>抱歉  抱歉
<2-22,Leonard>Sorry! Pardon me!

63
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,860
<2-22,Leonard>真不好意思
<2-22,Leonard>Oh, I'm so sorry!

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,850
<2-22,Leonard>都怪我
<2-22,Leonard>Oh, that was my fault.

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,010
<2-22,Leonard>看吧
<2-22,Leonard>Check it out.

66
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,200
<2-22,Leonard>我戴隐形了
<2-22,Leonard>I just got contacts.

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,000
<2-22,Leonard>生活大爆炸
<2-22,Leonard>第四季第十八集

68
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,480
<3-1,Penny>一  二
<3-1,Penny>One, two,

69
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,760
<3-1,Penny>三  四  五
<3-1,Penny>three, four, five.

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,870
<3-1,Penny>不可能吧
<3-1,Penny>No way.

71
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,720
<3-2,Howard>这张牌就是你挑的  对吧
<3-2,Howard>That's your card, right?

72
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
<3-3,Penny>草花7
<3-3,Penny>Seven of clubs!

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,330
<3-3,Penny>太神奇了
<3-3,Penny>That is amazing!

74
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,830
<3-4,Sheldon>一点都不神奇
<3-4,Sheldon>It's not amazing.

75
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,850
<3-4,Sheldon>魔术小把戏都离不开
<3-4,Sheldon>All magic tricks are merely a combination

76
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,080
<3-4,Sheldon>操纵和误导的窠臼
<3-4,Sheldon>of manipulation and misdirection

77
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,510
<3-4,Sheldon>有时候还会有侏儒藏在箱子里晃腿
<3-4,Sheldon>with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.

78
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,700
<3-5,Howard>哦  真的吗  那我是怎么做到的
<3-5,Howard>Oh, really? So how did I do it?

79
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,040
<3-6,Sheldon>我才不在乎你是怎么做到的
<3-6,Sheldon>I don't care how you did it.

80
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,090
<3-7,Howard>有更重要的问题等着我思考
<3-7,Howard>I have more important things to think about.

81
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,450
<3-6,Sheldon>显然这些牌上都是有记号的
<3-6,Sheldon>Clearly, the cards are marked.

82
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,410
<3-7,Howard>我以为你在思考更重要的事儿呢
<3-7,Howard>I thought you had more important things to think about.

83
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,010
<3-8,Sheldon>没错  你恰好
<3-8,Sheldon>I do. You just happened

84
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,000
<3-8,Sheldon>碰见我休息了
<3-8,Sheldon>to have caught me on a break.

85
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,920
<3-8,Sheldon>让我看看这些牌
<3-8,Sheldon>Oh, let me see those cards.

86
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,460
<3-9,Penny>有啥大不了的  不知道
<3-9,Penny>Big deal. Not knowing

87
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,560
<3-9,Penny>才有乐趣啊
<3-9,Penny>is part of the fun.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,590
<3-9,Penny>"不知道才有乐趣啊"
<3-9,Penny>"Not knowing is part of the fun."

89
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,030
<3-10,Sheldon>这是你们社区大学的校训吗
<3-10,Sheldon>Was that the motto of your community college?

90
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,780
<3-11,Leonard>各位  你们觉得咋样
<3-11,Leonard>Hey, guys, what do you think?

91
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,250
<3-11,Leonard>普丽娅带我去买衣服了
<3-11,Leonard>Priya took me clothes shopping.

92
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,740
<3-12,Penny>哇  看起来真不错
<3-12,Penny>Hey, you look great.

93
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,640
<3-12,Penny>干得好  普丽娅
<3-12,Penny>Good for you, Priya.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,150
<3-12,Penny>我怎么样都没法让他不穿那件难看的帽衫
<3-12,Penny>I could never get that stupid hoodie off him

95
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,480
<3-12,Penny>在我俩还那啥的时候
<3-12,Penny>when we were...

96
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,920
<3-12,Penny>额  你看起来好帅
<3-12,Penny>Well, you look great.

97
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,710
<3-13,Leonard>多谢
<3-13,Leonard>Thank you.

98
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,810
<3-14,Priya>咱去把衣服都挂起来吧
<3-14,Priya>Let's go hang everything up.

99
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,290
<3-15,Leonard>嗯  好
<3-15,Leonard>Yeah, good.

100
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,650
<3-15,Leonard>新隐形眼镜
<3-15,Leonard>New contacts.

101
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,830
<3-15,Leonard>我该早几年戴的
<3-15,Leonard>I should have done this years ago.

102
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,640
<3-16,Howard>这么说你终于习惯他俩每天都这样了
<3-16,Howard>So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,540
<3-17,Penny>我已经不和他在一起了
<3-17,Penny>I'm not going out with him.

104
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,180
<3-17,Penny>他想跟谁上床都无所谓
<3-17,Penny>He can sleep with whoever he wants.

105
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,620
<3-18,Howard>我在和拉杰说话呢
<3-18,Howard>Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,500
<3-19,Penny>啊哦
<3-19,Penny>Oopsy.

107
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
<3-20,Sheldon>这副牌肯定做了手脚
<3-20,Sheldon>This deck is rigged in some fashion.

108
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,510
<3-21,Howard>好吧  换一副牌
<3-21,Howard>Fine. Get another deck

109
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,470
<3-21,Howard>我照样能变给你看
<3-21,Howard>and I'll do the trick with that.

110
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,920
<3-22,Sheldon>你是说这是一副正常的牌吗
<3-22,Sheldon>So you're saying this is a regulation deck?

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,340
<3-23,Howard>我是说要相信魔法  你个麻瓜
<3-23,Howard>I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.

112
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,780
<3-24,Penny>我很高兴莱纳德找到了女友
<3-24,Penny>You know, well, I'm happy Leonard's found someone.

113
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,770
<3-24,Penny>虽然没人问起这个
<3-24,Penny>Not that anybody asked.

114
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,390
<4-1,Priya>你有多少件星际迷航的制服
<4-1,Priya>How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?

115
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,520
<4-2,Leonard>就两件
<4-2,Leonard>Just two:

116
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,100
<4-2,Leonard>常服和礼服各一
<4-2,Leonard>everyday and dress.

117
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,140
<4-3,Priya>我们得谈谈
<4-3,Priya>Listen, we need to talk about something.

118
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,180
<4-4,Leonard>天哪  你是要跟我分手
<4-4,Leonard>Oh, my God, you're breaking up with me!

119
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,510
<4-4,Leonard>为什么要带我去买衣服
<4-4,Leonard>Why would you take me out shopping

120
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,290
<4-4,Leonard>然后跟我分手  那太残忍了
<4-4,Leonard>and then break up with me? That is so cruel!

121
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,770
<4-5,Priya>莱纳德  我不是要跟你分手
<4-5,Priya>Leonard, I'm not breaking up with you.

122
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,160
<4-5,Priya>哦  好吧
<4-5,Priya>Oh, okay.

123
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,950
<4-6,Leonard>那你要谈什么
<4-6,Leonard>So, what's up?

124
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,010
<4-7,Priya>我就觉得怪怪的
<4-7,Priya>It's a little weird,

125
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,020
<4-7,Priya>你前女友一天到晚在这玩
<4-7,Priya>your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.

126
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,620
<4-7,Priya>我知道
<4-7,Priya>I know.

127
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,450
<4-8,Leonard>我通常跟前女友老死不相往来
<4-8,Leonard>I usually never see my ex-girlfriends,

128
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,550
<4-8,Leonard>除非她们的硬盘崩溃
<4-8,Leonard>unless their hard drives crash.

129
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,580
<4-9,Priya>我只是说  要是我整天
<4-9,Priya>I'm just saying, how would you feel

130
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,000
<4-9,Priya>跟前男友混在一块  你觉得怎样
<4-9,Priya>if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,450
<4-10,Leonard>不怎么好  我想
<4-10,Leonard>Um, not great, I guess.

132
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,090
<4-10,Leonard>但我和佩妮现在只是朋友
<4-10,Leonard>But Penny and I are just friends.

133
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,190
<4-10,Leonard>我不管
<4-10,Leonard>I don't care.

134
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,370
<4-11,Priya>她曾跟你上过床
<4-11,Priya>This is a woman you have slept with.

135
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,480
<4-11,Priya>要是你仍想她在眼前晃
<4-11,Priya>If you want her around,

136
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,880
<4-11,Priya>那我不得不认为你仍对她旧情难忘
<4-11,Priya>then I have to wonder if maybe you're not ready to move on.

137
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,730
<4-12,Leonard>不  不不  我忘了
<4-12,Leonard>No, no-no-no, I'm ready!

138
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,570
<4-12,Leonard>我都为了你宁愿目不能视
<4-12,Leonard>I gave up the gift of sight for you.

139
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,610
<4-12,Leonard>这还不算忘了旧情  算什么
<4-12,Leonard>If that's not moving on, what is?

140
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,550
<4-13,Priya>我想让你跟佩妮彻底断了
<4-13,Priya>You need to cut the cord with Penny.

141
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,600
<4-14,Leonard>哦  好的
<4-14,Leonard>Oh... okay.

142
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,590
<4-15,Priya>你好像不是很有信心
<4-15,Priya>You don't sound very confident.

143
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,430
<4-15,Priya>不  不  我很有信心
<4-15,Priya>No, no, I'm confident.

144
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,250
<4-16,Leonard>我很清楚什么叫"我要跟你一刀两断"
<4-16,Leonard>Its not like I'm unfamiliar with the "get lost" conversation.

145
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,210
<4-16,Leonard>虽然  这是第一次我跟人这么说
<4-16,Leonard>Although, this will be the first time I'll be the one saying it.

146
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,230
<4-16,Leonard>谢谢你
<4-16,Leonard>Thank you.

147
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,600
<4-17,Priya>-我很感激  -应该的
<4-17,Priya>- I appreciate it. - Sure.

148
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,770
<4-18,Leonard>天哪  你真香
<4-18,Leonard>Oh, God, you smell so good.

149
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,730
<4-18,Leonard>当然  也有可能是
<4-18,Leonard>Of course, that could just be

150
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,050
<4-18,Leonard>我其他感官更加灵敏了
<4-18,Leonard>my other senses getting stronger.

152
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,400
<4-18,Leonard>假设  我能弄到
<4-18,Leonard>Hypothetically, if I had access

153
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,930
<4-18,Leonard>一件乌胡拉中尉的制服  你会穿吗
<4-18,Leonard>to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?

154
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,000
<4-19,Priya>莱纳德  这是我和我家人莫大的痛苦
<4-19,Priya>Leonard, it's a source of great pain to me and my family

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
<4-19,Priya>因为我哥衣柜居然有这一套行头
<4-19,Priya>that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe.

156
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,830
<4-19,Priya>能不讨论这个吗
<4-19,Priya>Can we not discuss it?

157
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,580
<4-20,Leonard>抱歉  别介意
<4-20,Leonard>I'm sorry. Never mind.

158
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,920
<5-1,Howard>你之前拿的牌就是方块J吗
<5-1,Howard>And was your card the jack of diamonds?

159
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,590
<5-2,Penny>难以置信
<5-2,Penny>Oh, unbelievable!

160
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,220
<5-2,Penny>知道他怎么做到的了吗
<5-2,Penny>Know how he did it yet?

161
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,590
<5-4,Penny>嗷  他跟我小侄子一个表情
<5-4,Penny>Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets

162
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,660
<5-4,Penny>他想不通为何我鼻子跟他一样时就这样
<5-4,Penny>when he can't figure out how I got his nose.

163
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,720
<5-5,Howard>我还有几个治愈系的小魔术
<5-5,Howard>You know, I have some remedial magic tricks

164
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,300
<5-5,Howard>可能更适合你
<5-5,Howard>that might be more your speed.

165
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,340
<5-5,Howard>比如  快看
<5-5,Howard>Like, ooh, look!

166
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,500
<5-5,Howard>看这铅笔上的橡皮
<5-5,Howard>The pencil's rubber!

167
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,740
<5-6,Penny>我想我知道你怎么变的了
<5-6,Penny>Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.

168
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,930
<5-7,Sheldon>拜托  我都不明白  你怎么可能知道
<5-7,Sheldon>Oh, please, if I don't know, you don't know.

169
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,080
<5-7,Sheldon>这是不言自明的
<5-7,Sheldon>That's axiomatic.

170
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,250
<5-8,Penny>我说给你听
<5-8,Penny>Come here.

171
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,350
<5-9,Howard>还真给你说对了
<5-9,Howard>You're right.

172
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,670
<5-10,Penny>对一个不知道什么叫
<5-10,Penny>Not too bad for someone

173
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,980
<5-10,Penny>"不言自明"的人来说  还真不赖
<5-10,Penny>who doesn't know what "axiomatic" means.

174
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,200
<6-2,Penny>你的隐形眼镜呢
<6-2,Penny>What happened with the contacts?

175
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,460
<6-3,Leonard>一个在楼上
<6-3,Leonard>One of them's upstairs.

176
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,120
<6-3,Leonard>另一个好像已经跑脑袋里了
<6-3,Leonard>The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.

177
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,540
<6-4,Penny>这是普丽娅给你买的新衬衫吗
<6-4,Penny>Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?

178
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,830
<6-5,Leonard>对
<6-5,Leonard>Yeah.

179
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,500
<6-6,Penny>可不能这么洗
<6-6,Penny>You don't wanna wash that.

180
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,360
<6-7,Leonard>-不能吗  -不能  这是丝织品
<6-7,Leonard>- No? - No, that's silk.

181
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,040
<6-8,Penny>老实说  没有我你可怎么办哦
<6-8,Penny>Seriously, what would you do without me?

182
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,610
<6-5,Leonard>是啊
<6-5,Leonard>Yeah.

183
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,850
<6-10,Penny>我不得不说  我觉得
<6-10,Penny>You know, I gotta tell you, I think

184
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,970
<6-10,Penny>-你找上普丽娅真是太幸运了  -我也这么想
<6-10,Penny>- you got a real winner with Priya. - Yeah, me, too.

185
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,340
<6-12,Penny>她真是太可爱了
<6-12,Penny>She seems really sweet.

186
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,440
<6-12,Penny>相信我  你可不能觉得理所当然
<6-12,Penny>Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted.

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,380
<6-12,Penny>外面可有大堆大堆的婊子
<6-12,Penny>There are a lot of bitches out there.

188
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,800
<6-13,Leonard>是啊  找个婊子可就太糟了
<6-13,Leonard>Yeah, bitches are the worst.

189
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,430
<6-14,Penny>好了  回见
<6-14,Penny>All right, I'll see you later.

190
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,250
<6-15,Leonard>佩妮  我有事想跟你说
<6-15,Leonard>Uh, Penny, there's something I have to tell you.

191
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,910
<6-16,Penny>什么
<6-16,Penny>What?

192
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,010
<6-17,Leonard>好吧  怎么说呢
<6-17,Leonard>Okay, uh, how do I put this?

193
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,640
<6-17,Leonard>你了解达尔文在加拉帕戈斯群岛
<6-17,Leonard>Um... are you familiar with Darwin's observation

194
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,260
<6-17,Leonard>考察雀类时的观察法吗
<6-17,Leonard>of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?

195
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,010
<6-18,Penny>有拍电影出来吗
<6-18,Penny>Did they make a movie about it?

196
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,610
<6-19,Leonard>没有
<6-19,Leonard>No.

197
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,920
<6-20,Penny>那我不了解
<6-20,Penny>Then no.

198
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,430
<6-21,Leonard>好吧  达尔文观察到当两组雀类
<6-21,Leonard>All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups

199
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,730
<6-21,Leonard>去竞争同一种食物来源
<6-21,Leonard>of finches competed over the same food source,

200
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,090
<6-21,Leonard>最终  其中一种会进化出不同的鸟嘴
<6-21,Leonard>eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape

201
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,360
<6-21,Leonard>从而能以别的东西为食
<6-21,Leonard>so they could feed on something else.

202
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,730
<6-22,Penny>好吧
<6-22,Penny>Okay.

203
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,530
<6-22,Penny>你觉得我们可以从该行为中学到什么
<6-22,Penny>So what do you think we can learn from that behavior

204
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,560
<6-23,Leonard>可以运用于自己生活中的
<6-23,Leonard>that we can apply to our own lives?

205
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,190
<6-24,Penny>一鸟在手  胜过二鸟在林?
<6-24,Penny>Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?

206
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,700
<6-25,Leonard>当然  这话里也有鸟
<6-25,Leonard>Sure, that has birds in it.

207
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,010
<6-26,Penny>跟你说话真有趣  莱纳德  总学得到东西
<6-26,Penny>It's fun talking to you, Leonard; I always learn stuff.

208
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,880
<6-27,Leonard>抱歉  那就算你答应了
<6-27,Leonard>I'm sorry, but I'm gonna count that.

209
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,690
<7-1,Priya>你睡觉的时候一定要戴这玩意吗
<7-1,Priya>Do you really have to wear that in bed?

210
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,300
<7-2,Leonard>对呀  医生怕我睡着之后揉眼睛
<7-2,Leonard>Yeah. The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night.

211
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,000
<7-2,Leonard>不戴这个  就要戴那种超大的锥形颈圈
<7-2,Leonard>It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.

212
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,310
<7-3,Priya>你跟佩妮谈过了吗
<7-3,Priya>So did you get to talk to Penny?

213
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,570
<7-4,Leonard>谈了  真的  谈了
<7-4,Leonard>Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.

214
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,860
<7-5,Priya>结果呢
<7-5,Priya>And?

215
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,490
<7-6,Leonard>她毫无保留地欣然接受了
<7-6,Leonard>She completely understood everything I said.

216
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,310
<7-6,Leonard>妥妥儿的
<7-6,Leonard>Case closed.

217
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,500
<7-7,Priya>她生气了吗
<7-7,Priya>Was she upset?

218
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,590
<7-8,Leonard>也许吧  不过与我无关
<7-8,Leonard>Maybe, but that's not my problem.

219
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,190
<7-8,Leonard>她不是我女朋友  你才是
<7-8,Leonard>She's not my girlfriend, you are.

220
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,310
<7-9,Priya>不要对她太残忍
<7-9,Priya>I hope you weren't cruel to her.

221
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,570
<7-10,Leonard>那让繁花凋零的到底是秋天的残忍
<7-10,Leonard>Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die,

222
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,630
<7-10,Leonard>还是自然法则呢
<7-10,Leonard>or is that just nature's way?

223
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,300
<7-11,Sheldon>莱纳德  莱纳德  莱纳德
<7-11,Sheldon>Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?

224
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,080
<7-12,Leonard>干嘛
<7-12,Leonard>What?!

225
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,370
<7-13,Sheldon>我参透沃罗威茨的小魔术了
<7-13,Sheldon>I think I figured out Wolowitz's magic trick,

226
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,570
<7-13,Sheldon>我需要你来选一张牌
<7-13,Sheldon>and I need you to pick a card.

227

<7-14,Leonard>我不会给你开门的  谢尔顿
<7-14,Leonard>I am not opening that door, Sheldon!

228
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,260
<7-15,Sheldon>如你所愿
<7-15,Sheldon>As you wish.

229

<7-15,Sheldon>and prepare to be amazed.

231
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,060
<7-15,Sheldon>选好了吗
<7-15,Sheldon>Did you pick one?

232
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,580
<7-16,Leonard>好了
<7-16,Leonard>Yep.

233
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,640
<7-17,Sheldon>这是你选的牌吗
<7-17,Sheldon>Is this your card?

234
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,410
<7-18,Leonard>不是
<7-18,Leonard>Nope.

239
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,050
<7-21,Sheldon>选一张牌  谢尔顿
<7-21,Sheldon>Pick a card, Sheldon.

240
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,850
<7-21,Sheldon>瞟一眼  然后放回去
<7-21,Sheldon>Now look at it, and put it back in the deck.

241
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,340
<7-21,Sheldon>记住牌面了吗
<7-21,Sheldon>Now do you remember your card?

242
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,090
<8-1,Sheldon>搞笑呢吧  哥的记忆力不是讲笑的
<8-1,Sheldon>Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory.

243
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,830
<8-1,Sheldon>我的错
<8-1,Sheldon>My apologies.

244
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,700
<8-1,Sheldon>现在洗一下牌
<8-1,Sheldon>Now shuffle the cards.

245
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,210
<8-1,Sheldon>接着洗
<8-1,Sheldon>Shuffling.

246
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,900
<8-1,Sheldon>等我一下
<8-1,Sheldon>Wait here.

<8-3,Sheldon>我在对沃罗威茨的小魔术进行逆向分析
<8-3,Sheldon>I'm reverse engineering Wolowitz's magic trick.

250
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,020
<8-4,Leonard>红外摄像机能派上什么用场
<8-4,Leonard>What's up with the infrared cameras?

251
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,900
<8-5,Sheldon>通过对扑克牌余热等级的测量
<8-5,Sheldon>I'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards

252
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,170
<8-5,Sheldon>可以确定哪张牌被摸过了
<8-5,Sheldon>to determine which one's been touched.

253
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,150
<8-5,Sheldon>顺便提醒一下
<8-5,Sheldon>By the way,

254
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,210
<8-5,Sheldon>如果你打算要小宝宝的话
<8-5,Sheldon>if you hope to have children,

<8-5,Sheldon>我建议你把三角小内内换成四角的
<8-5,Sheldon>I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers.

256
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,060
<8-5,Sheldon>你的蛋蛋看上去温度略高
<8-5,Sheldon>Your testicles look a tad warm.

257
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,740
<8-6,Leonard>我勒个去  别告诉我你进入了
<8-6,Leonard>Holy crap, are you connected

258
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,880
<8-6,Leonard>国立橡树岭研究所的系统
<8-6,Leonard>to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?

259
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,300
<8-7,Sheldon>没错  我正在用他们的克雷超级电脑
<8-7,Sheldon>Yes. I'm using their Cray supercomputer

260
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,470
<8-7,Sheldon>分析洗牌的模式
<8-7,Sheldon>to analyze shuffling patterns.

261

<8-8,Leonard>谢尔顿  那台电脑是供国防部使用的
<8-8,Leonard>Sheldon, that computer is used for national defense.

262
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,540
<8-8,Leonard>黑进去相当于刑事犯罪
<8-8,Leonard>Hacking into it is a federal crime.

263
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,390
<8-9,Sheldon>别紧张  现在又没人跟咱们打仗
<8-9,Sheldon>Relax, we're not under attack right now.

264
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,400
<8-10,Leonard>趁军方直升机没来之前我先出去躲躲
<8-10,Leonard>Okay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.

265
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,010
<8-11,Sheldon>这张会是我的牌吗
<8-11,Sheldon>And is this my card?

266
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,310
<8-11,Sheldon>大爷的
<8-11,Sheldon>Rats!

267
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,280
<8-11,Sheldon>我怀疑霍华德用了放射性指示剂
<8-11,Sheldon>I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer.

268
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,070
<8-11,Sheldon>这么晚了我上哪弄铀-235去啊
<8-11,Sheldon>Where am I going to find uranium-235 this time of night?

<8-11,Sheldon>给力吧  Craigslist
<8-11,Sheldon>Come on, CraigsList.

271
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,700
<9-1,Leonard>带你来印度餐厅算是种族歧视吗
<9-1,Leonard>Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?

272
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,430
<9-2,Priya>没关系  我喜欢印度菜
<9-2,Priya>It's okay, I like Indian food.

273
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,650
<9-3,Leonard>或者你可以宾至如归地称它为"菜"
<9-3,Leonard>Or as you probably call it back home, "food."

274
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,180
<9-4,Priya>你为什么不戴隐形眼镜了
<9-4,Priya>Why didn't you wear your contacts?

275
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,030
<9-4,Priya>不喜欢吗

<9-5,Leonard>No, no, I do.

277
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,230
<9-5,Leonard>只是我知道今晚要吃咖喱
<9-5,Leonard>It's just I knew I was having curry tonight

278
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,760
<9-5,Leonard>一个部位的灼痛就够我应付的了
<9-5,Leonard>and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.

279
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,120
<9-5,Leonard>知道吗
<9-5,Leonard>You know...

280
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,990
<9-6,Priya>公司向我提供了一个职位  就在洛杉矶
<9-6,Priya>...my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.

281
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,300
<9-7,Leonard>那意味着你会在这里定居了吗
<9-7,Leonard>Does that mean you'd relocate here permanently?

282
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,990
<9-8,Priya>也许吧  你觉得怎样
<9-8,Priya>Maybe. What do you think?

283

<9-11,Priya>你根本没跟她谈过对吧
<9-11,Priya>You did talk to her, didn't you?

<9-13,Penny>打扮得不像男孩服装部的模特
<9-13,Penny>like a mannequin in the boys' department.

293
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,230
<9-13,Penny>他有没有告诉你
<9-13,Penny>Hey, did he

<10-1,Sheldon>我一直想告诉你来着
<10-1,Sheldon>Oh, I've been meaning to tell you,

313
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,120
<10-3,Sheldon>而且我还进行了改进

314
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,120
<10-4,Howard>我很期待啊
<10-4,Howard>I'd love to see that.

<10-4,Howard>你呢  拉杰
<10-4,Howard>How about you, Raj?

316
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,890
<10-5,Raj>边吃牛肉通心粉  边看表演
<10-5,Raj>Beefaroni and a show?

317
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,430
<10-5,Raj>怎么可能拒绝呢
<10-5,Raj>How do you turn that down?

318
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,970
<10-6,Sheldon>看好咯

<10-8,Sheldon>天灵灵地灵灵  扑克牌快显灵
<10-8,Sheldon>Bippity-boppity-boo.

322
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,850
<10-9,Howard>你拿根小黑棒  哔一下是什么意思
<10-9,Howard>What's with the wand and the beep?

323
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,860
<10-10,Sheldon>小黑棒是用来凸显我的表演能力
<10-10,Sheldon>The wand is called showmanship,

324
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,260
<10-10,Sheldon>那哔的一声则不关你事
<10-10,Sheldon>and the beep is none of your business.

325
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,340
<10-10,Sheldon>抱歉
<10-10,Sheldon>Oh! Excuse me.

326
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,660
<10-10,Sheldon>我刚收到一则
<10-10,Sheldon>I'm getting a text message

327
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,850
<10-10,Sheldon>跟这魔术没半点关系的短信
<10-10,Sheldon>completely unrelated to this magic trick.

328
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,930
<10-10,Sheldon>我的衣服干洗完了
<10-10,Sheldon>Oh, look, my dry cleaning's ready.

329
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,480
<10-10,Sheldon>你手里那张牌是黑桃5
<10-10,Sheldon>And your card was the five of spades.

330
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,440
<10-12,Sheldon>看吧
<10-12,Sheldon>Ta-da.

331
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,550
<10-11,Raj>这些牌上有条形码
<10-11,Raj>These cards have barcodes on them.

332
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,760
<10-11,Raj>那根小黑棒是读码器
<10-11,Raj>The wand is a reader.

333
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,850
<10-11,Raj>能把信息传送到你手机上
<10-11,Raj>It's transmitting to your phone.

334
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,310
<10-12,Sheldon>我刚说了  "看吧"
<10-12,Sheldon>I said, "ta-da."

335
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,150
<10-12,Sheldon>看完就得了
<10-12,Sheldon>Show's over.

336
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,830
<10-13,Howard>这也太悲剧了
<10-13,Howard>That's pathetic.

337
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,460
<10-13,Howard>哥给你演示一下  真正的魔术师是怎么做的
<10-13,Howard>Let me show you how a real magician does it.

338
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,720
<10-13,Howard>拉杰  选张牌

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,160
<10-16,Raj>大师果然是大师
<10-16,Raj>you're blowing my mind!

344
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,200
<10-17,Howard>天灵灵地灵灵  大师给你来显灵
<10-17,Howard>Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

345
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,920
<10-18,Sheldon>我受够了  我要去搞点铀
<10-18,Sheldon>That does it. I'm getting uranium.

346
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,440
<10-19,Raj>你打算告诉他吗
<10-19,Raj>You ever gonna tell him?

347
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,350
<10-20,Howard>或许吧  等哪天玩腻了再说
<10-20,Howard>Maybe. When it stops being fun.

348
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,280
<10-21,Raj>那就是永远也不说咯
<10-21,Raj>So never.

<11-1,Penny>我刚准备去上班
<11-1,Penny>Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,030
<11-2,Leonard>没事  这事不重要
<11-2,Leonard>Oh, okay, its not important.

351
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,810
<11-2,Leonard>以后再说吧
<11-2,Leonard>It can wait.

352
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,520
<11-3,Penny>没关系  边下楼边说吧
<11-3,Penny>No, it's all right. Walk me down.

353
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,810
<11-3,Penny>什么事
<11-3,Penny>So, what's up?

354
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,680
<11-4,Leonard>我遇到一个难题

<11-9,Penny>What the hell is this all about?

364
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,440
<11-10,Leonard>为什么就一定要有原因吗
<11-10,Leonard>Why does it have to be about anything?

365
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,500
<11-10,Leonard>一个人请求他的伙伴搬家
<11-10,Leonard>Can't a fella ask his buddy to relocate,

366
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,410
<11-10,Leonard>就不能毫无疑问地走吗

<11-17,Penny>没关系  我保证从今以后
<11-17,Penny>It doesn't matter. Look, I promise from now on

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,490
<11-17,Penny>我会跟你保持距离
<11-17,Penny>I will keep my distance from you.

378
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,720
<11-17,Penny>呃  先等等
<11-17,Penny>Well, now, hold on.

379
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,500
<11-18,Leonard>你说的距离是指哪种
<11-18,Leonard>What kind of distance are we talking about?

380
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,700
<11-18,Leonard>因为我们是邻居
<11-18,Leonard>Because we are neighbors.

381
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,720
<11-18,Leonard>我可是那种能听见你公寓马桶冲水声的邻居
<11-18,Leonard>I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.

382
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,700
<11-19,Penny>你还能听见我的马桶冲水声
<11-19,Penny>You can hear my toilet flush?

383
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,330
<11-20,Leonard>我不是故意去听  不过很高兴知道
<11-20,Leonard>I don't listen for it, but it's nice to know

384
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,430
<11-20,Leonard>你的排水管道一切都好
<11-20,Leonard>everything's okay with your plumbing.

385
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,570
<11-20,Leonard>还有这栋楼的排水管道
<11-20,Leonard>The building's plumbing.

386
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,280
<11-21,Penny>莱纳德  我懂的
<11-21,Penny>Leonard, I get it.

387
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,490
<11-21,Penny>你现在处于一段新的恋爱
<11-21,Penny>You're in a new relationship now.

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,610
<11-21,Penny>我为你感到高兴
<11-21,Penny>And I'm happy for you.

389
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,750
<11-21,Penny>为什么我们不能握个手  好聚好散呢
<11-21,Penny>So why don't we just shake hands and part friends?

390
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,340
<11-22,Leonard>呃  先等等
<11-22,Leonard>Well, now hold on.

391
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,610
<11-22,Leonard>这样如何
<11-22,Leonard>How about this?

392
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,090
<11-22,Leonard>我们还可以一起玩  不过是地下的
<11-22,Leonard>How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?

393
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,880
<11-23,Penny>你真的是那种人吗
<11-23,Penny>Are you really that kind of guy?

394
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,480
<11-23,Penny>不是
<11-23,Penny>No.

395
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,780
<11-24,Leonard>其实当我说出"地下"这词儿的时候  我觉得有点犯傻
<11-24,Leonard>I actually felt kinda silly just saying "on the down-low."

396
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,460
<11-25,Penny>再见  莱纳德
