1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,010
<1-1,Sheldon>天啊  我超想尿尿
<1-1,Sheldon>Boy, do I have to urinate.

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,860
<1-2,Leonard>要是有办法解决就好了
<1-2,Leonard>If only there were a solution to that.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,070
<1-3,Sheldon>真的
<1-3,Sheldon>Seriously.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,960
<1-3,Sheldon>我感觉骨盆那里好像有个鱼缸
<1-3,Sheldon>I feel like I've got a fish tank in my pelvis.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,830
<1-4,Leonard>那就去上厕所啊
<1-4,Leonard>So go to the bathroom.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,150
<1-5,Sheldon>不行
<1-5,Sheldon>I can't.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,080
<1-6,Leonard>为什么
<1-6,Leonard>Why not?

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,480
<1-7,Sheldon>因为人家正在做决定
<1-7,Sheldon>Because I'm trying to decide

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,200
<1-7,Sheldon>是买Xbox One呢  还是买PS4呢
<1-7,Sheldon>between getting an Xbox One or a PS4.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,740
<1-7,Sheldon>"P"与尿尿同音  说出来更想尿尿了
<1-7,Sheldon>Oh, "Pee." Why'd I say that?

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,000
<1-8,Leonard>原谅我要问一个白痴的问题
<1-8,Leonard>Forgive me for asking a stupid question,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,110
<1-8,Leonard>但你为什么在耍白痴啊
<1-8,Leonard>but why are you being stupid?

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,490
<1-9,Sheldon>我才不是耍白痴
<1-9,Sheldon>I'm not being stupid.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,610
<1-9,Sheldon>我采用的是荷兰研究员米莉亚·塔克的研究
<1-9,Sheldon>I'm employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk,

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,270
<1-9,Sheldon>她发现人们在憋尿的时候
<1-9,Sheldon>who found that people with full bladders

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,640
<1-9,Sheldon>能做出更好的决策
<1-9,Sheldon>make better decisions.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,350
<1-10,Leonard>我当初决定搬进来之前  真不应该去尿尿
<1-10,Leonard>Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,970
<1-12,Leonard>试镜怎么样
<1-12,Leonard>Oh, how'd the audition go?

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,800
<1-13,Penny>惊艳四座
<1-13,Penny>I killed it.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,080
<1-13,Penny>我甚至在该哭的时刻  真掉了眼泪
<1-13,Penny>I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,390
<1-14,Leonard>-太好了  -就是
<1-14,Leonard>- Oh, that's great. - I know.

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,930
<1-15,Penny>等下次我超速  被警察拦下来罚款时
<1-15,Penny>Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket,

23
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,860
<1-16,Sheldon>我的"水龙头"就会哗哗流
<1-16,Sheldon>here come the waterworks.

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,690
<1-16,Sheldon>我的"水龙头"也要哗哗流了
<1-16,Sheldon>Here come the waterworks!

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,070
<1-17,Leonard>你不问为什么吗
<1-17,Leonard>Aren't you gonna ask?

26
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,470
<1-18,Penny>我第一天搬来这吗
<1-18,Penny>What is this, my first day?

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,360
<2-1,Bernadette>今天公司有件事  我能问下你们的意见吗
<2-1,Bernadette>Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,660
<2-2,Penny>-当然可以  -没问题
<2-2,Penny>- Of course. - Yeah, sure.

40
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,070
<2-4,Bernadette>我做了一件事
<2-4,Bernadette>Okay, well, I did something

41
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,120
<2-4,Bernadette>可能会让我看起来像一个可爱的呆瓜
<2-4,Bernadette>that will either make me look like a lovable goof

42
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,700
<2-4,Bernadette>或一个该永生被罚下地狱的禽兽
<2-4,Bernadette>or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,310
<2-5,Amy>肯定是可爱的呆瓜
<2-5,Amy>I'm sure it's lovable.

44
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,950
<2-6,Penny>我觉得会是禽兽  说吧  发生什么了
<2-6,Penny>I'm gonna go with monster. What do you got?

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,000
<2-7,Bernadette>我们办公室有位女士要退休了
<2-7,Bernadette>Well, there's this lady in our office who's retiring,

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,440
<2-7,Bernadette>同事们都把自己的祝语
<2-7,Bernadette>and they were passing around one of those big cards

47
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,400
<2-7,Bernadette>-写在一张大卡片里  -我懂
<2-7,Bernadette>- for us to sign... - Okay.

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,840
<2-8,Amy>但没人告诉我
<2-8,Amy>But no one told me she was in

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,250
<2-9,Bernadette>她周末出了严重的车祸
<2-9,Bernadette>a horrible car accident over the weekend

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,670
<2-9,Bernadette>我当时签的不是一张退休贺卡
<2-9,Bernadette>and what I was signing was not a retirement card

51
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,290
<2-9,Bernadette>而是一张"慰问"卡
<2-9,Bernadette>but was actually a "get well" card.

52
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,030
<2-10,Penny>我觉得我选对了
<2-10,Penny>I'm liking my odds here.

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,280
<2-11,Bernadette>所以写在卡片上的话  其实是给
<2-11,Bernadette>So on the card, in the hospital,

54
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,320
<2-11,Bernadette>一个好不容易活下来  至今仍未出院的女人看
<2-11,Bernadette>next to the woman who's clinging to life are the words,

55
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,490
<2-11,Bernadette>"薇薇安  这都是你应得[活该]的"
<2-11,Bernadette>"Hey, Vivian. You deserve this""

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,280
<2-11,Bernadette>"至少你"走"了以后
<2-11,Bernadette>"And at least with you gone,

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,240
<2-11,Bernadette>没有人会偷吃我冰箱里的酸奶"
<2-11,Bernadette>no one will steal my yogurt out of the fridge."

58
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,210
<2-12,Penny>太坏了
<2-12,Penny>No!

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,720
<2-13,Bernadette>-"滚地笑  笑脸"  -我听不下去了
<2-13,Bernadette>- "LOL. Smiley face." - Oh, my gosh.

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,570
<2-15,Bernadette>"附注  希望你一路走好"
<2-15,Bernadette>"P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up."

61
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,130
<2-16,Penny>我一开始就该下重注赌钱
<2-16,Penny>Why didn't I put money on this?

62
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,350
<2-16,Penny>是我经纪人  如果我得到那个角色
<2-16,Penny>Hey, that's my agent. If I got the part,

63
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,150
<2-16,Penny>那也只能屈居"今日最棒"排行榜的第二位
<2-16,Penny>it's still the second best thing I've heard all day.

64
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,140
<2-16,Penny>喂
<2-16,Penny>Hello?

65
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,580
<2-17,Bernadette>我是不是很坏呀
<2-17,Bernadette>Am I a terrible person?

66
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,140
<2-18,Amy>不  那只是误会而已
<2-18,Amy>No. No, it was a mistake.

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,890
<2-19,Bernadette>我当时有想过如果她挂掉
<2-19,Bernadette>Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind

68
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,120
<2-19,Bernadette>就不会看见那张卡片了  那这样坏不坏
<2-19,Bernadette>that she might die and never see the card?

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,490
<2-20,Amy>现在我觉得你在挑战道德底线了
<2-20,Amy>Now I think you're flirting with the line.

70
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,480
<2-20,Amy>是好消息吗
<2-20,Amy>Good news?

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,070
<2-21,Penny>不  我落选了
<2-21,Penny>No, I didn't get it.

72
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,300
<2-22,Bernadette>真可惜
<2-22,Bernadette>I'm so sorry.

73
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,930
<2-23,Amy>-很快会有新角色找你的  -好像是
<2-23,Amy>- You'll get offered something soon.- I kind of did.

74
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,790
<2-24,Penny>我之前拒演的那个垃圾恐怖片
<2-24,Penny>The part in that awful horror movie I passed on

75
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,180
<2-24,Penny>现在又回来找我了
<2-24,Penny>came back around.

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,210
<2-24,Penny>显然如果我愿意  那角色还是我的
<2-24,Penny>Apparently, it's mine if I want it.

77
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,320
<2-25,Bernadette>那你会接吗
<2-25,Bernadette>Are you gonna take it?

78
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,700
<2-26,Penny>我不知道该怎么办
<2-26,Penny>I don't know what to do.

79
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,420
<2-27,Amy>可能哪天被车撞死就不用烦了
<2-27,Amy>Maybe you'll get hit by a car and die.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,150
<2-27,Amy>滚地笑  对吧
<2-27,Amy>LOL, right?

81
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,900
<3-1,Raj>你是艾米丽吧
<3-1,Raj>Emily, right?

82
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,110
<3-2,Emily>是的
<3-2,Emily>Yeah...

83
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,470
<3-3,Raj>我不知道你是否还记得我
<3-3,Raj>I-I don't know if you remember me...

84
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,440
<3-4,Emily>交友网站上的那个
<3-4,Emily>From the dating Web site.

85
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,850
<3-4,Emily>你因为不敢联系我  所以让你朋友代劳
<3-4,Emily>Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to,

86
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,890
<3-4,Emily>而现在却像个疯子一样跟踪我
<3-4,Emily>then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?

87
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,700
<3-5,Raj>没错  我是拉杰什·库萨帕里
<3-5,Raj>Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali.

88
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,050
<3-5,Raj>我只是
<3-5,Raj>Look, uh, I just...

89
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,010
<3-5,Raj>我想跟你道个歉
<3-5,Raj>I wanted to say I'm sorry.

90
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,480
<3-5,Raj>可以吗  你大概是
<3-5,Raj>Okay? You were, like,

91
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,270
<3-5,Raj>我在网上遇到的最酷的人
<3-5,Raj>the coolest person I ever found online,

92
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,940
<3-5,Raj>我当时真的好紧张
<3-5,Raj>and I got really nervous

93
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,580
<3-5,Raj>于是就搞砸了
<3-5,Raj>and I-I just blew it.

94
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,860
<3-6,Emily>都已经过去了
<3-6,Emily>Uh, don't worry about it.

95
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,760
<3-6,Emily>如果能让你好过点
<3-6,Emily>And if it makes you feel any better,

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,300
<3-6,Emily>你还不是我在网上遇到的最奇怪的人
<3-6,Emily>you're not the weirdest guy I've met off the Internet.

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,870
<3-7,Raj>给我个机会试试  你还不知道我的真本事呢
<3-7,Raj>Well, give me a chance-- you don't even know me.

98
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,390
<3-7,Raj>好吧
<3-7,Raj>All right,

99
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,300
<3-8,Emily>现在就给你机会
<3-8,Emily>here's your chance.

100
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,600
<3-8,Emily>什么  真的吗
<3-8,Emily>Wha... Really?

101
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,510
<3-9,Raj>谢谢
<3-9,Raj>Thank you.

102
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,120
<3-9,Raj>命运给了我难得的第二次机会
<3-9,Raj>Fate has given me a rare second chance,

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,720
<3-9,Raj>我对毗湿奴[印度神]发誓  这次我绝不搞砸
<3-9,Raj>and I swear to Vishnu I'm not gonna blow it.

104
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,640
<3-9,Raj>或是给你一个迷人的微笑  说两句正常的话
<3-9,Raj>Or normal words followed by a charming smile.

105
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,920
<4-1,Sheldon>最先上市的游戏机  也就是PS1
<4-1,Sheldon>So, first there was PlayStation-- aka PS1--

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,020
<4-1,Sheldon>然后是PS2  PS3  现在出到PS4了
<4-1,Sheldon>then PS2, PS3 and now PS4.

107
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,250
<4-1,Sheldon>这很符合常理
<4-1,Sheldon>And that makes sense.

108
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,020
<4-1,Sheldon>你就会认为在Xbox之后  会有Xbox2
<4-1,Sheldon>You'd think after Xbox, there'd be Xbox 2.

109
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,810
<4-1,Sheldon>结果不是  下一代叫Xbox360
<4-1,Sheldon>But no, next came Xbox 360.

110
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,960
<4-1,Sheldon>而在360之后  现在出的版本叫Xbox One
<4-1,Sheldon>And now, after 360, comes Xbox One.

111
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,130
<4-1,Sheldon>为什么要叫"One[一]"
<4-1,Sheldon>Why "One"?

112
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,520
<4-1,Sheldon>可能他们想名字的时候只花了"一"秒的时间吧
<4-1,Sheldon>Maybe that's how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.

113
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,620
<4-2,Amy>能帮我拿下黄油吗
<4-2,Amy>Can you get the butter, please?

114
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,420
<4-3,Sheldon>但是  用Xbox One
<4-3,Sheldon>You know, however, with the Xbox One,

115
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,870
<4-3,Sheldon>我可以通过语音指令控制
<4-3,Sheldon>I can control my entire entertainment system

116
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,400
<4-3,Sheldon>我整个娱乐系统
<4-3,Sheldon>using voice commands.

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,210
<4-3,Sheldon>而到目前为止  我都是用莱纳德
<4-3,Sheldon>Up until now, I've had to use Leonard.

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,260
<4-4,Amy>那就买另外一个好了  把黄油递给我
<4-4,Amy>Then get the other one. Pass the butter.

119
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,230
<4-5,Sheldon>买另外...等一下
<4-5,Sheldon>Get... Hang on.

120
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,470
<4-5,Sheldon>我觉得你没把我这难题当一回事
<4-5,Sheldon>I don't feel like you're taking this dilemma seriously.

121
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,210
<4-6,Amy>行  谢尔顿
<4-6,Amy>Fine, Sheldon.

122
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,930
<4-6,Amy>我现在专心听你说
<4-6,Amy>You have my undivided attention.

123
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,820
<4-7,Sheldon>好  PS4的外形
<4-7,Sheldon>Okay, now, the PS4 is

124
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,780
<4-7,Sheldon>有棱有角  霸气犀利
<4-7,Sheldon>more angular and sleek-looking.

125
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,370
<4-8,Amy>-这么帅  -是真的
<4-8,Amy>- No way. - Yeah, well, it's true.

126
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,850
<4-9,Sheldon>但Xbox One体型更大
<4-9,Sheldon>But the larger size of the Xbox One

127
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,350
<4-9,Sheldon>能帮助它免除过热的问题
<4-9,Sheldon>may keep it from overheating.

128
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,610
<4-10,Amy>谁会想要自己的游戏机过热啊
<4-10,Amy>Well, you wouldn't want your gaming system to overheat.

129
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,720
<4-11,Sheldon>不想  当然不想啦
<4-11,Sheldon>No, see? Well, you absolutely would not.

130
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,620
<4-11,Sheldon>而且现在Xbox One
<4-11,Sheldon>And furthermore, the Xbox One

131
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,660
<4-11,Sheldon>随机附送体感控制器呢
<4-11,Sheldon>now comes with a Kinect included.

132
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,080
<4-12,Amy>-随机附送吗  -是啊
<4-12,Amy>- Included?! - Yes!

133
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,290
<4-13,Sheldon>不用额外买了
<4-13,Sheldon>Not sold separately.

134
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,610
<4-13,Sheldon>可是  PS4主机
<4-13,Sheldon>Although...the PS4

135
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,780
<4-13,Sheldon>用的是新款GDDR5内存
<4-13,Sheldon>uses cool new GDDR5 RAM,

136
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,050
<4-13,Sheldon>而Xbox One还在用旧款的DDR3内存
<4-13,Sheldon>while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.

137
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,080
<4-14,Amy>他们为啥还用DDR3内存啊
<4-14,Amy>Why would they still be using DDR3?

138
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
<4-14,Amy>他们脑子坏了吗
<4-14,Amy>Are they nuts?!

139
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,760
<4-15,Sheldon>就是啊  我也是这么想的
<4-15,Sheldon>See? That's what I thought.

140
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,680
<4-15,Sheldon>但他们还加了嵌入式静态存储器
<4-15,Sheldon>But then they go and throw in an eSRAM buffer.

141
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,410
<4-16,Amy>等等  先停一下
<4-16,Amy>Whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

142
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,690
<4-18,Amy>-"他们"是指谁  -Xbox啊
<4-18,Amy>- Who's "they"? - Xbox.

143
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,310
<4-19,Sheldon>-你在开玩笑啊  -我真的不是
<4-19,Sheldon>- You're kidding! - No, I am not!

144
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,640
<4-19,Sheldon>而这个嵌入式静态存储器应该能够
<4-19,Sheldon>And this eSRAM buffer should totally bridge

145
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,470
<4-19,Sheldon>弥补两家用的两种内存之间
<4-19,Sheldon>the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap

146
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,730
<4-19,Sheldon>每秒100G比特的带宽差距啊
<4-19,Sheldon>between the two RAM types.

147
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,570
<4-20,Amy>太残忍了  这让你怎么下决定啊
<4-20,Amy>This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?

148
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,830
<4-20,Amy>所以我才一直举棋不定啊
<4-20,Amy>You see? I don't know!

149
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,790
<4-21,Amy>我到底该怎么做
<4-21,Amy>What should I do?

150
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,230
<4-21,Amy>快给老娘黄油
<4-21,Amy>Please pass the butter!

151
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,440
<5-1,Penny>不是我的问题  是这剧本烂爆了
<5-1,Penny>Okay, it's not me, right? This script is terrible.

152
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,970
<5-1,Penny>是啊

<5-2,Leonard>《杀人恶猿2  猴见猴杀》的电影  期望可"高"了
<5-2,Leonard>Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.

155
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,200
<5-2,Leonard>电影虽烂
<5-2,Leonard>You know, it's still possible

156
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,330
<5-2,Leonard>但你还是有机会能在里面大放异彩啊
<5-2,Leonard>for you to be good in a bad movie.

157
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,450
<5-2,Leonard>好吧
<5-2,Leonard>Okay.

158
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,360
<5-3,Penny>"有时候我觉得我已经能控制

<5-3,Penny>just want to eat them and then kill people."

162
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,330
<5-3,Penny>我到底该怎么做啊
<5-3,Penny>What am I gonna do?

163
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,800
<5-4,Leonard>首先呢  你不该吃那些香蕉
<5-4,Leonard>Well, for starters, I wouldn't eat the bananas.

<5-6,Leonard>Does it at least pay well?

167
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,200
<5-7,Penny>比我在起司工厂打工的钱还少
<5-7,Penny>Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.

168
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,430
<5-8,Leonard>你的经纪人怎么看
<5-8,Leonard>What does your agent think?

<7-25,Raj>她说...她很想我  希望和我聚一聚
<7-25,Raj>She... misses me and wants to get together.

230
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,800
<7-26,Leonard>哇  一男驭二女
<7-26,Leonard>Two women at the same time?

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,710
<7-26,Leonard>厉害哦  小淫棍
<7-26,Leonard>Nice job, playa!

232
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,570
<7-27,Penny>真得这么说话吗
<7-27,Penny>Really?

233
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,980
<7-28,Leonard>是"驭二女"还是"小淫棍"的问题
<7-28,Leonard>Was it the "two women" thing or the "playa"?

234
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,090
<7-28,Leonard>看来是小淫棍
<7-28,Leonard>It was the "Playa".

235
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,080
<8-1,Raj>我该怎么办
<8-1,Raj>What am I supposed to do?

236
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,950
<8-1,Raj>我该如何在艾米丽和露西之间抉择
<8-1,Raj>How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?

237
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,070
<8-2,Howard>何必费神去选  两个一起约嘛
<8-2,Howard>Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.

238
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,500
<8-3,Raj>我可不会同时和两个女生谈恋爱
<8-3,Raj>I can't date two women at once.

239
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,100
<8-3,Raj>一个女人都不剩  那才是我的长项
<8-3,Raj>Zero women-- that's my sweet spot.

240
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,680
<8-4,Penny>只要你没和她们上床
<8-4,Penny>Unless you're sleeping with one of them,

241
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,670
<8-4,Penny>跟其他人约会就没什么关系
<8-4,Penny>seeing other people isn't a big deal.

242
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,830
<8-5,Raj>可要是其中一人问起
<8-5,Raj>But what if one of them asks me

243
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,610
<8-5,Raj>昨天晚上干了什么
<8-5,Raj>what I was up to the night before

244
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,090
<8-5,Raj>而我恰好是和另一个人约会去了
<8-5,Raj>and I was with the other one?

245
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,580
<8-5,Raj>那我该怎么办  骗她吗
<8-5,Raj>Then, what, do I lie?

246
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,470
<8-6,Howard and Bernadette (together)>-没错  -当然
<8-6,Howard and Bernadette (together)>- Yes. - Yes.

247
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,250
<8-7,Bernadette>你说"没错"是什么意思
<8-7,Bernadette>What do you mean, yes?

248
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,730
<8-7,Bernadette>你的"当然"又是什么意思
<8-7,Bernadette>What do you mean, yes?

249
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,920
<8-9,Bernadette>我们约会时  你也和其他女人约会吗
<8-9,Bernadette>Were you seeing other women when we started dating?

250
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,580
<8-10,Howard>我没有  你有跟其他男人约会吗
<8-10,Howard>No. Were you seeing other men?

251
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,050
<8-11,Bernadette>我也没有
<8-11,Bernadette>No.

252
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,190
<8-12,Leonard>你有跟其他男人约会吗
<8-12,Leonard>Were you seeing other men?

253
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,770
<8-13,Penny>没有
<8-13,Penny>No.

254
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,600
<8-14,Leonard>你怎么不问我
<8-14,Leonard>Aren't you gonna ask me?

255
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,030
<8-15,Penny>拜托  有必要问吗
<8-15,Penny>Come on, really?

256
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,070
<9-1,Leonard>多谢你抽空向我们指教
<9-1,Leonard>Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.

257
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,350
<9-2,Wil Wheaton>没事  举手之劳
<9-2,Wil Wheaton>Yeah, happy to help.

258
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,360
<9-2,Wil Wheaton>你有什么问题
<9-2,Wil Wheaton>So, what's going on?

259
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,860
<9-3,Penny>我的事业现在发展
<9-3,Penny>Well, I'm having an impossible time

260
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,450
<9-3,Penny>极其不顺
<9-3,Penny>getting my career off the ground,

261
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,870
<9-3,Penny>正好有个超级烂片找我去演
<9-3,Penny>and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie,

262
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,670
<9-3,Penny>所以我不知道该不该接受这个角色
<9-3,Penny>and I just don't know if I should take it.

263
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,600
<9-4,Wil>我自己也接过一些让我觉得丢人的片子
<9-4,Wil>Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I've been embarrassed by.

264
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,430
<9-5,Penny>《星际迷航》也算不上丢人吧
<9-5,Penny>I wouldn't exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.

265
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,000
<9-6,Wil>我说的不是它
<9-6,Wil>I wasn't.

266
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,890
<9-7,Penny>我也没说它
<9-7,Penny>Me, either.

267
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,810
<9-8,Leonard>所以你怎么看
<9-8,Leonard>So, what do you think,

268
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,560
<9-8,Leonard>做这件事有什么专业上的坏处吗
<9-8,Leonard>is there a professional downside to doing it?

269
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,780
<9-8,Leonard>这很难讲
<9-8,Leonard>Well, it's tricky.

270
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,900
<9-9,Wil>你当然希望选自己喜欢的工作来做
<9-9,Wil>You want to take projects that you're excited about,

271
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,370
<9-9,Wil>但有时你也不得不为五斗米折腰
<9-9,Wil>but sometimes you also have to pay the bills.

272
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,910
<9-9,Wil>当你在做片场演自己
<9-9,Wil>When you're on the set working on something

273
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,120
<9-9,Wil>心里觉得超烂的片子时
<9-9,Wil>that you just know in your heart is bad--

274
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,680
<9-9,Wil>我不是指《星际迷航》
<9-9,Wil>not Star Trek...

275
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,550
<9-10,Penny>把我传送上去[星际迷航台词]   我超爱这戏
<9-10,Penny>Yeah, beam me up. I love it!

276
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,220
<9-11,Wil>反正  这些工作很可能会毁掉你的信心
<9-11,Wil>Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.

277
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,750
<9-12,Penny>我就是担心这个
<9-12,Penny>That's what I'm afraid of.

278
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,420
<9-13,Wil>我小时候出演过《与我同行》
<9-13,Wil>Well, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid,

279
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,890
<9-13,Wil>这片子当时可火爆了
<9-13,Wil>and it was a huge success.

280
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,290
<9-13,Wil>在这之后我演了不少烂片
<9-13,Wil>The terrible movies I did came after that.

281
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,060
<9-13,Wil>想象一下我当时的感受
<9-13,Wil>I mean, imagine how that feels.

282
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,520
<9-14,Leonard>肯定很不堪
<9-14,Leonard>Sounds rough.

283
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,830
<9-15,Wil>相信我  演艺界很残酷
<9-15,Wil>I'm telling you, this business is brutal.

284
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,080
<9-15,Wil>直到今天  我还是很讨厌去试镜
<9-15,Wil>To this day, I hate going on auditions.

285
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,940
<9-15,Wil>我一走进去  就可以感受到
<9-15,Wil>Okay, I walk in, and I can just

286
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,470
<9-15,Wil>他们在想
<9-15,Wil>feel them thinking...

287
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,180
<9-15,Wil>"这孩子以前多可爱
<9-15,Wil>"He was such a cute kid.

288
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,360
<9-15,Wil>时光真是把杀猪刀啊"
<9-15,Wil>What happened to him?"

289
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,020
<9-15,Wil>结果我没能接到这个角色
<9-15,Wil>And then I don't get the job,

290
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,180
<9-15,Wil>也永远不知道原因
<9-15,Wil>and I can never find out why.

291
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,250
<9-15,Wil>老实说  我深受打击
<9-15,Wil>Honestly, I get so depressed,

292
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,380
<9-15,Wil>有时候好几周  我连床都爬不起来
<9-15,Wil>there are entire weeks that I can't even get out of bed.

293
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,080
<9-16,Leonard>你的话对我们帮助太大了
<9-16,Leonard>Okay, this was helpful.

294
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,300
<10-1,Raj>你那位住院的同事最近如何啊
<10-1,Raj>Any news on your coworker who's in the hospital?

295
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,110
<10-2,Bernadette>她好可怜  动了18个小时手术
<10-2,Bernadette>Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours.

296
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,570
<10-2,Bernadette>虽然活下来了  但情况仍然危急
<10-2,Bernadette>She's alive, but she's still in critical condition.

297
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,710
<10-3,Raj>真不幸
<10-3,Raj>Oh, no.

298
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,780
<10-4,Bernadette>唯一的好消息是  她还没来得及看卡片
<10-4,Bernadette>The one bit of good news is they put her

299
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,910
<10-4,Bernadette>就被医生用药物陷入昏迷状态了
<10-4,Bernadette>in a medically induced coma before she read the card.

300
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,270
<10-4,Bernadette>也算是不幸中的万幸吧
<10-4,Bernadette>So, you know, silver linings.

301
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,440
<10-5,Howard>你和我结婚时  就这个样子了吗
<10-5,Howard>Were you like this when I married you?

302
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,960
<10-5,Howard>别担心了  兄弟
<10-5,Howard>Don't worry about it, buddy.

303
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,500
<11-1,Leonard (on phone)>好的  回见
<11-1,Leonard (on phone)>Okay, bye.

<11-1,Leonard (on phone)>That was Wil-- he's feeling a lot better.

305
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,900
<11-1,Leonard (on phone)>他的名字出现在
<11-1,Leonard (on phone)>Apparently, he's 12-down

306
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,370
<11-1,Leonard (on phone)>《电视指南》纵横字迷的第12行
<11-1,Leonard (on phone)>in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.

307
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,870
<11-2,Raj>他有帮你做出决定  到底要不要接那部戏吗
<11-2,Raj>Did he help you make a decision about the movie?

308
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,370
<11-3,Penny>没  那你想好
<11-3,Penny>No. Did you figure out

309
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,920
<11-3,Penny>要如何应对那两个女孩了吗
<11-3,Penny>what you're gonna do about the two girls?

310
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,680
<11-4,Raj>老实说  我想好了
<11-4,Raj>As a matter of fact, I did.

311
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,360
<11-4,Raj>这些年来我深陷恐惧之中
<11-4,Raj>I've spent so many years living in fear,

312
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,300
<11-4,Raj>不敢面对新的事物
<11-4,Raj>saying no to new experiences,

313
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,480
<11-4,Raj>但从现在起
<11-4,Raj>but from now on,

314
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,190
<11-4,Raj>我要积极接受一切
<11-4,Raj>I'm gonna say yes--

315
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,540
<11-4,Raj>接受爱  接受挑战  拥抱生活
<11-4,Raj>yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life;

316
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,350
<11-4,Raj>不管什么事  我都会勇敢地去接受
<11-4,Raj>whatever it may be, the answer's going to be yes.

317
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,920
<11-5,Howard>这家伙绝对孤独终老  对吧
<11-5,Howard>He's gonna die alone, right?

318
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,900
<11-5,Howard>-没错  -绝对的
<11-5,Howard>- Yeah. - Yes.

<12-1,Amy>I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

320
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,360
<12-2,Sheldon>我也以自己为荣
<12-2,Sheldon>You know, I'm proud of me, too.

321
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,730
<12-2,Sheldon>我做了全面的研究
<12-2,Sheldon>I've done all my research,

322
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,660
<12-2,Sheldon>发起了一个非正式的民意投票
<12-2,Sheldon>I conducted an informal poll,

323
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,560
<12-2,Sheldon>所以我现在清楚明白地知道
<12-2,Sheldon>and I've arrived at the rock-solid certainty

324
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,060
<12-2,Sheldon>我做的选择是对的
<12-2,Sheldon>I've made the right choice.

325
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,280
<12-3,Amy>你现在心情一定非常好
<12-3,Amy>Well, that's got to be a good feeling.

326

<12-4,Sheldon>的确如此
<12-4,Sheldon>Oh, it is.

327
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,350
<12-5,Amy>-可是...  -我靠
<12-5,Amy>- Although... - Oh, crap.

328
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,030
<12-6,Sheldon>当年我逼我爸不买录影带系统
<12-6,Sheldon>I had the same feeling when I made my dad

329
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,920
<12-6,Sheldon>而去买另一家产品时  心情也是这样
<12-6,Sheldon>buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.

330
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,460
<12-7,Amy>你还只是小孩而已
<12-7,Amy>You were just a little kid.

331
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,420
<12-8,Sheldon>对  一个选错了格式
<12-8,Sheldon>Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,190
<12-8,Sheldon>录"麦克尼尔和莱尔报导"的孩子
<12-8,Sheldon>to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.

334
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,690
<12-8,Sheldon>我还曾确信
<12-8,Sheldon>I also was certain

335
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,520
<12-8,Sheldon>高清DVD会胜过蓝光呢
<12-8,Sheldon>that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.

336
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,580
<12-9,Amy>你那时候多大
<12-9,Amy>How old were you then?

337
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,410
<12-10,Sheldon>大到应该知道哪种更好
<12-10,Sheldon>Old enough to know better.

338
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,120
<12-10,Sheldon>现在想想
<12-10,Sheldon>You know, and now that I think about it,

339
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,280
<12-10,Sheldon>我曾经站在一箱子iPod前
<12-10,Sheldon>I stood in front of a case of iPods

340
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,600
<12-10,Sheldon>我却买了Zune
<12-10,Sheldon>and I bought a Zune.

341
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,580
<12-11,Amy>什么是Zune
<12-11,Amy>What's a Zune?

342
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,560
<12-12,Sheldon>就是说啊
<12-12,Sheldon>Yeah, exactly.

343
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,060
<12-12,Sheldon>是一款MP3播放器
<12-12,Sheldon>It's an MP3 player

344
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,730
<12-12,Sheldon>制造商正是生产Xbox的这家[微软]
<12-12,Sheldon>brought to us by the makers of Xbox.

<12-13,Amy>不  你在做什么
<12-13,Amy>What... no, what are you doing?

<12-13,Amy>你知道这个好  你都做足研究了
<12-13,Amy>You know it's good. You did the research.

348
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,710
<12-14,Sheldon>但如果我错了呢
<12-14,Sheldon>But what if I'm wrong?

349
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,300
<12-15,Amy>这样吧
<12-15,Amy>You know what?

350
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,260
<12-15,Amy>不如我买给你
<12-15,Amy>How about I buy it for you?

351
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,940
<12-15,Amy>不如
<12-15,Amy>How about

352
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,150
<12-15,Amy>我两个全买给你

354

<12-16,Sheldon>只有一个槽可以用
<12-16,Sheldon>in my entertainment center.

<12-17,Amy>那我就给你买个新电视
<12-17,Amy>Then I'll buy you a new entertainment center.

358
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,970
<12-18,Sheldon>这样吧
<12-18,Sheldon>How about this?

359
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,130
<12-19,Amy>我听说如果扔硬币
<12-19,Amy>I've heard that if you flip a coin,

360
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,040
<12-19,Amy>可以告诉你  你真正的想法
<12-19,Amy>it will tell you how you actually feel.

361
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,350
<12-19,Amy>因为结果要么让你失望
<12-19,Amy>Because you'll either be disappointed

362
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,320
<12-19,Amy>要么令你激动
<12-19,Amy>or excited by the outcome.

363
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,570
<12-20,Sheldon>有意思
<12-20,Sheldon>Interesting.

364

<13-3,Raj>I'm sorry. I can't do this.

377
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,820
<13-3,Raj>我的前女友给我发了电邮
<13-3,Raj>My... my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me,

378
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,120
<13-3,Raj>我周六会和她见面
<13-3,Raj>and I'm seeing her Saturday...

379
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,010
<13-3,Raj>我很高兴你觉得我外套好看  是克鲁牌的
<13-3,Raj>And I'm glad you like it-- it's from J. Crew.

380
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,140
<13-4,Emily>我不明白
<13-4,Emily>I don't understand.

381
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,050
<13-5,Raj>我的朋友们告诉我
<13-5,Raj>My friends told me it was okay

382
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,840
<13-5,Raj>同时和多个人约会没问题
<13-5,Raj>to see more than one person at a time,

383
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,670
<13-5,Raj>但我感觉我在欺骗你
<13-5,Raj>but it-it feels like I'm being deceitful.

384
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,730
<13-6,Emily>你会和她复合吗
<13-6,Emily>Are you getting back together with her?

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,760
<13-7,Raj>我不知道
<13-7,Raj>I-I... I have no idea.

387
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,260
<13-7,Raj>如果是你会怎么做
<13-7,Raj>What would you do?

388
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,020
<13-8,Emily>通常第一次约会  我会谈谈音乐什么的
<13-8,Emily>Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff,

389
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,090
<13-8,Emily>但既然说好了你是怪人  就谈这个吧
<13-8,Emily>but I was promised weird, so let's do this.

390
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,250
<13-8,Emily>你们之前有多认真
<13-8,Emily>How serious were you two?

391
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,160
<13-9,Raj>说实话
<13-9,Raj>Well, to be honest,

392
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,100
<13-9,Raj>我们只约会过四次
<13-9,Raj>we only went on four dates,

393
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,780
<13-9,Raj>拥抱过两次  吻过一次
<13-9,Raj>hugged twice, kissed once,

394
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,340
<13-9,Raj>还有一个充满了性暗示的握手
<13-9,Raj>and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.

395
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,670
<13-10,Emily>慢着
<13-10,Emily>Wait, so...

396
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,170
<13-10,Emily>一个你从没"睡"过的女生发了电邮给你
<13-10,Emily>a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail

397
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,000
<13-10,Emily>让你内疚到你觉得必须告诉我吗
<13-10,Emily>and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,950
<13-11,Raj>是的
<13-11,Raj>Yeah.

399
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,810
<13-12,Emily>挺可爱的
<13-12,Emily>That's kind of adorable.

400
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,610
<13-13,Raj>你说真的吗
<13-13,Raj>Are you... are you sure?

401
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,210
<13-13,Raj>因为一般约会到了这个环节
<13-13,Raj>Because this is the part of the night

402
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,390
<13-13,Raj>都是我说了傻话  女生就直接走了
<13-13,Raj>where I've said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.

403
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,130
<13-14,Emily>我还没走啊
<13-14,Emily>I'm still here.

404
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,340
<13-15,Raj>但现在你让我怀疑你到底有什么毛病
<13-15,Raj>Yeah, but now you make me wonder what's wrong with you.

405
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,580
<13-16,Emily>我们刚认识
<13-16,Emily>We just met.

406
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,410
<13-16,Emily>你不必告诉我  你约会的其他人
<13-16,Emily>You don't need to tell me about other people you're seeing.

407
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,900
<13-16,Emily>真的吗
<13-16,Emily>Really?

408
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,930
<13-17,Raj>因为"我同时和两个女生约会"
<13-17,Raj>Because "I'm dating two women"

409
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,950
<13-17,Raj>基本上是我唯一可吹嘘的潮男事迹
<13-17,Raj>is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.

410
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,130
<14-1,Sheldon>一方面  Xbox One的摄像头更好
<14-1,Sheldon>On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera...

411
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,850
<14-1,Sheldon>但PS4可随意换硬盘
<14-1,Sheldon>but the PS4 has a removable hard drive.

412
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,700
<14-1,Sheldon>有何想法
<14-1,Sheldon>Thoughts?
