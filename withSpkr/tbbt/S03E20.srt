1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,440
<1-1,Penny>靠  我的维萨卡被撤了
<1-1,Penny>Oh, damn, they canceled my Visa.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,210
<1-1,Penny>哦也  新的万事达卡
<1-1,Penny>Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,510
<1-3,Penny>干嘛
<1-3,Penny>What?

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,410
<1-4,Sheldon>我本来想拿信件
<1-4,Sheldon>I was going to get my mail.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,210
<1-4,Sheldon>拿啊
<1-4,Sheldon>Okay.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,350
<1-5,Penny>难道你想通过心灵感应来拿吗
<1-5,Penny>Are... are you hoping to get it telepathically?

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,210
<1-6,Sheldon>你是说意念取物吧
<1-6,Sheldon>I think you mean telekinetically.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,050
<1-6,Sheldon>不是
<1-6,Sheldon>And no.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,230
<1-6,Sheldon>我只是不确定用哪种社交礼节
<1-6,Sheldon>I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,740
<1-6,Sheldon>因为你和莱纳德如今不交媾了
<1-6,Sheldon>now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,590
<1-7,Penny>老天  你就不能说"不再见面交往"吗
<1-7,Penny>God, can we please just say "no longer seeing each other"?

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,100
<1-8,Sheldon>那得真的不见才行
<1-8,Sheldon>Well, we could if it were true.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,540
<1-8,Sheldon>可你们住在同一栋楼里  低头不见抬头见
<1-8,Sheldon>But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time.

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,870
<1-8,Sheldon>唯一改变的变量是交媾
<1-8,Sheldon>The variable which has changed is the coitus.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,230
<1-9,Penny>咱来定个协议 你我继续做朋友 还有你别再说"交媾"
<1-9,Penny>Okay, here's the protocol: you and I are still friends, and you stop saying "coitus."

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,960
<1-10,Sheldon>好啊
<1-10,Sheldon>Good, good.

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,920
<1-10,Sheldon>我很高兴我们还是朋友
<1-10,Sheldon>I'm glad we're still friends.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,870
<1-11,Penny>真的吗
<1-11,Penny>Really?

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,220
<1-12,Sheldon>当然  适应你出现在我日常生活中 可花了我不少功夫
<1-12,Sheldon>Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life.

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,570
<1-12,Sheldon>而我很讨厌白费功夫
<1-12,Sheldon>I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,920
<1-13,Penny>好吧
<1-13,Penny>Right.

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,840
<1-14,Sheldon>再问清楚  我不能跟所有人说交媾 还是只是不能跟你说
<1-14,Sheldon>Just to be clear, do I have to stop saying "coitus" with everyone or just you?

23
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,450
<1-15,Penny>所有人
<1-15,Penny>Everyone.

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,970
<1-16,Sheldon>协议条款真苛刻
<1-16,Sheldon>Harsh terms.

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,390
<1-16,Sheldon>不过没关系  我可以用"性交"代替
<1-16,Sheldon>But all right-- I'll just substitute "intercourse."

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,580
<1-17,Penny>这下好了
<1-17,Penny>Great.

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,950
<1-18,Sheldon>或者用"私通"
<1-18,Sheldon>Or "fornication."

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,230
<1-18,Sheldon>但这个带有批评色彩 还是作为备用吧
<1-18,Sheldon>Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.

29
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,420
<1-19,Penny>你最近怎样
<1-19,Penny>So, how you been?

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,400
<1-20,Sheldon>我的存在是个连续统一体
<1-20,Sheldon>Well, my existence is a continuum,

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,770
<1-20,Sheldon>所以在指定期间的每个时间点都是一样的
<1-20,Sheldon>so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.

32
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,430
<1-21,Penny>你就是逗我玩  是吧
<1-21,Penny>You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,940
<1-22,Sheldon>逗你玩
<1-22,Sheldon>Bazinga.

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,090
<1-23,Penny>莱纳德好吗
<1-23,Penny>How's Leonard doing?

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,540
<1-24,Sheldon>他表面很好
<1-24,Sheldon>He seems all right.

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,220
<1-24,Sheldon>但他花了很长时间
<1-24,Sheldon>Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time

37
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,910
<1-24,Sheldon>盯着你的照片
<1-24,Sheldon>looking at photographs of you

38
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,300
<1-24,Sheldon>嗅着你枕过的枕头
<1-24,Sheldon>and smelling the pillow you slept on.

39
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,780
<1-24,Sheldon>我想起来了
<1-24,Sheldon>Oh, but now that I think of it,

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,900
<1-24,Sheldon>他叫我不要告诉你
<1-24,Sheldon>he asked me not to tell you that.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,180
<1-25,Penny>我会假装没听见
<1-25,Penny>I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,140
<1-26,Sheldon>我宁愿你假装我没说过
<1-26,Sheldon>I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it.

43
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,030
<1-26,Sheldon>你买了意大利妈妈大蒜意粉酱
<1-26,Sheldon>I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.

44
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,610
<1-27,Penny>对
<1-27,Penny>Yep.

45
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,830
<1-28,Sheldon>我妈妈也用这种酱
<1-28,Sheldon>That's the sauce my mother uses.

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,140
<1-28,Sheldon>她喜欢意式烹饪
<1-28,Sheldon>She likes cooking Italian because according to her,

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,830
<1-28,Sheldon>她说罗马人也这么做给耶稣吃
<1-28,Sheldon>that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.

48
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,170
<1-29,Penny>有意思
<1-29,Penny>Interesting.

49
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,780
<1-29,Penny>我改天晚上叫你过来吃
<1-29,Penny>I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,290
<1-30,Sheldon>我现在就饿了
<1-30,Sheldon>I'm hungry now.

51
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,970
<1-31,Penny>好吧
<1-31,Penny>Oh. Um, okay.

52
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,040
<1-31,Penny>那一小时后过来吧
<1-31,Penny>Why don't you give me an hour and come over?

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,510
<1-32,Sheldon>能不能切点热狗丁 加到酱汁里
<1-32,Sheldon>Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?

54
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,080
<1-33,Penny>我没有热狗
<1-33,Penny>I don't have hot dogs.

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,320
<1-34,Sheldon>没关系  我有
<1-34,Sheldon>Oh, it's all right; I do.

56
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,680
<1-34,Sheldon>你就要做我妈妈所说的"美意大餐"
<1-34,Sheldon>Oh! You're in for what my mother calls "a real Eye-talian treat".

57
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,400
<1-35,Leonard>你去哪了
<1-35,Leonard>Hey, where you been?

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,540
<1-36,Sheldon>我刚刚和佩妮聊天呢
<1-36,Sheldon>I was talking with Penny.

59
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,350
<1-37,Howard>你怎么能这样
<1-37,Howard>What's wrong with you?

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,460
<1-37,Howard>你不能和室友的前任一起玩
<1-37,Howard>You can't hang out with your roommate's ex.

61
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,970
<1-37,Howard>这未免太逊了
<1-37,Howard>That's totally uncool.

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,050
<1-38,Leonard>没关系  我不在乎
<1-38,Leonard>No, it's fine. I don't care.

63
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,760
<1-38,Leonard>我已经走出来了
<1-38,Leonard>I'm over it.

64
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,240
<1-39,Raj>对  走出来了  所以他整天都在怨念
<1-39,Raj>Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,790
<1-39,Raj>要发明《黑超战警》里的洗脑装置
<1-39,Raj>about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.

66
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,760
<1-40,Sheldon>他有进展了吗
<1-40,Sheldon>Is he making any progress?

67
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,410
<1-40,Sheldon>因为我想忘掉本·阿弗莱克居然演过《超胆侠》
<1-40,Sheldon>Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.

68
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,500
<1-41,Howard>本·阿弗莱克也会想洗脑的
<1-41,Howard>So would Ben Affleck.

69
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,790
<1-41,Howard>重点是  面对这种情况 你得做出选择
<1-41,Howard>The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides.

70
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,270
<1-41,Howard>要么选莱纳德队  要么选择佩妮队
<1-41,Howard>You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.

71
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,710
<1-42,Sheldon>哪个是选剩下的
<1-42,Sheldon>Which one picks last?

72
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,250
<1-43,Howard>什么
<1-43,Howard>What?

73
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,730
<1-44,Sheldon>我通常都只能在选剩下的那队
<1-44,Sheldon>Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last.

74
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,510
<1-44,Sheldon>除非有坐轮椅的孩子一起玩
<1-44,Sheldon>Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.

75
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,990
<1-45,Leonard>谢尔顿  我给你买了陈皮鸡丁
<1-45,Leonard>Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,440
<1-45,Leonard>你应该饿了吧
<1-45,Leonard>I hope you're hungry.

77
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,480
<1-46,Sheldon>我当然饿了
<1-46,Sheldon>Well, of course I'm hungry.

78
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,760
<1-46,Sheldon>而且我没打算跟别的队吃饭
<1-46,Sheldon>And as I have no plans to eat with any other team,

79
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,640
<1-46,Sheldon>我会津津有味地 吃光陈皮鸡丁
<1-46,Sheldon>I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto.

80
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,860
<1-47,Leonard>好吧
<1-47,Leonard>Okay.

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
<1-48,Sheldon>只是出于好奇  我们还有热狗吗
<1-48,Sheldon>Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,580
<1-49,Leonard>不知道  怎么了
<1-49,Leonard>I don't know. Why?

83
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,990
<1-50,Sheldon>吃饭时随便聊聊而已
<1-50,Sheldon>Just making dinner conversation.

84
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,870
<1-50,Sheldon>加油  小莱队
<1-50,Sheldon>Go, Team Leonard!

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,300
<1-50,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-50,Sheldon>第三季第二十集

86
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,870
<2-1,Howard>啊  太好吃了
<2-1,Howard>Oh, God, this is good.

87
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,540
<2-2,Raj>我问你个问题
<2-2,Raj>Let me ask you a question.

88
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,440
<2-2,Raj>你觉得你会因为
<2-2,Raj>Do you believe you're going to go to hell

89
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,670
<2-2,Raj>吃糖醋排骨而下地狱吗
<2-2,Raj>for eating sweet and sour pork?

90
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,210
<2-3,Howard>犹太人不相信有地狱
<2-3,Howard>Jews don't have hell.

91
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,480
<2-3,Howard>我们相信有胃酸倒流
<2-3,Howard>We have acid reflux.

92
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,280
<2-4,Leonard>你要吃最后一只饺子吗  谢尔顿
<2-4,Leonard>Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,580
<2-5,Sheldon>当然
<2-5,Sheldon>Certainly.

94
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,610
<2-5,Sheldon>我又没有因为很快要吃第二餐
<2-5,Sheldon>It's not like I have to moderate my food intake

95
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,210
<2-5,Sheldon>而故意限制食物摄入量
<2-5,Sheldon>because I'm planning on eating again very shortly.

96
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,340
<2-6,Leonard>大家今晚想玩什么
<2-6,Leonard>So, you guys want to do something tonight?

97
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,940
<2-7,Howard>我不行 我要去水中有氧运动班接我妈
<2-7,Howard>Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class.

98
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:05,900
<2-7,Howard>十八个超重妇女在游泳池里 甩着肥大的手臂
<2-7,Howard>18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool.

99
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,170
<2-7,Howard>就像海洋世界里的海牛
<2-7,Howard>Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.

100
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,940
<2-8,Leonard>你呢  拉杰
<2-8,Leonard>What about you, Raj?

101
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,280
<2-9,Raj>这算什么
<2-9,Raj>Oh, there it is:

102
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,710
<2-9,Raj>你没有女朋友了
<2-9,Raj>now that you don't have a girlfriend,

103
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,680
<2-9,Raj>就又想跟我玩了
<2-9,Raj>you want to hang out with me again.

104
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,180
<2-10,Leonard>-我什么时候没跟你玩了  -少来了
<2-10,Leonard>- I never stopped hanging out with you. - Oh, please,

105
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,350
<2-11,Raj>大家都清楚你没有人了 才会来找我
<2-11,Raj>we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options.

106
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,020
<2-11,Raj>如果我们是正义联盟  我就是海王子
<2-11,Raj>If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,970
<2-12,Howard>我倒希望你是海王子
<2-12,Howard>I wish you were Aquaman.

108
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,670
<2-12,Howard>我就能派你去老人池里把我妈舀出来
<2-12,Howard>Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.

109
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,280
<2-13,Sheldon>抱歉  我渴了  我要去冰箱里
<2-13,Sheldon>Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator

110
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,110
<2-13,Sheldon>拿点清凉饮料喝
<2-13,Sheldon>and get myself a refreshing beverage.

111
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,880
<2-14,Leonard>算了  我今晚就一个人过吧
<2-14,Leonard>You know what? I'll just spend the evening alone.

112
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,890
<2-15,Raj>怎么  我突然就不配陪你了
<2-15,Raj>What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you?

113
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,190
<2-16,Sheldon>我最爱饮料了
<2-16,Sheldon>I do so love beverages.

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,130
<2-16,Sheldon>我现在要去饭后散步了
<2-16,Sheldon>Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.

115
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,900
<2-17,Leonard>你什么时候开始饭后散步了
<2-17,Leonard>Since when do you take after-dinner walks?

116
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,000
<2-18,Howard>你什么时候开始散步了
<2-18,Howard>Yeah, since when do you take walks?

117
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,810
<2-19,Sheldon>我在网上看过一篇论文  饭后百步走
<2-19,Sheldon>I read a study online that walking after a meal

118
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,610
<2-19,Sheldon>不仅有助于消化  还能增加5-羟色胺的含量
<2-19,Sheldon>not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin,

120
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,340
<2-19,Sheldon>而且你们也知道的  如果说相比提神饮料
<2-19,Sheldon>and you know me, if there's one thing I like

121
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,110
<2-19,Sheldon>我更喜欢什么  那肯定就是5-羟色胺了  拜拜
<2-19,Sheldon>more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye.

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,420
<2-20,Howard>等等  我和你一起走
<2-20,Howard>Hold on. I'll walk down with you.

123
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,320
<2-21,Sheldon>没那个必要吧
<2-21,Sheldon>That's not necessary.

124
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,650
<2-21,Sheldon>你先走吧
<2-21,Sheldon>You can go first.

125
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,060
<2-22,Howard>要么咱俩一起走
<2-22,Howard>Or we could go together.

126
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,960
<2-23,Sheldon>我想不出什么理由拒绝你
<2-23,Sheldon>I can't think of a reason why not.

127
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,060
<2-24,Howard>咱们走吧
<2-24,Howard>Let's go.

128
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,530
<2-25,Sheldon>等一下
<2-25,Sheldon>Hold on.

129
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,700
<2-25,Sheldon>没事  我还是想不出什么理由
<2-25,Sheldon>Nope, no reason.

130
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,610
<2-26,Raj>我好想你
<2-26,Raj>I've missed you.

<3-1,Sheldon>行了  代我向你妈妈问好
<3-1,Sheldon>All right, say hello to your mother for me.

<1-47,Leonard>行啊
<1-47,Leonard>Okay.

133
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,720
<3-3,Sheldon>干嘛
<3-3,Sheldon>What?

134
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,490
<3-4,Howard>你刚说你要去散步的
<3-4,Howard>You said you were going for a walk.

135
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,190
<3-5,Sheldon>我又没说要去外面散步
<3-5,Sheldon>I didn't say outside.

136
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,330
<3-6,Howard>然后呢  你就打算来来回回地跑楼梯吗
<3-6,Howard>So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?

137
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,900
<3-7,Sheldon>不会  当然不会
<3-7,Sheldon>No, of course not.

138
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,770
<3-7,Sheldon>那样的话就太可疑了
<3-7,Sheldon>That would be odd and suspicious behavior.

139
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,770
<3-8,Woman’s voice>到这儿来  拉塞尔  过来呀  宝贝儿
<3-8,Woman’s voice>Here, Russell! Here, boy!

140

<3-9,Howard>你往哪边走
<3-9,Howard>Which way are you going?

141
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,740
<3-9,Howard>"你" 往哪边走
<3-9,Howard>Which way are "you" going?

142
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,200
<3-11,Howard>我把摩托车停在街那边了
<3-11,Howard>I parked my scooter down the block.

143
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,170
<3-12,Sheldon>我走另一边  拜拜
<3-12,Sheldon>I'm going the other way. Bye.

144
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,670
<3-12,Sheldon>拜拜
<3-12,Sheldon>Bye.

145
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,710
<3-13,Howard>其实是停在这边
<3-13,Howard>Actually, I'm this way.

146
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,850
<3-13,Howard>这是热狗的味道吗
<3-13,Howard>Do I smell hot dogs?

147
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,780
<3-14,Sheldon>不是  我是说  我不知道你闻到了什么
<3-14,Sheldon>No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.

148
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,820
<3-15,Howard>我绝对闻到了生热狗的味道
<3-15,Howard>I definitely smell raw hot dog.

149
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,120
<3-16,Sheldon>估计是你的脑子里有肿瘤吧
<3-16,Sheldon>Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor.

150
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,420
<3-17,Howard>好了  散步愉快
<3-17,Howard>All right, have a nice walk.

152
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,760
<3-19,Howard>你最好站开点儿
<3-19,Howard>You might want to stand back.

153
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,160
<3-19,Howard>寡人的坐骑有13马力呢
<3-19,Howard>I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.

<3-20,Sheldon>Nice doggie.

156
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,970
<3-20,Sheldon>估计你是闻到热狗的香味了
<3-20,Sheldon>I bet you think you smell hot dogs.

157
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,640
<3-20,Sheldon>看  有猫咪

<4-1,Sheldon>剩下的热狗被我拿去保命了
<4-1,Sheldon>I had to trade the others for my life.

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,540
<5-1,Raj>喂  莱纳德
<5-1,Raj>Hey, Leonard?

00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,210
<5-3,Raj>我有一年没做爱了

<5-5,Raj>我想出去找个女人
<5-5,Raj>I want to go out and meet a woman.

<5-7,Raj>那就去呗  -我要找个帮手
<5-7,Raj>- So, go.  - Well, I need a wingman.

170
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,850
<5-7,Raj>我不想让自己看着像个失败的剩男
<5-7,Raj>I don't want to come off like a lonely loser.

171
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,360
<5-8,Leonard>你觉得我跟你去你就不剩了吗
<5-8,Leonard>And you think "my" presence will help with that?

172
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,660
<5-9,Raj>对呀
<5-9,Raj>Well, I do.

173
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,360
<5-9,Raj>有你在旁边  我有更有把握了
<5-9,Raj>Next to you, I'll look like a catch.

174
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,930
<5-10,Leonard>我今晚不会出去的  拉杰
<5-10,Leonard>I'm not going out tonight, Raj.

175
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,530
<5-10,Leonard>好吧
<5-10,Leonard>All right.

176
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,060
<5-11,Raj>你介意我到你房间去
<5-11,Raj>Would you mind if I went to your room

177
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,170
<5-11,Raj>下载几部亚系A片看吗
<5-11,Raj>and downloaded some Asian pornography?

178
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,700
<5-12,Leonard>非常介意
<5-12,Leonard>Very much.

179
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
<5-13,Raj>我可以不看亚系的
<5-13,Raj>Doesn't have to be Asian.

180
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,540
<5-14,Leonard>别担心  总有一天你会遇见一个好姑娘的
<5-14,Leonard>Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday.

181
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,680
<5-16,Leonard>-不可能的  -绝对可能  而且还很漂亮
<5-16,Leonard>- No, I won't.  - Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful.

182
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
<5-16,Leonard>善良  性感  幽默
<5-16,Leonard>And kind and sexy and funny

183
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,510
<5-16,Leonard>绝对是你梦中情人的样子
<5-16,Leonard>and everything you ever wanted in a woman.

184
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,580
<5-17,Raj>你真这么觉得
<5-17,Raj>You really think so?

185
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,320
<5-18,Leonard>没错  你会一发不可收拾地 爱上她  向她敞开心扉
<5-18,Leonard>I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart.

186
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,190
<5-18,Leonard>然后她会拿走你的心  残忍地撕成碎片
<5-18,Leonard>And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.

187
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,590
<5-19,Raj>但我们到时候会先上床  对吧
<5-19,Raj>But we'll have sex first, right?

188
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,670
<6-1,Sheldon>真正的美意大餐
<6-1,Sheldon>That's Eye-talian.

189
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,370
<6-2,Penny>莱纳德不介意你过来吧
<6-2,Penny>So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?

190
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,240
<6-2,Penny>不介意
<6-2,Penny>Oh, yes.

191
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,040
<6-3,Sheldon>其实他说了  "我没事  我不在乎"
<6-3,Sheldon>In fact, he said, "I'm fine. I don't care."

192
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,880
<6-3,Sheldon>而且他的语气绝对不会
<6-3,Sheldon>And he in no way said it in a manner

193
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,750
<6-3,Sheldon>让人觉得他在掩饰心中的
<6-3,Sheldon>which would lead one to believe that he was covering up

194
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,680
<6-3,Sheldon>痛苦与背叛
<6-3,Sheldon>feelings of anguish and betrayal.

195
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,690
<6-4,Penny>-很好嘛  -我还要
<6-4,Penny>- Well, good.  - I'm also

196
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,420
<6-5,Sheldon>很高兴地告诉你他曾为你大声痛哭
<6-5,Sheldon>pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.

197
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,960
<6-6,Penny>他哭过
<6-6,Penny>He's been crying?

198
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,190
<6-7,Sheldon>我又漏说了一件
<6-7,Sheldon>Oh, I believe that was something else

199
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,560
<6-7,Sheldon>不该跟你提起的事
<6-7,Sheldon>I wasn't supposed to mention.

200
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,860
<6-8,Penny>哦  天哪  我好难过
<6-8,Penny>Oh, God, I feel terrible.

201
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,130
<6-9,Sheldon>你也胃疼吗
<6-9,Sheldon>Do you have a stomachache, too?

202
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,770
<6-10,Penny>没有啊  怎么了  你胃疼吗
<6-10,Penny>No. Why, do you?

203
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,470
<6-11,Sheldon>不疼
<6-11,Sheldon>No.

204
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,170
<6-12,Penny>那你为啥问我是不是也胃疼
<6-12,Penny>Why did you ask if I had one, too?

205
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,210
<6-13,Sheldon>就是吃饭的时候随便聊聊
<6-13,Sheldon>Just making polite dinner conversation.

206
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,570
<6-13,Sheldon>该你说了
<6-13,Sheldon>Your turn.

207
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,810
<6-13,Sheldon>好吧
<6-13,Sheldon>All right.

208
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,980
<6-14,Penny>那你最近有啥新鲜事儿吗
<6-14,Penny>So, what's new in your life?

209
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,420
<6-15,Sheldon>我的新鞋不适合跑步
<6-15,Sheldon>Well, my new shoes are not made for running.

210
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,250
<6-16,Penny>你去跑步了
<6-16,Penny>Have you been running?

211
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,990
<6-16,Penny>没有
<6-16,Penny>No.

212
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,060
<6-17,Sheldon>这只是我的怀疑
<6-17,Sheldon>It's just a suspicion I have.

213
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,730
<6-18,Penny>-我很高兴你这么喜欢我的手艺  -没错
<6-18,Penny>- I'm so glad you like it.  -I do.

214
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,530
<6-19,Sheldon>莱纳德从来没给我做过饭
<6-19,Sheldon>Leonard never cooks for me.

215
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,930
<6-20,Penny>估计是因为莱纳德不会做饭吧
<6-20,Penny>Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook.

216
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,470
<6-21,Sheldon>你也不会做饭  但是你为我做了这些
<6-21,Sheldon>You can't cook and you made me this.

217
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,370
<6-21,Sheldon>随便啦
<6-21,Sheldon>Whatever.

218
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,410
<6-22,Penny>对了  还有芝士蛋糕在冰箱里
<6-22,Penny>Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.

219
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,910
<6-23,Sheldon>天  我要下犹太人的地狱了[胃酸倒流]
<6-23,Sheldon>Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.

220
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,600
<7-1,Raj>你看这个
<7-1,Raj>Look at this.

221
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
<7-1,Raj>你觉得她这动作是真的呢
<7-1,Raj>Do you think she's really doing that

222
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,370
<7-1,Raj>还是PS出来的
<7-1,Raj>or is it PhotoShop?

223
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,940
<7-2,Leonard>我很确定玛莎·斯图尔特绝对不会光着身子
<7-2,Leonard>I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked

225
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,010
<7-2,Leonard>和一屋子的日本大胖子呆在一起
<7-2,Leonard>with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.

226
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,540
<7-3,Raj>你又不知道
<7-3,Raj>You don't know that.

227
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,580
<7-3,Raj>监狱能改变一个人的
<7-3,Raj>Prison changes people.

228
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,100
<7-4,Leonard>你刚去哪儿了
<7-4,Leonard>Hey, where you been?

229
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,310
<7-5,Sheldon>跟你说了嘛  散步啊
<7-5,Sheldon>I told you, walking.

230
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,470
<7-6,Leonard>你散了一个半小时的步
<7-6,Leonard>For an hour and a half?

231
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,840
<7-7,Sheldon>我迷路了
<7-7,Sheldon>I got lost.

232
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,310
<7-8,Leonard>你怎么会迷路的  你的手机上有GPS啊
<7-8,Leonard>How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.

233
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,150
<7-9,Sheldon>卫星出故障了  有太阳风暴
<7-9,Sheldon>Satellites are down. Solar flares.

234
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,550
<7-10,Raj>这会儿没有太阳风暴
<7-10,Raj>There are no solar flares right now.

235
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,780
<7-11,Sheldon>不对  有的
<7-11,Sheldon>Yes, there are.

236
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,150
<7-12,Raj>老兄  我是搞天体物理的
<7-12,Raj>Dude, I'm an astrophysicist.

237
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,650
<7-12,Raj>要是有太阳风暴的话  我绝对会知道
<7-12,Raj>If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.

238
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,690
<7-13,Sheldon>抱歉  我说错了
<7-13,Sheldon>I'm sorry. I misspoke.

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,560
<7-13,Sheldon>我刚才其实想说我手机没电了
<7-13,Sheldon>What I meant to say was my battery died.

240
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,730
<7-14,Leonard>他到底是怎么回事啊
<7-14,Leonard>What the hell was that about?

241
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,200
<7-14,Leonard>不知道
<7-14,Leonard>I don't know.

242
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,570
<7-15,Raj>你觉得这真的是希拉里·克林顿在和欧普拉嘿咻吗
<7-15,Raj>Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?

243
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,100
<7-16,Leonard>哦  我们真得给你找个小妞了
<7-16,Leonard>Oh, we really need to get you a girl.

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,360
<8-4,Leonard>你想干嘛  谢尔顿
<8-4,Leonard>What do you want, Sheldon?

250
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,030
<8-5,Sheldon>可能现在不是时候
<8-5,Sheldon>Maybe this isn't a good time.

251
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,860
<8-6,Leonard>快说你干嘛吵醒我  不然我对天发誓我会杀了你
<8-6,Leonard>Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.

252
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,530
<8-7,Sheldon>你真觉得用死亡威胁我
<8-7,Sheldon>Do you really think death threats

253
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,700
<8-7,Sheldon>是展开谈话的恰当方式吗
<8-7,Sheldon>are an appropriate way to begin this conversation?

254
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,800
<8-7,Sheldon>有时候  你的社交能力少得简直让我震惊
<8-7,Sheldon>Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.

255
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,870
<8-8,Leonard>你到底想干嘛
<8-8,Leonard>What do you want?

256
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,070
<8-9,Sheldon>你最好先坐下

257
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,880
<8-10,Leonard>我正躺着呢
<8-10,Leonard>I'm in bed!

258

260
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,080
<8-12,Leonard>谢尔顿
<8-12,Leonard>Sheldon!

261
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,720
<8-13,Sheldon>我一直在背着你见佩妮
<8-13,Sheldon>I've been seeing Penny behind your back.

262
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,160
<8-13,Sheldon>好吧
<8-13,Sheldon>Okay...

263
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,060
<8-14,Leonard>你说你"见佩妮"  到底什么意思
<8-14,Leonard>When you say "seeing Penny," what exactly does that mean?

264
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,330
<8-15,Sheldon>我们昨晚一起吃晚餐了
<8-15,Sheldon>We had dinner last night.

265
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,300
<8-17,Sheldon>她给我做了意粉加热狗丁
<8-17,Sheldon>She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it.

266
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,170
<8-15,Sheldon>虽然热狗丁很少
<8-15,Sheldon>Well, little hot dog.

267
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,170
<8-15,Sheldon>因为还有五根热狗我都给那条真的狗狗吃了
<8-15,Sheldon>I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog.

268
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,510
<8-15,Sheldon>很大只的真的狗狗
<8-15,Sheldon>A real, big dog.

269
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,440
<8-15,Sheldon>是条该死的猎狗
<8-15,Sheldon>A hell hound.

270
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,140
<8-15,Sheldon>我好像离题太远了
<8-15,Sheldon>Tangential to the primary story.

271
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,240
<8-15,Sheldon>等下再绕回来说如何
<8-15,Sheldon>How about I circle back to it?

272
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,380
<8-15,Sheldon>好
<8-15,Sheldon>Fine.

273
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,280
<8-16,Leonard>你为什么要跟佩妮一起晚餐
<8-16,Leonard>Why did you have dinner with Penny?

274
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,380
<8-17,Sheldon>我说过了  她做了意粉加热狗丁
<8-17,Sheldon>I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs.

275
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,750
<8-17,Sheldon>我喜欢吃意粉加热狗丁
<8-17,Sheldon>I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.

276
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,950
<8-18,Leonard>那你为什么还跟我们一起吃中餐
<8-18,Leonard>Then why did you have Chinese food with us?

277
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,790
<8-19,Sheldon>我是怕你不高兴
<8-19,Sheldon>I didn't want to upset you.

278
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,520
<8-19,Sheldon>霍华德说得很清楚  我应该先效忠于
<8-19,Sheldon>Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be

279
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,690
<8-19,Sheldon>男同志  而不是为钱卖身的女人们
<8-19,Sheldon>to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.

280
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,800
<8-20,Leonard>莫非他说的是  兄弟比妓女重要
<8-20,Leonard>Is it possible he said, "Bros before hos"?

281
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,440
<8-21,Sheldon>对  我改了下措辞  避免提到妓女这个词
<8-21,Sheldon>Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.

282
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,780
<8-22,Leonard>谢尔顿  你跟佩妮做不做朋友我都无所谓
<8-22,Leonard>Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny.

283
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,410
<8-23,Sheldon>这么说  一直困扰我让我噩梦连连的
<8-23,Sheldon>Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me

284
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,450
<8-23,Sheldon>这种情绪波动  真的是完全不应该啊
<8-23,Sheldon>from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?

285
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,450
<8-24,Leonard>没错
<8-24,Leonard>Yes.

286
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,020
<8-25,Sheldon>要是我奶奶肯定会说
<8-25,Sheldon>Well... then as my meemaw would say,

287
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,320
<8-25,Sheldon>我们在这宰猪待客  可居然没人想吃培根[都不领情]
<8-25,Sheldon>"Looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon."

288
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,260
<8-26,Leonard>我想是的
<8-26,Leonard>I guess not.

289
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,160
<8-27,Sheldon>现在  之前我承诺过的  那个题外话
<8-27,Sheldon>And now, as promised, the tangent.

290
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,600
<8-27,Sheldon>谢尔顿大战猎狗记
<8-27,Sheldon>Sheldon and the Hell Hound.

<9-1,Penny>我还是回头再来吧

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,190
<9-6,Leonard>我会不高兴
<9-6,Leonard>about you hanging out with him.
