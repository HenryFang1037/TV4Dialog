<1-1,Amy (on Skype)>我... 不... 你... 电邮...
<1-1,Amy (on Skype)>I didn't understand your e-mail.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,600
<1-2,Sheldon>你能再说一次吗  你说话断断续续
<1-2,Sheldon>Uh, can you repeat that? You're breaking up.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,590
<1-3,Amy>我... 看不懂... 你的电邮...
<1-3,Amy>I didn't understand your e-mail.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,420
<1-4,Sheldon>我得加入点巧思
<1-4,Sheldon>Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,490
<1-4,Sheldon>因为我笔记本电脑S  R  M键坏了
<1-4,Sheldon>because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,310
<1-5,Amy>"亲爱滴阿米  能拜偷你
<1-5,Amy>"Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,240
<1-5,Amy>他把s用th  r用w   m用b代替
<1-5,Amy>原句是"明天有空载我去火车玩具店吗"

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,240
<1-5,Amy>宁天有空载偶企火车玩鸡店吗"
<1-5,Amy>to the twain thtowe thubtibe tobowow?"

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,560
<1-6,Sheldon>你同意吗
<1-6,Sheldon>So, is that a yes?

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,200
<1-7,Amy>谢尔顿  你为什么不买台新电脑
<1-7,Amy>Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,180
<1-7,Amy>你知道你那台该淘汰了
<1-7,Amy>You know that one's out-of-date.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,470
<1-8,Sheldon>但我喜欢这台电脑
<1-8,Sheldon>Oh, but I like this computer.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,140
<1-9,Amy>画质越来越烂  声音越来越断
<1-9,Amy>The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,660
<1-10,Sheldon>抱歉  我没听到你说的
<1-10,Sheldon>I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,500
<1-9,Amy>显卡要挂了
<1-9,Amy>The video is failing,

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,890
<1-9,Amy>声卡要死了
<1-9,Amy>and the sound is cutting out.

17
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,930
<1-9,Amy>抱歉  再一次  声音断断续续
<1-9,Amy>I'm sorry, one more time. The sound is cutting out.

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,870
<1-12,Sheldon>我看不清
<1-12,Sheldon>I can't read that!

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,170
<1-9,Amy>显卡不行了
<1-9,Amy>The video is failing!

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,350
<1-13,Amy>买... 新电...
<1-13,Amy>Get a new computer.

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,800
<1-14,Sheldon>啥
<1-14,Sheldon>What?

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,670
<1-13,Amy>买... 电脑...
<1-13,Amy>Get a new computer.

24
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,070
<1-14,Sheldon>虾密
<1-14,Sheldon>What?!

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,650
<1-13,Amy>-喂  -快买个新电脑
<1-13,Amy>- Hello? - Get a new computer!

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,660
<2-1,Leonard>这挺酷啊
<2-1,Leonard>This is cool.

37
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,890
<2-1,Leonard>我们上一次一起合作造东西是什么时候
<2-1,Leonard>When was the last time you and I built something together?

38
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,160
<2-2,Howard>科学方面的东西  大概是一年多前
<2-2,Howard>Scientifically? A little over a year ago.

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,620
<2-2,Howard>乐高积木  上周在我房里
<2-2,Howard>LEGOs? Last week in my room.

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,290
<2-3,Leonard>如果有一个"一摸就解体的
<2-3,Leonard>If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,340
<2-3,Leonard>千禧年猎鹰号乐高"诺贝尔奖  我们一定赢
<2-3,Leonard>that fall apart when you pick them up, we'd be set.

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,790
<2-4,Penny>两位
<2-4,Penny>Hey, guys!

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,280
<2-5,Leonard>你们怎么来了
<2-5,Leonard>What are you doing here?

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,830
<2-6,Bernadette>我们听说这里有性感科学家
<2-6,Bernadette>We heard there were some sexy scientists

45
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,410
<2-6,Bernadette>-整个周末在努力工作  -是啊
<2-6,Bernadette>- working hard all weekend. - Yeah,

46
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,610
<2-7,Penny>所以带午餐来给你们  然后去找性感科学家
<2-7,Penny>so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for 'em.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,990
<2-8,Leonard>汤  三明治  加羞辱
<2-8,Leonard>Soup, sandwiches and emasculation,

48
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,940
<2-8,Leonard>就像我妈做的午餐一样
<2-8,Leonard>just like my mom used to make.

49
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,060
<2-9,Penny>情况如何
<2-9,Penny>So, how's it goin'?

50
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,220
<2-10,Leonard>还行  进度有些慢
<2-10,Leonard>Good. Slow.

51
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,990
<2-11,Howard>有很多无聊的前置工作得做  但只要弄好这部分
<2-11,Howard>There's a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that

52
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,270
<2-11,Howard>进度应该就会加快
<2-11,Howard>it should go quicker.

53
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,950
<2-12,Penny>有什么事我们能帮忙吗
<2-12,Penny>Is there anything we can do to help?

54
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,860
<2-13,Leonard>其实这部分不需要什么技术性
<2-13,Leonard>You know what, this part isn't that technical.

55
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,060
<2-13,Leonard>你们还真能帮上忙
<2-13,Leonard>You actually could.

56
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,850
<2-14,Penny>真的吗  被你抓到我胡扯  那我认命吧
<2-14,Penny>Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,910
<2-15,Bernadette>我们真能帮上忙吗
<2-15,Bernadette>Can we really help?

58
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,620
<2-16,Howard>我们焊接这些板的时候  如果你们
<2-16,Howard>While we finish soldering these boards, it'd be great

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,070
<2-16,Howard>可以帮忙用铁氟龙胶带缠住这些管件就太好了
<2-16,Howard>if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.

60
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,340
<2-17,Leonard>我缠一个给你们看
<2-17,Leonard>I'll show you how to do one.

61
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,680
<2-18,Penny>你觉得如果你们
<2-18,Penny>Hey, w-wouldn't it be funny

62
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,400
<2-18,Penny>辛辛苦苦干了这么多年
<2-18,Penny>if after all your years of hard work,

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,680
<2-18,Penny>最后是我取得科学上突破  会不会很好笑
<2-18,Penny>I'm the one who makes a scientific breakthrough?

64
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,320
<2-18,Penny>他不觉得好笑
<2-18,Penny>He doesn't think that's funny.

65
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,530
<3-1,Amy>我以最快的速度赶来了
<3-1,Amy>I got here as quickly as I could.

66
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,990
<3-2,Sheldon>你来晚了
<3-2,Sheldon>You're too late.

68
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,490
<3-3,Amy>谢尔顿  这太智障
<3-3,Amy>Sheldon, this is silly.

69
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,670
<3-4,Sheldon>你的实验室猴子死掉的时候  你也很伤心啊
<3-4,Sheldon>You got emotional when that lab monkey died.

70
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,720
<3-5,Amy>那只猴子用手语对我说过"我爱你"
<3-5,Amy>That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.

71
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,880
<3-5,Amy>这下好了
<3-5,Amy>Great.

72
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,920
<3-6,Sheldon>这曲子要卡在我脑子里一整天了
<3-6,Sheldon>Now I'm gonna have that song in my head all day.

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,290
<3-7,Amy>请节哀顺变
<3-7,Amy>Look, I'm-I'm sorry for your loss,

74
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,270
<3-7,Amy>但我有个东西
<3-7,Amy>but I think I have something

75
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,310
<3-7,Amy>能让你开心起来
<3-7,Amy>that might make you feel better.

76
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,720
<3-7,Amy>我给你买了台新电脑
<3-7,Amy>I got you a new computer!

77
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,580
<3-8,Sheldon>你怎么能这么做
<3-8,Sheldon>How could you do that?

78
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,380
<3-9,Amy>做什么
<3-9,Amy>Do what?

79
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,480
<3-10,Sheldon>选购新笔电是非常私人的仪式
<3-10,Sheldon>Choosing a new laptop is an incredibly personal ritual.

80
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,610
<3-10,Sheldon>你夺走了我数周的脑海里烦心苦恼
<3-10,Sheldon>You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought,

81
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,150
<3-10,Sheldon>各种无聊的搜索研究
<3-10,Sheldon>tedious research,

82
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,580
<3-10,Sheldon>多个被我的犹豫不决所填满的无眠之夜...
<3-10,Sheldon>sleepless nights filled with indecision. I j...

83
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,840
<3-10,Sheldon>难道我今天失去的还不够多吗
<3-10,Sheldon>Haven't I lost enough today?

84
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,160
<3-11,Amy>店里的那个店员说这台很赞啊
<3-11,Amy>Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
<3-12,Sheldon>那个店员咩
<3-12,Sheldon>Oh! Oh, the guy!

86
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,850
<3-12,Sheldon>原谅小的
<3-12,Sheldon>Oh, pardon me.

87
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,390
<3-12,Sheldon>我不知道是"那个店员"说的
<3-12,Sheldon>I-I didn't realize you'd spoken to the guy.

88
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,170
<3-12,Sheldon>告诉我
<3-12,Sheldon>Yeah, tell me,

89
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,750
<3-12,Sheldon>那个店员选了4K显示屏
<3-12,Sheldon>did the guy choose one with a 4K display

90
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,110
<3-12,Sheldon>还带有雷电接口的吗
<3-12,Sheldon>and a Thunderbolt port?

91
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,890
<3-13,Amy>-是的  -是吗
<3-13,Amy>- Yes. - Yeah?

92
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,550
<3-14,Sheldon>那这个店员有没有
<3-14,Sheldon>D-Did the guy make sure

93
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,060
<3-14,Sheldon>确保这台是有1TB固态硬盘的呢
<3-14,Sheldon>that this has a one-terabyte solid-state drive?

94
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,130
<3-15,Amy>-是的  -是吗
<3-15,Amy>- Yes. - Yeah?

95
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,160
<3-16,Sheldon>他是不是就是科罗拉多电脑店的里克呢
<3-16,Sheldon>Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?

96
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,840
<3-13,Amy>是的
<3-13,Amy>Yes.

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,950
<3-18,Sheldon>好吧  他的确是很懂行
<3-18,Sheldon>Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.

98
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,280
<4-1,Leonard>把主体用反光带包起来之后
<4-1,Leonard>After you wrap the body in reflective tape,

99
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,770
<4-1,Leonard>末端用铁氟龙胶带缠住  这样封口才会紧密
<4-1,Leonard>the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.

100
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,270
<4-3,Leonard>-这样吗  -完美
<4-3,Leonard>- Like this? - Yeah, perfect.

101
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,290
<4-5,Leonard>手指小巧灵活的人干这个比较有优势
<4-5,Leonard>And it helps to have small, delicate fingers.

102
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,720
<4-5,Leonard>所以你要是没有我跟霍华德快
<4-5,Leonard>So don't be discouraged if you can't do it as fast

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,440
<4-5,Leonard>不要太气馁哦
<4-5,Leonard>as me and Howard.

104
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,100
<4-6,Howard>我们好像没有足够焊料
<4-6,Howard>I don't know if we have enough solder

105
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,770
<4-6,Howard>来焊住这些电路板
<4-6,Howard>to finish these circuit boards.

106
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,800
<4-7,Leonard>昨天不好有剩一整个焊料线轴吗
<4-7,Leonard>We had a full spool yesterday.

107
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,730
<4-8,Howard>我能说啥
<4-8,Howard>What can I say,

108
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,200
<4-8,Howard>小爷性子野  焊接时更野
<4-8,Howard>I play hard, I solder even harder.

109
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,700
<4-9,Bernadette>有时候他在家光膀子焊接东西
<4-9,Bernadette>Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off.

110
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,100
<4-9,Bernadette>简直像啤酒广告般狂野
<4-9,Bernadette>It's like a beer commercial.

111
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,720
<4-10,Leonard>我们得跑一趟五金店了
<4-10,Leonard>Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.

112
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,470
<4-11,Penny>你怎么好意思自称科学家  结果没焊料
<4-11,Penny>How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?

113
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,310
<4-12,Leonard>这事说起来好笑
<4-12,Leonard>Well, funny story.

114
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,550
<4-12,Leonard>我们有很多60/40比例的锡铅焊料
<4-12,Leonard>So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder,

115
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,950
<4-12,Leonard>但那个线轴看起来跟63/37的很像...
<4-12,Leonard>but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to...

116
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,350
<4-13,Penny>宝贝  宝贝  你先停停
<4-13,Penny>Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you.

117
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,970
<4-13,Penny>这不是什么好笑的事
<4-13,Penny>That is-is not a funny story.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,110
<4-14,Howard>你想跟我们一起来吗
<4-14,Howard>You want to come with us?

119
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,560
<4-15,Bernadette>我正开始进入节奏呢
<4-15,Bernadette>I'm kind of getting into the groove here.

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,570
<4-16,Penny>你们去店里买东西
<4-16,Penny>Yeah, you guys run to the store

121
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,050
<4-16,Penny>然后换女人来掌握科学吧
<4-16,Penny>and let the women handle the science for a change.

122
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,750
<4-16,Penny>行
<4-16,Penny>Okay.

123
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,140
<4-17,Leonard>我们会尽快回来
<4-17,Leonard>We'll be back as soon as we can.

124
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,050
<4-18,Penny>所以  什么...
<4-18,Penny>Okay, so what...

125
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,030
<4-18,Penny>是焊料
<4-18,Penny>is solder?

126
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,340
<5-1,Sheldon>我想我该先设置电脑
<5-1,Sheldon>I suppose I should set this up.

127
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,300
<5-1,Sheldon>还是你要把这份乐趣也剥夺掉啊
<5-1,Sheldon>Or would you like to rob me of that, too?

128
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,820
<5-2,Amy>不许闹了  否则我要开始把有W的单词
<5-2,Amy>Knock it off or I'll start making W-H sounds

129
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,490
<5-2,Amy>都念出WH的音
<5-2,Amy>for words that just have a W.

130

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,630
<5-5,Sheldon>但我相信  假以时日我会喜欢上...
<5-5,Sheldon>But I'm sure, in time, that this one will...

<5-7,Sheldon>瞧瞧这4K的分辨率
<5-7,Sheldon>Look at the 4K resolution.

141

<5-7,Sheldon>下次我们视频的时候  我要数数
<5-7,Sheldon>Next time we Skype, I'm gonna count

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,320
<5-7,Sheldon>你到底有几根鼻毛
<5-7,Sheldon>all those nostril hairs.

143
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,740
<5-8,Amy>或者你可以凝视我的双眼啊
<5-8,Amy>Or you could just look into my eyes.

144
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,470
<5-9,Sheldon>但你只有两只眼睛啊
<5-9,Sheldon>But you only have two eyes.

145
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,400
<5-9,Sheldon>但鼻毛却有好多好多
<5-9,Sheldon>You got a lot of nostril hairs.

146
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,780
<5-10,Amy>算了  你开心就好
<5-10,Amy>Well, you know, as long as you're happy.

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,110
<5-11,Sheldon>超开心的
<5-11,Sheldon>I am.

148
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,060
<5-12,Amy>里克说你可以把旧电脑拿过去回收
<5-12,Amy>And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.

149
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,730
<5-13,Sheldon>不了  多谢提醒
<5-13,Sheldon>Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.

150
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,290
<5-14,Amy>但他说回收可以换积分
<5-14,Amy>Oh, but he said you can get store credit.

151
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,910
<5-15,Sheldon>不用  我不想送去回收
<5-15,Sheldon>Well, no, I just... I-I don't want to recycle it.

152
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,810
<5-15,Sheldon>我也不想要积分
<5-15,Sheldon>And I don't want store credit.

153
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,530
<5-16,Amy>但你为什么不...
<5-16,Amy>But why wouldn't...

154
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,650
<5-17,Sheldon>我们能换个话题吗
<5-17,Sheldon>Can we please change the subject?

155
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,190
<5-17,Sheldon>好吧
<5-17,Sheldon>O-Okay.

156
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,320
<5-18,Amy>不如我们来谈谈  你态度为什么变这么奇怪
<5-18,Amy>How 'bout we change it to why you're being weird about this?

157
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,920
<5-19,Sheldon>我的态度才不奇怪
<5-19,Sheldon>I'm not being weird.

158
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,030
<5-19,Sheldon>只是很难解释清楚
<5-19,Sheldon>It's hard to explain.

159
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,730
<5-20,Amy>谢尔顿  实话实话就好啦
<5-20,Amy>Sheldon, just tell me.

160
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,010
<5-21,Sheldon>可能带你去看更直观
<5-21,Sheldon>It might be easier to show you.

161
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,960
<5-22,Amy>好吧
<5-22,Amy>Okay.

162
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,470
<5-23,Sheldon>我们得坐你的车去
<5-23,Sheldon>We'd have to take your car.

163
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,250
<5-24,Amy>行
<5-24,Amy>All right.

164
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,590
<5-25,Sheldon>你还得签一份保密协议
<5-25,Sheldon>And I'm gonna need you to sign a nondisclosure agreement.

165
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,570
<5-26,Amy>我们滚床单前  我也签过一份
<5-26,Amy>Well, I signed one before we slept together.

166
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,210
<5-26,Amy>现在再签一份有何不可
<5-26,Amy>Why not now?

167
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,710
<6-1,Leonard>佩妮说她们觉得倒腾原型挺有趣的
<6-1,Leonard>Penny says they're having fun working on the prototype.

168
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,000
<6-2,Howard>还记得以前她觉得有趣的是
<6-2,Howard>Remember when her fun was

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,510
<6-2,Howard>夜店和喝酒游戏吗
<6-2,Howard>nightclubs and drinking games?

170
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,890
<6-3,Leonard>记得  我用超慢速降低她标准
<6-3,Leonard>I know. I'm lowering the bar so slowly.

171
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,040
<6-3,Leonard>明年的这个时候  她会觉得收藏硬币很有趣
<6-3,Leonard>This time next year she'll have a coin collection.

<6-7,Man>Oh, I can't tell you. But it does star Will Smith.

177
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,950
<6-7,Man>慢着
<6-7,Man>Wait.

178
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,820
<6-8,Howard>我敢说一定是《X特遣队》
<6-8,Howard>I bet it's Suicide Squad.

180
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,230
<6-8,Howard>我们去看吧
<6-8,Howard>Let's check it out.

<6-10,Howard>佩妮不是说她们挺开心的吗
<6-10,Howard>Penny just said they're having fun.

183
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,200
<6-10,Howard>讲真  你想一下午都耗在
<6-10,Howard>Honestly, you want to wrap tape around

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,880
<6-10,Howard>用胶带缠接管件上吗
<6-10,Howard>a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?

185
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,850
<6-11,Leonard>好吧  那就看吧
<6-11,Leonard>Okay, we'll take 'em.

<6-11,Leonard>Okay.

187
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,600
<6-11,Leonard>但我发誓
<6-11,Leonard>But, I swear,

188
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,210
<6-11,Leonard>如果是威尔·史密斯主演的《鲨鱼黑帮2》
<6-11,Leonard>if it's Will Smith in Shark Tale 2,

189
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,950
<6-11,Leonard>2004年由威尔·史密斯配音的动画电影
<6-11,Leonard>风评并不佳

190
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,950
<6-11,Leonard>那它最好不要比第一部还烂
<6-11,Leonard>it better be at least as good as the original.

191
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,740
<6-11,Leonard>真是难以置信
<6-11,Leonard>I mean, it's crazy, isn't it?

192
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
<7-1,Penny>我从家乡搬来这里是为了当女演员
<7-1,Penny>I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress,

193
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,960
<7-1,Penny>而我现在坐在加州理工的工程实验室

<7-1,Penny>helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.

195
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,090
<7-2,Bernadette>的确难以置信
<7-2,Bernadette>It is crazy.

196
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,250
<7-2,Bernadette>更让人难以置信的是  我已经弄好14个了
<7-2,Bernadette>It's also crazy that I've made 14 of these

197
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,740
<7-2,Bernadette>你才弄好3个
<7-2,Bernadette>and you've made three.

198
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,780
<7-3,Raj>你们老公都去哪儿了
<7-3,Raj>Hey. Where are the guys?

<7-4,Penny>Oh, they went to the store to get solder,

200
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,160
<7-4,Penny>就是那种能用火熔化做科学东西的金属
<7-4,Penny>which is metal you melt to make science things.

201
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,530
<7-5,Bernadette>话说你怎么周末也上班啊
<7-5,Bernadette>Since when do you work on weekends?

00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,970
<7-6,Raj>我是一位天体物理学家
<7-6,Raj>I'm an astrophysicist.

203

<7-6,Raj>星星可是365天全年无休哟
<7-6,Raj>The stars don't take a day off.

204
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,880
<7-7,Penny>你是在家寂寞  没人跟你玩吧
<7-7,Penny>You were home alone and had no one to play with?

205

<7-8,Raj>清洁女工在  但她不喜欢我
<7-8,Raj>Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn't like me.

<7-10,Penny>我们来就行
<7-10,Penny>I think we're good.

<7-11,Raj>好吧  那就好
<7-11,Raj>Okay. That's cool.

210
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,190
<7-11,Raj>人人都有份参与  唯独我除外
<7-11,Raj>I guess everybody's involved in this project but me.

211
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,160
<7-11,Raj>那我走啦
<7-11,Raj>So... see ya.

212
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,260
<7-12,Bernadette>我觉得好内疚
<7-12,Bernadette>I feel bad.

213
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,010
<7-12,Bernadette>我们要让他留下来吗
<7-12,Bernadette>Should we have asked him to stay?

<8-6,Sheldon>我是叫你往"右"拐  结果你开过了
<8-6,Sheldon>No, I meant turn right, and you missed it.

222
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,960
<8-6,Sheldon>也许你真的需要知道
<8-6,Sheldon>Maybe you do need to know.

223
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,430
<9-1,Leonard>我们要怎么对自己老婆说呢
<9-1,Leonard>What are we gonna tell the girls?

224
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,420
<9-2,Howard>这都不是事儿
<9-2,Howard>It's not a problem.

225
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,590
<9-3,Leonard>我是说不撒谎的话
<9-3,Leonard>I mean without lying.

226
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,960
<9-4,Howard>现在你把这变成大事了
<9-4,Howard>And now you've made it a problem.

<9-5,Leonard>拜托  咱俩可是智商超群的人
<9-5,Leonard>Come on. We're a couple of smart guys.

228
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,590
<9-5,Leonard>一定能想出一个既不破坏我们形象
<9-5,Leonard>I'm sure we can come up with a way to explain this

229
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,850
<9-5,Leonard>又能合理解释的办法
<9-5,Leonard>that doesn't make us look bad.

230
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,760
<9-6,Penny (at Howard’s workshop, reading text)>他们俩为了焊料一路开到圣贝纳迪诺
<9-6,Penny (at Howard’s workshop, reading text)>The boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino

231
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,400
<9-6,Penny (at Howard’s workshop, reading text)>结果在路上爆胎了
<9-6,Penny (at Howard’s workshop, reading text)>for the solder and got a flat.

232
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,140

<9-7,Leonard>They bought it.

233
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,380
<9-8,Howard>不过我们必须得在回家前把备胎换上
<9-8,Howard>But we're gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.

234
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,090
<9-9,Leonard>你还真在行啊
<9-9,Leonard>Oh, you're good at this.

235

264
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,770

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,940
<10-11,Amy>我需要一分钟来好好消化一下
<10-11,Amy>So I'm gonna need a minute.

286
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,630
<11-1,Penny>等他们回来我们该作何反应呢
<11-1,Penny>All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?

287
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,020
<11-1,Penny>我知道
<11-1,Penny>I know.

288
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,410
<11-2,Raj>你们俩应该跟我疯狂亲热
<11-2,Raj>You guys should totally be making out with me.

289
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,420
<11-3,Penny>亲爱的  我知道你觉得这种玩笑很好笑
<11-3,Penny>Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny,

290
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,130
<11-3,Penny>但你觉得自己真的有能力
<11-3,Penny>but do you really think you could handle

291
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,800
<11-3,Penny>能驾驭得住我俩吗
<11-3,Penny>making out with both of us?

292
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,400
<11-3,Penny>不  女王
<11-3,Penny>No, ma'am.

293
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,910
<11-4,Raj>好了好了  这个如何
<11-4,Raj>Okay. Okay, how about this?

294
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,140
<11-4,Raj>他们不知道你和我们在一起
<11-4,Raj>They don't know you're here with us,

295
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,260
<11-5,Bernadette>所以你就藏在这个柜子里
<11-5,Bernadette>so you hide in the closet.

296
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,100
<11-5,Bernadette>等他们回来
<11-5,Bernadette>When they show up,

297
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,320
<11-5,Bernadette>我们先听听他们编造出来的鬼故事
<11-5,Bernadette>we'll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were,

298
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,700
<11-5,Bernadette>假装相信他们
<11-5,Bernadette>we'll pretend to believe them,

299
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,340
<11-5,Bernadette>等他们以为自己成功骗过去的时候
<11-5,Bernadette>and just when they think they got away with it,

300
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,270
<11-5,Bernadette>你就跳出来
<11-5,Bernadette>you jump out.

301
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,290
<11-6,Penny>这个主意不错
<11-6,Penny>Yeah, that's pretty good.

302
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,470
<11-7,Raj>我太喜欢了
<11-7,Raj>I love it!

303
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,400
<11-7,Raj>我会大叫  "抓到啦"
<11-7,Raj>I'll be all like, "Busted!"

304
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,990
<11-7,Raj>他们会说  "什么鬼"
<11-7,Raj>And they'll be like, "What?!"

305
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,890
<11-7,Raj>我们就一起说  "就是酱"
<11-7,Raj>And then we'll all be like, "Oh, yeah!"

306
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,640
<11-7,Raj>好好  我明白了
<11-7,Raj>Yeah, I-I get it.

307
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,400
<11-7,Raj>连我自己都不愿和我这种人亲热
<11-7,Raj>I wouldn't make out with me, either.

308
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,210
<12-1,Sheldon>这里有我拥有过的每一个收音机闹钟
<12-1,Sheldon>In here is every clock radio I've ever owned.

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,050
<12-2,Amy>你还有运动器材啊
<12-2,Amy>Y-You have sporting equipment?

312

<12-3,Sheldon>Well, oh, it's just a... it's a... A golf ball

313
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,600
<12-3,Sheldon>我哥哥拿来砸我的头的
<12-3,Sheldon>that my brother threw at my head.

314
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,500
<12-3,Sheldon>砸下的坑现在还在呢
<12-3,Sheldon>You can still feel the dent.

315
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,620
<12-3,Sheldon>就在冰球留下的坑旁边
<12-3,Sheldon>It's right next to the hockey puck dent.

316
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,870
<12-4,Amy>你怎么还有一整盒的松果啊
<12-4,Amy>Okay, why do you have a bin of pinecones?

317
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,020
<12-5,Sheldon>这是我小时候收集的
<12-5,Sheldon>I used to collect them as a child.

318
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,800
<12-5,Sheldon>松果的鳞片螺旋的比例
<12-5,Sheldon>The spiral of scales open in

319
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,700
<12-5,Sheldon>按斐波那契列数排列
<12-5,Sheldon>the Fibonacci sequence.

320
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,550
<12-5,Sheldon>可当你把这事告诉你哥哥时
<12-5,Sheldon>A fact that, when you tell your brother,

321
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,420
<12-5,Sheldon>他会拿高尔夫球砸你脑袋
<12-5,Sheldon>gets a golf ball thrown at your head.

322
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,650
<12-6,Amy>那你为什么觉得有必要留下这些东西呢
<12-6,Amy>So, why do you feel you need to save these things?

323
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,090
<12-7,Sheldon>说好听点  这叫怀旧
<12-7,Sheldon>I'd like to say it's nostalgia,

324
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,990
<12-7,Sheldon>可实际是  每次我想扔掉某物时
<12-7,Sheldon>but every time I think of throwing anything away,

325
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,840
<12-7,Sheldon>我就会开始耳鸣
<12-7,Sheldon>my ears start to ring,

326
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,870
<12-7,Sheldon>内心忐忑得像有蝴蝶在我胃里乱飞
<12-7,Sheldon>and I get butterflies in my stomach.

327
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,940
<12-7,Sheldon>飞着飞着
<12-7,Sheldon>And then it feels like

328
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,570
<12-7,Sheldon>老鼠来了  蝴蝶被吃掉了
<12-7,Sheldon>the butterflies get eaten by rats,

329
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,080
<12-7,Sheldon>接下来  老鼠又被吃掉了...
<12-7,Sheldon>and then, the-the rats get eaten by...

330
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,310
<12-8,Amy>行了  我懂了  懂了
<12-8,Amy>Okay. I get it. I get it.

331
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,300
<12-9,Sheldon>最后来收尾的是恐龙
<12-9,Sheldon>It ends with dinosaurs.

332
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,010
<12-9,Sheldon>如果让你觉得瞧不起我  我很遗憾
<12-9,Sheldon>I'm sorry if you think less of me.

333
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,900
<12-10,Amy>我没有
<12-10,Amy>I don't.

334
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,480
<12-10,Amy>真的吗
<12-10,Amy>Really?

335
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,510
<12-11,Sheldon>因为我每次来这里
<12-11,Sheldon>'Cause every time I come in here,

336
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,530
<12-11,Sheldon>都会瞧不起自己
<12-11,Sheldon>I think less of me.

337
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,860
<12-12,Amy>为什么
<12-12,Amy>Why?

338
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,090
<12-13,Sheldon>因为我是个骗子
<12-13,Sheldon>Because I'm a fraud.

339
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,870
<12-13,Sheldon>我嘴上说自己意志强大
<12-13,Sheldon>No. I purport to be a man of the mind.

340
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,330
<12-13,Sheldon>还总念叨着会有科技大突破
<12-13,Sheldon>I've been such a-a vocal champion of the singularity,

341
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,520
<12-13,Sheldon>可一个要舍弃自己的身体
<12-13,Sheldon>but how can I leave my body behind

342
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,240
<12-13,Sheldon>成为网络一部分的我本人
<12-13,Sheldon>and become one with the Internet

343
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,390
<12-13,Sheldon>怎么能连一根牙刷都舍不得扔
<12-13,Sheldon>when I've never even thrown a toothbrush away?

344
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,610
<12-14,Amy>没关系  谢尔顿
<12-14,Amy>It's okay, Sheldon.

345
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,440
<12-14,Amy>我也有很多奇怪的东西不舍得扔掉
<12-14,Amy>You know, I... I've saved a lot of weird things, too.

346
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,050
<12-15,Sheldon>比如什么
<12-15,Sheldon>Like what?

347
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,470
<12-16,Amy>你知道我有一片显微镜玻片
<12-16,Amy>Did you know I have a microscope slide

348
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,790
<12-16,Amy>上面有一点点小组织
<12-16,Amy>with a little bit of tissue

349
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,200
<12-16,Amy>来自我第一个解剖的大脑
<12-16,Amy>from the first brain I ever dissected?

350
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,170
<12-17,Sheldon>我有一个旧泰迪熊
<12-17,Sheldon>I have an old teddy bear

351
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,330
<12-17,Sheldon>我偷偷用它擦了好多年鼻子
<12-17,Sheldon>I secretly wiped my nose on for years.

352
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,360
<12-18,Amy>这不是比赛
<12-18,Amy>It's not a contest.

<13-3,Raj>好  我听出哪里有歧义了  闭嘴
<13-3,Raj>Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.

358
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,070
<13-6,Penny>这是怎么回事

<13-7,Leonard>听我说  我们干了件蠢事
<13-7,Leonard>Listen, we did a stupid thing.

360
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,800
<13-8,Howard>我们跑去看了场电影  还撒了谎
<13-8,Howard>We went to a movie and lied about it,

361
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,020
<13-8,Howard>但我们知道错了
<13-8,Howard>but we feel bad

362
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,360
<13-8,Howard>想补偿你们
<13-8,Howard>and want to make it up to you.

363
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,600
<13-9,Leonard>这花送给你们  你们要是不那么生气
<13-9,Leonard>So, these are for you, and if you're not too mad,

00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,900
<13-12,Penny>但我们做原型的确做得挺开心的
<13-12,Penny>but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,860
<13-18,Raj>这结局略显平淡啊
<13-18,Raj>Well this is kind of anti-climactic.

00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,300
<13-19,Howard>你知道什么结局不平淡吗
<13-19,Howard>You know what wasn't anti-climactic?

<14-2,Sheldon>只有你

<14-4,Sheldon>What good is having a girlfriend

387
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,130
<14-4,Sheldon>可以把自己的心理垃圾扔给她啊
<14-4,Sheldon>if you can't unload your psychological sewage on her?

388
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,440
<14-5,Amy>没错  我就是你的情绪茅坑
<14-5,Amy>That's me, your emotional outhouse.

<14-6,Sheldon>I wouldn't even know how to begin.

394
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,850
<14-7,Amy>一点点来吧
<14-7,Amy>Baby steps, I guess.

395
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,800
<14-8,Sheldon>我可以先试着把这高尔夫球扔掉
<14-8,Sheldon>I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.

396
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,150
<14-9,Amy>好呀

<15-3,Sheldon>距离我上床睡觉的时间  还有几个小时呢
<15-3,Sheldon>it's still a couple of hours until my bedtime.

409
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,740
<15-4,Amy>你有什么想法吗

<16-2,Amy (on Skype)>有必要为了这事赶我回家吗
<16-2,Amy (on Skype)>I really had to go home for this?

<16-4,Amy>And yet, I'm not.

415
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,970
<16-5,Sheldon>感觉我一伸手就能碰到你
<16-5,Sheldon>But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.

416
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,740
<16-6,Amy>可是你并不能
<16-6,Amy>And yet, you can't.
