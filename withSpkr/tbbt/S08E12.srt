1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,640
<1-1,Sheldon>你想当哪个颜色
<1-1,Sheldon>What color would you like to be?

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,270
<1-2,Leonard>我想要绿色啊  可是每次都被你抢了
<1-2,Leonard>Well, I'd like to be green, but you know you always take it.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,680
<1-3,Sheldon>没有好吗
<1-3,Sheldon>That's not true.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,410
<1-3,Sheldon>我哪个颜色都行
<1-3,Sheldon>Any color's fine with me.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,820
<1-3,Sheldon>给我蓝色和黄色的结合色也行啊
<1-3,Sheldon>Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,700
<1-4,Leonard>蓝加黄不就是绿色吗
<1-4,Leonard>Blue and yellow make green.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,580
<1-5,Sheldon>就这么愉快地决定了
<1-5,Sheldon>Well, then it's settled.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,670
<1-6,Penny>准备好出发了吗
<1-6,Penny>Hi. Ready to go?

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,520
<1-7,Sheldon>好消息  我们叫了午餐外送
<1-7,Sheldon>Oh, good news, we ordered lunch,

<1-7,Sheldon>我们可以一起在家玩《战国风云:魔戒》
<1-7,Sheldon>so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,330
<1-7,Sheldon>战国风云是一种战旗类桌游  玩家用兵占领领地
<1-7,Sheldon>再互相攻击直到征服全世界

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,160
<1-8,Amy>谢尔顿  我们说好了是今晚陪你玩
<1-8,Amy>Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,630
<1-9,Sheldon>没错啊  今晚我们还会继续玩
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, no, we'll still be playing it tonight--

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,170
<1-9,Sheldon>这游戏花个八小时也是家常便饭
<1-9,Sheldon>this game can easily take eight hours.

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,080
<1-10,Penny>亲爱的  你真的觉得我想留下玩这个吗
<1-10,Penny>Sweetie, you really thought I'd want to do this?

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,460
<1-12,Penny>-没有啊  -那你跟他说了吗
<1-12,Penny>- No. - Well, did you tell him that?

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,920
<1-13,Leonard>-有啊  -你有大声开口说出吗
<1-13,Leonard>- Yes. - Did you say it out loud with words?

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,880
<1-14,Penny>没有
<1-14,Penny>No.

19
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,540
<1-16,Penny>我不想要一整天都留在家里玩桌游
<1-16,Penny>I don't want to spend the whole day playing a board game.

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,380
<1-17,Sheldon>你听完可能就会改变主意
<1-17,Sheldon>Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear

00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,800
<1-17,Sheldon>这可是全新扩充包

<1-18,Amy>I will literally race you to the car.

25
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,690
<1-19,Leonard>别别别  别一走了之  试试再说嘛
<1-19,Leonard>No, no, no, come on, don't leave. Just try it.

26
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,420
<1-20,Penny>不要  我们总是在做你们男生想做的事
<1-20,Penny>No. We're always doing what you guys want.

27
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,230
<1-20,Penny>哪怕就一次  换你们做我们想要的事该多好
<1-20,Penny>Just once, it'd be nice if you did something we wanted.

28
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,410
<1-21,Sheldon>你想当绿色吗
<1-21,Sheldon>You want to be green?

29
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,800
<1-22,Leonard>她们的确是有试着
<1-22,Leonard>You know, they really have tried to

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,630
<1-22,Leonard>喜欢上我们迷的那些事物
<1-22,Leonard>like a lot of the same stuff we're into.

31
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,980
<1-23,Penny>我们参加了游戏之夜  游戏机之夜
<1-23,Penny>Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights

32
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,090
<1-23,Penny>跟你们一起看导演评论版的电影
<1-23,Penny>and we watch movies with director's commentary.

33
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,930
<2-1,Raj>我最爱的
<2-1,Raj>Oh, my favorite--

34
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,080
<1-24,Amy>是乔治·卢卡斯可以整部《星球大战》说个不停
<1-24,Amy>George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars,

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,170
<1-24,Amy>我就说一个字  就被流放到了厨房
<1-24,Amy>I say one word and I'm banished to the kitchen.

36
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,650
<1-25,Penny>今天由我跟艾米来决定我们做什么
<1-25,Penny>Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we're all gonna do.

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,600
<1-26,Leonard>行啊  你们女生做决定
<1-26,Leonard>You got it, you girls are in charge.

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,730
<1-27,Penny>-谢谢  -谢尔顿呢
<1-27,Penny>- Thank you. - Sheldon?

39
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,750
<1-28,Amy>好吧
<1-28,Amy>Fine.

40
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,490
<1-29,Sheldon>现在我们不玩了  绿色给你当吧
<1-29,Sheldon>Now that we're not playing, you can be green.

41
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,910
<1-31,Sheldon>-谢主隆恩  -这次你是绿色
<1-31,Sheldon>- Thank you. - And since you're green this time,

42
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,040
<1-31,Sheldon>那下次就换我了
<1-31,Sheldon>I can be it next time.

43
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,790
<1-32,Penny>好了  来想想  有什么好玩的事
<1-32,Penny>All right, let's see. What's something fun

44
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,690
<1-32,Penny>是他们永远不会带我们去做的
<1-32,Penny>the guys would never take us to do?

45
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,510
<1-32,Penny>我知道了  我们可以去骑马
<1-32,Penny>Oh, I know-- we could go horseback riding.

46
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,800
<1-32,Penny>我骑不了
<1-32,Penny>I actually can't.

47
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,620
<1-33,Amy>我的臀部不能打开超过22度
<1-33,Amy>My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees.

48
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,070
<1-33,Amy>我试过骑一只非常瘦的马
<1-33,Amy>I rode a very thin pony once.

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,520
<1-33,Amy>才颠一下  臀部就脱臼了
<1-33,Amy>On the first bump... just popped right off.

50
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,120
<1-34,Penny>好吧  那你想做什么
<1-34,Penny>All right, well, what do you want to do?

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,730
<1-35,Amy>威尔希尔那边有一个手工艺与民间艺术馆
<1-35,Amy>There's a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.

52
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,990
<1-35,Amy>那是威尔希尔那边的人倒霉
<1-35,Amy>Well, that's Wilshire's problem.

53
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,320
<1-36,Penny>再想想嘛  肯定有什么好玩的事情
<1-36,Penny>Come on, you know, there-there's got to be something fun

54
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,970
<1-36,Penny>是我们想做他们讨厌的
<1-36,Penny>we could do that the guys will hate.

55
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,820
<1-37,Leonard>等等  为什么非得是我们讨厌的事
<1-37,Leonard>Hang on, why do we have to hate it?

56
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,240
<1-38,Penny>送你几个字  神秘博士大会
<1-38,Penny>Three words: Doctor Who convention.

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,010
<1-39,Leonard>当时我又没逼你跟着去
<1-39,Leonard>I-I did not force you to go to that.

58
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,160
<1-40,Penny>你戴着神秘博士的圆顶小帽  还别上领结出门
<1-40,Penny>You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie.

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,890
<1-40,Penny>我怕你被揍才跟着去
<1-40,Penny>I went so you didn't get beat up.

60
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,770
<1-41,Leonard>我才不会被揍呢
<1-41,Leonard>I wasn't gonna get beat up.

61
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,760
<1-42,Penny>你差点被揍啊  是我后来突然忍住了
<1-42,Penny>You were, but somehow I held myself back.

62
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,710
<1-43,Sheldon>你知道你们可以逼我们干嘛吗  溜冰刀
<1-43,Sheldon>You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating.

63
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,930
<1-43,Sheldon>冷空气会让莱纳德犯气喘
<1-43,Sheldon>The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma

64
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,890
<1-43,Sheldon>而且这正中我长久以来
<1-43,Sheldon>and it plays right into my well-known fear of

65
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,960
<1-43,Sheldon>害怕被磨冰场车压扁的恐惧
<1-43,Sheldon>getting flattened by a Zamboni.

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,310
<1-44,Leonard>你在帮忙他们想能让我们痛苦不堪的事吗
<1-44,Leonard>Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?

67
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,200
<1-45,Sheldon>抱歉  莱纳德
<1-45,Sheldon>Well, I'm sorry, Leonard,

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,140
<1-45,Sheldon>我专治各种疑难杂症  这是我强项
<1-45,Sheldon>I'm a problem-solver, it's what I do.

69
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,240
<1-46,Amy>我其实也不能溜冰刀
<1-46,Amy>I actually can't go ice-skating.

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,720
<1-46,Amy>我有非比寻常易碎的膝盖
<1-46,Amy>I have unnaturally brittle ankles.

71
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,760
<1-47,Penny>你身上有任何一个部位是正常的吗
<1-47,Penny>Is there any part of your body that's normal?

78
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,200
<2-1,Raj>我的天啊  天啊  天啊
<2-1,Raj>Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,780
<2-2,Howard>-你能放轻松点吗  -我承受不了了  兄弟
<2-2,Howard>- Will you please relax? - I can't take it, dude.

80
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,400
<2-4,Bernadette>-你没事吧  -我有事
<2-4,Bernadette>- You okay? - No, I'm not okay.

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,830
<2-5,Raj>我感觉我灵魂快冲出我的皮肤了
<2-5,Raj>I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my skin.

82
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,820
<2-6,Bernadette>我就告诉你别蜜蜡除毛"那里"
<2-6,Bernadette>I told you not to wax down there.

83
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,550
<2-6,Bernadette>重新长出来的时候会痒
<2-6,Bernadette>It's itchy when it grows back.

84
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,210
<2-7,Raj>我在担心"新视野号太空探测器"
<2-7,Raj>I'm worried about the New Horizons space probe.

85
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,390
<2-7,Raj>于2006年发射  价值7亿美元  约钢琴般大小
<2-7,Raj>在14年底从休眠中苏醒  正准备对冥王星进行探测

86
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,390
<2-8,Bernadette>他在说什么
<2-8,Bernadette>What's he talking about?

87
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,820
<2-9,Howard>九年前他曾在一个团队里
<2-9,Howard>Nine years ago he was part of a team

88
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,630
<2-9,Howard>他们发射了探测器去搜集冥王星的资料
<2-9,Howard>that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto.

89
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,120
<2-9,Howard>现在终于飞到够近了
<2-9,Howard>It's finally close enough,

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,190
<2-9,Howard>所以今早它自行苏醒了
<2-9,Howard>so this morning it turned itself on.

91
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,090
<2-10,Raj>是希望它会
<2-10,Raj>We hope.

92
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,520
<2-10,Raj>信号得穿越三十亿英里回来
<2-10,Raj>The signal has to travel over three billion miles.

93
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,430
<2-10,Raj>所以得过好几小时才知道它有没有成功到达
<2-10,Raj>So it's gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.

94
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,800
<2-11,Howard>所以他这副样子  就是因为他在担心
<2-11,Howard>Now we get to see him flip out because he's worried

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,420
<2-11,Howard>飞船在途中被太空冰给撞毁
<2-11,Howard>it was demolished by space ice.

96
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,670
<2-12,Raj>太空冰不是闹着玩的好吗
<2-12,Raj>Space ice is no joke.

97
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,240
<2-12,Raj>我现在都不敢看《冰雪奇缘》了
<2-12,Raj>I can't even watch Frozen anymore.

98
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,770
<3-1,Amy>费城爱乐在市中心演奏[玩]贝多芬呢
<3-1,Amy>Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.

99
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,760
<3-2,Sheldon>在你答应之前
<3-2,Sheldon>Yeah, well, before you say yes,

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,510
<3-2,Sheldon>1992年电影《我家也有贝多芬》
<3-2,Sheldon>主角狗狗就叫贝多芬

101
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,610
<3-2,Sheldon>她说的不是电影里的那条大狗哦
<3-2,Sheldon>it's not the movie about the big dog.

102
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,540
<3-3,Penny>为什么我们想不出我们俩都想做的事呢
<3-3,Penny>How come we can't think of something we both want to do?

103
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,490
<3-4,Amy>因为每次都是你选我们做什么
<3-4,Amy>Because you always pick what we do

104
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,250
<3-4,Amy>我只是跟着你
<3-4,Amy>and I just go along with it.

105
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,630
<3-5,Leonard>有趣
<3-5,Leonard>Ah, interesting--

106
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,860
<3-5,Leonard>我们被你指控整天逼你们做不喜欢的事
<3-5,Leonard>we're being accused of making you do things you don't like,

107
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,520
<3-5,Leonard>结果一看  你对可怜的艾米也是这样
<3-5,Leonard>and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.

108
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,620
<3-6,Sheldon>你应该指出她的行为有多伪君子
<3-6,Sheldon>You should point out the hypocrisy of that.

109
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,500
<3-7,Leonard>我刚才就是在说这个啊
<3-7,Leonard>That's what I was doing.

110
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,290
<3-8,Sheldon>你说得不够清楚
<3-8,Sheldon>Oh, that wasn't clear.

111
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,740
<3-8,Sheldon>再试一次  这一次单刀直入
<3-8,Sheldon>Try it again, but this time drive it home

112
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,760
<3-8,Sheldon>并送上"自食其果了吧  小妞"
<3-8,Sheldon>with, "How do you like them apples, missy?"

113
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,330
<3-9,Penny>好吧  继续想
<3-9,Penny>All right, keep thinking.

114
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,300
<3-10,Sheldon>你干嘛把事情搞这么复杂
<3-10,Sheldon>You're making it too complicated.

115
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,800
<3-10,Sheldon>何不来点基本款折磨
<3-10,Sheldon>Why not stick to the basics?

116
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
<3-10,Sheldon>你们去逛街
<3-10,Sheldon>Go shopping for clothes

117
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,230
<3-10,Sheldon>我和莱纳德就坐在店里不舒服的椅子上
<3-10,Sheldon>while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs

118
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,800
<3-10,Sheldon>帮你们看着包包
<3-10,Sheldon>and hold your purses, hmm?

119
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,430
<3-10,Sheldon>反正我是讨厌这样
<3-10,Sheldon>I know I'd hate that.

120
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,640
<3-10,Sheldon>莱纳德  你呢
<3-10,Sheldon>Leonard?

121
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,210
<3-11,Leonard>当然
<3-11,Leonard>Well, yeah.

122
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,780
<3-12,Sheldon>那就愉快地决定啦
<3-12,Sheldon>Well, then, it's settled?

123
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,930
<3-13,Amy>你觉得怎么样  听起来是个好主意
<3-13,Amy>What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.

124
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,000
<3-14,Penny>的确  但被他这么一说  感觉乐趣都没了
<3-14,Penny>It does-- somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,370
<3-15,Sheldon>再次证明  这是我强项
<3-15,Sheldon>Well, once again, it's what I do.

126
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,700
<4-1,Raj>还要继续等两小时
<4-1,Raj>Oh, another two hours to go.

127
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,360
<4-1,Raj>这过程真是等死我了
<4-1,Raj>The wait is killing me.

128
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,530
<4-2,Howard>我懂这种感觉
<4-2,Howard>I know. I get it.

129
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,520
<4-2,Howard>当我坐着联盟号太空舱从空间站
<4-2,Howard>When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station,

130
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,640
<4-2,Howard>以每小时1万7千英里的速度返回地球时...
<4-2,Howard>plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour...

131
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,540
<4-3,Raj>在你说完前
<4-3,Raj>Before you finish,

132
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,490
<4-3,Raj>我想问这故事是关于耐心和等待
<4-3,Raj>is this a story about patience and waiting

133
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,300
<4-3,Raj>还是只是为了提醒我你上过太空
<4-3,Raj>or just another reminder that you went to space?

134
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,840
<4-4,Howard>两个愿望一次满足嘛
<4-4,Howard>A story can do two things.

135
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,550
<4-5,Raj>我觉得我要心脏病发作了
<4-5,Raj>Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.

136
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,860
<4-6,Howard>你在制药公司上班
<4-6,Howard>You work in pharmaceuticals--

137
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,500
<4-6,Howard>难道没有什么药可以治治他吗
<4-6,Howard>don't you have anything you can give him?

138
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,070
<4-7,Bernadette>我只有新出的尿流药
<4-7,Bernadette>All I have is our new urine flow drug.

139
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,120
<4-7,Bernadette>虽然缓解不了他的紧张
<4-7,Bernadette>Won't help with his anxiety,

140
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,620
<4-7,Bernadette>但药效强劲  他尿尿的时候
<4-7,Bernadette>but it's so strong, when he pees

141
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,040
<4-7,Bernadette>会像穿着喷气背包在屋子里乱飞
<4-7,Bernadette>he'll fly around the room like he's got a jet pack.

142
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,700
<4-8,Raj>我没有办法不去想这件事
<4-8,Raj>I can't stop thinking about it.

143
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,230
<4-9,Bernadette>你担心也不会改变任何事
<4-9,Bernadette>You know, worrying won't have any effect on what happens.

144
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,280
<4-10,Raj>我知道
<4-10,Raj>I know.

145
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,910
<4-11,Howard>或许你需要做一些更有用的事情
<4-11,Howard>Maybe you need to do something more productive.

146
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,580
<4-11,Howard>好吧
<4-11,Howard>Okay.

147
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,780
<4-12,Raj>如果这个瓶子
<4-12,Raj>If I make this shot

148
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,470
<4-12,Raj>能扔进垃圾桶
<4-12,Raj>in the trash can,

149
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,390
<4-12,Raj>就表示探测器顺利到达
<4-12,Raj>the probe will have arrived

150
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,370
<4-12,Raj>并处于能正常运作的状态
<4-12,Raj>in perfect working order.

151
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,430
<4-13,Howard>所以你除了抓狂  就只能让你的运动技能
<4-13,Howard>So, in addition to being crazy, you're resting the fate

152
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,800
<4-13,Howard>来决定这任务的命运吗
<4-13,Howard>of the mission on your athletic prowess.

153
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:29,990
<4-14,Raj>是的
<4-14,Raj>Yes.

154
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,160
<4-15,Howard>曾撞烂过健身固定脚踏车的超低运动技能点
<4-15,Howard>The man who crashed his stationary bike.

155
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,220
<4-16,Raj>我没有撞烂它  好吗
<4-16,Raj>I didn't crash it, okay?

156
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,890
<4-16,Raj>我的歌单节奏太快了
<4-16,Raj>My playlist was too up-tempo,

157
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,000
<4-16,Raj>音浪太强  头晕于是撞到地上
<4-16,Raj>I got light-headed and I fell off.

158
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,520
<4-16,Raj>好了
<4-16,Raj>Okay.

159
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,740
<4-16,Raj>行不行
<4-16,Raj>It all...

160
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,370
<4-16,Raj>就取决于
<4-16,Raj>comes down...

161
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,730
<4-16,Raj>这一下了
<4-16,Raj>to this.

162
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,000
<4-17,Howard>开心了吧  现在你可以放心了
<4-17,Howard>You happy? Now you can relax.

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,270
<4-18,Raj>你是哪门子科学家啊
<4-18,Raj>What kind of scientist are you?

164
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,950
<4-18,Raj>地球人都知道要三投两中才算
<4-18,Raj>Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.

165
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,260
<5-1,Leonard>其实也没那么坏
<5-1,Leonard>This isn't so bad.

166
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,660
<5-2,Sheldon>你说得倒轻巧
<5-2,Sheldon>That's easy for you to say.

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,110
<5-2,Sheldon>你的椅子又没正对着内衣物区
<5-2,Sheldon>Your chair's not facing the lingerie section.

168
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,100
<5-2,Sheldon>天啊  好多小内内哦
<5-2,Sheldon>Boy, that's a lot of panties.

169
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,150
<5-3,Amy>你们俩待得舒服吗  可能要等很久哦
<5-3,Amy>You guys comfy? This might take a while.

170
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,720
<5-4,Sheldon>我不明白为什么女人要坚持
<5-4,Sheldon>You know, I don't understand why women insist

171
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,430
<5-4,Sheldon>没完没了地买衣服
<5-4,Sheldon>on making a big production out of buying clothes.

172
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,050
<5-5,Penny>你说得对  我们应该向你学习
<5-5,Penny>No, you're right, we should do what you do.

173
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,270
<5-5,Penny>让自己妈妈从休斯顿寄来在超市买的裤子
<5-5,Penny>Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.

174
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,190
<5-6,Sheldon>那里有个人
<5-6,Sheldon>They have a man there

175
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,310
<5-6,Sheldon>了解我的个人穿衣风格好吗
<5-6,Sheldon>who understands my personal style.

176
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,940
<5-7,Penny>再见啦
<5-7,Penny>Bye.

177
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,210
<5-8,Leonard>我有个坏消息
<5-8,Leonard>Uh, I've got some bad news.

178
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,990
<5-8,Leonard>这里面没有手机信号
<5-8,Leonard>There's no cell service in here.

179
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,040
<5-8,Leonard>算啦  没关系
<5-8,Leonard>Well, that's all right.

180
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,340
<5-9,Sheldon>智能手机没面世前
<5-9,Sheldon>There were plenty of ways to pass the time

181
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,570
<5-9,Sheldon>也有很多消磨时间的方式啊
<5-9,Sheldon>before smart phones were invented.

182
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,810
<5-10,Leonard>那倒是
<5-10,Leonard>That's true.

183
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,960
<5-11,Sheldon>我用手机搜搜
<5-11,Sheldon>I'll look them up.

184
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,490
<5-11,Sheldon>去他个小饼干
<5-11,Sheldon>Son of a biscuit.

185
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,020
<5-12,Leonard>谢尔顿  没关系啦
<5-12,Leonard>Sheldon, it's fine.

186
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,350
<5-13,Sheldon>不  有关系
<5-13,Sheldon>No, it's not fine.

187
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,700
<5-13,Sheldon>这都21世纪了  怎么还会有店没有无线网的
<5-13,Sheldon>What kind of store in the 21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi?

188
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,110
<5-13,Sheldon>我要打去他们公司总部投诉
<5-13,Sheldon>I'm going to call their corporate office...

189
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,340
<5-13,Sheldon>去他个小饼干
<5-13,Sheldon>Son of a biscuit!

190
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:17,040
<6-1,Sheldon>我想想啊  我的军队要袭击
<6-1,Sheldon>Let's see, my armies are going to attack

191
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,480
<6-1,Sheldon>巴克兰的一个郡[魔戒地名]
<6-1,Sheldon>the Shire from Buckland.

192
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,600
<6-2,Leonard>我的骰子点数是
<6-2,Leonard>And I roll...

193
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,570
<6-1,Sheldon>一个五  一个三
<6-1,Sheldon>a five and a three.

194
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,680
<6-1,Sheldon>好的
<6-1,Sheldon>Okay.

195
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,440
<6-2,Leonard>为了捍卫家园  我的点数是
<6-2,Leonard>And to defend, I roll...

196
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,500
<6-2,Leonard>两个六  我赢了
<6-2,Leonard>two sixes. I win.

197
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,330
<6-3,Sheldon>天啊  又是两个六
<6-3,Sheldon>Boy, double-sixes again.

198
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,570
<6-3,Sheldon>要不是我亲眼看见
<6-3,Sheldon>You know... if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

199
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,220
<6-3,Sheldon>我真不敢相信
<6-3,Sheldon>I wouldn't believe it.

200
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,000
<6-3,Sheldon>我想知道我们还要在这里待多久
<6-3,Sheldon>I wonder how long we're gonna be stuck here.

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,860
<6-4,Leonard>我不知道  但她们为我们付出了很多
<6-4,Leonard>I don't know, but the girls do a lot for us.

202
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,230
<6-4,Leonard>这是我们该做的
<6-4,Leonard>It's the least we can do.

203
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,370
<6-5,Sheldon>那倒是
<6-5,Sheldon>Oh, that's true.

204
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,690
<6-5,Sheldon>我想只有双方做出让步才公平吧
<6-5,Sheldon>I suppose it's only fair we make compromises.

205
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,990
<6-6,Leonard>瞧瞧你  居然如此成熟
<6-6,Leonard>Look at you, being all mature.

206
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,250
<6-7,Sheldon>我不懂你有什么好惊讶的
<6-7,Sheldon>I don't know why you're so surprised.

207
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,940
<6-7,Sheldon>跟你住在一起这么多年了
<6-7,Sheldon>If there's one thing I know about after living with you

208
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,460
<6-7,Sheldon>我唯一学会的事情  就是做出让步
<6-7,Sheldon>for so many years, it's how to compromise.

209
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,740
<6-8,Leonard>你说什么
<6-8,Leonard>I-I'm sorry?

210
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,290
<6-8,Leonard>你为我做出让步吗
<6-8,Leonard>You make compromises for me?

211
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,680
<6-9,Sheldon>一直如此啊
<6-9,Sheldon>All the time.

212
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,890
<6-10,Leonard>在这个地球
<6-10,Leonard>On Earth?

213
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,370
<6-10,Leonard>在我们的生活中
<6-10,Leonard>In our lives?

214
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,700
<6-10,Leonard>在我们现在活着的世界里吗
<6-10,Leonard>That-That we're living?

215
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,620
<6-11,Sheldon>是啊  我...
<6-11,Sheldon>Oh, yes. I...

216
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,110
<6-11,Sheldon>就在昨天  你吃午饭的时候
<6-11,Sheldon>Just yesterday, you had a-a big piece of lettuce

217
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,620
<6-11,Sheldon>牙齿上有一大片菜叶子
<6-11,Sheldon>stuck in your teeth at lunch.

218
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,530
<6-11,Sheldon>我有说什么吗
<6-11,Sheldon>Did I say anything?

219
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,360
<6-11,Sheldon>完全没有
<6-11,Sheldon>No.

220
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,210
<6-11,Sheldon>我做出让步
<6-11,Sheldon>I compromised

221
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,640
<6-11,Sheldon>闭上了我的嘴
<6-11,Sheldon>and kept my mouth shut.

222
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,220
<6-11,Sheldon>你当时也该闭上嘴  因为大家都在笑你
<6-11,Sheldon>Like you should've, because everyone was laughing at you.

223
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,790
<6-12,Leonard>你这不是让步
<6-12,Leonard>That is not a compromise.

224
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,970
<6-12,Leonard>让步是我总得开车载你出门
<6-12,Leonard>A compromise is me driving you everywhere

225
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,920
<6-12,Leonard>因为你不肯学开车
<6-12,Leonard>because you refuse to learn how.

226
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,140
<6-13,Sheldon>我会开车了  艾米教过我
<6-13,Sheldon>Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.

227
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,030
<6-14,Leonard>什么  那你怎么不自己开
<6-14,Leonard>What? Then-Then why don't you do it?

228
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,070
<6-15,Sheldon>因为开车好可怕
<6-15,Sheldon>Uh, well, it's scary.

229
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,660
<6-15,Sheldon>有时候我会分不清油门和刹车
<6-15,Sheldon>And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up.

230
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,420
<6-15,Sheldon>但更重要的一点是  载我上班
<6-15,Sheldon>But, more importantly, driving me to work

231
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,860
<6-15,Sheldon>是你生存的意义之一呀
<6-15,Sheldon>is one of the things that gives your life purpose.

232
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,870
<6-15,Sheldon>我可不能残忍地剥夺它
<6-15,Sheldon>I can't take that away from you,

233
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,030
<6-15,Sheldon>所以  我这算是什么呢
<6-15,Sheldon>so... what do I do?

234
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,000
<6-15,Sheldon>拜托  我把答案都送到你嘴边上了
<6-15,Sheldon>Oh, come on, I'm practically feeding you the answer.

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,750
<6-15,Sheldon>我让步了
<6-15,Sheldon>I compromise.

236
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,080
<7-1,Raj>-多谢你来陪我  -乐意之极
<7-1,Raj>- Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company. - I'm happy to.

237
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,790
<7-2,Howard>我觉得出来活动活动对你有好处
<7-2,Howard>I think getting out of the apartment will do you good.

238
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,610
<7-2,Howard>那我们这是要去哪儿
<7-2,Howard>So... where we headed?

239
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,450
<7-3,Raj>如果你不介意的话  我想去寺庙
<7-3,Raj>If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.

240
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,410
<7-4,Howard>兄弟  相信我  你不会想要皈依犹太教
<7-4,Howard>Buddy, trust me, you don't want to convert to Judaism.

241
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,020
<7-4,Howard>我知道我让犹太教看起来很酷
<7-4,Howard>I mean, I know I make it look cool,

242
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,720
<7-4,Howard>但犹太教并不单纯是鸡胸肉和光明节陀螺而已
<7-4,Howard>but... it's not all briskets and dreidels.

243
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,590
<7-5,Raj>我是想去印度教的寺庙
<7-5,Raj>I meant a Hindu temple.

244
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,530
<7-6,Howard>哦  好吧
<7-6,Howard>Oh. Okay.

245
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,820
<7-6,Howard>里面不会和《夺宝奇兵之毁灭神庙》一个样吧
<7-6,Howard>It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right?

246
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,250
<7-6,Howard>不会有长角的光头想挖出我的心吧
<7-6,Howard>Some bald guy with horns isn't gonna rip my heart out.

247
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,250
<7-7,Raj>老兄  那部电影纯粹是帝国主义的幻想
<7-7,Raj>Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy

248
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,540
<7-7,Raj>把和平又善良的古国国民
<7-7,Raj>that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion

249
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,930
<7-7,Raj>意淫成茹毛饮血的野蛮人
<7-7,Raj>look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.

250
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,910
<7-8,Howard>你明明很爱看那电影
<7-8,Howard>You love that movie.

251
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,620
<7-9,Raj>是的  拍得那叫一个牛逼
<7-9,Raj>Yeah, it's pretty great.

252
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,590
<7-10,Howard>你怎么突然开始相信宗教了
<7-10,Howard>I'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.

253
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,560
<7-11,Raj>此话怎讲
<7-11,Raj>Why?

254
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,080
<7-12,Howard>因为我认识你十年了
<7-12,Howard>Well, because I've known you for ten years

255
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,840
<7-12,Howard>你从来没去过寺庙
<7-12,Howard>and you've never gone to temple,

256
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,310
<7-12,Howard>你从没说过自己相信神
<7-12,Howard>you never talked about believing in God,

257
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,940
<7-12,Howard>上一次的印度排灯节  我亲眼目睹你在巴西牛排店
<7-12,Howard>and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow

258
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,980
<7-12,Howard>吞下了两磅圣牛肉
<7-12,Howard>at a Brazilian steak house.

260
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,160
<7-13,Raj>宗教信仰是很私人的事
<7-13,Raj>Religion is a very personal thing.

261
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,400
<7-13,Raj>我是有去寺庙啊  我只是没说而已
<7-13,Raj>I do go to temple-- I just... I don't talk about it.

262
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,470
<7-14,Howard>可你是一位科学家啊
<7-14,Howard>Yeah, but you're a scientist.

263
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,020
<7-15,Raj>那又怎样
<7-15,Raj>So?

264
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,180
<7-16,Howard>身为科学家  你应该相信只有事实和证据
<7-16,Howard>So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe

265
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,750
<7-16,Howard>才是认识宇宙的唯一方法
<7-16,Howard>is through facts and evidence,

266
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,360
<7-16,Howard>怎么现在你又求助于
<7-16,Howard>and now you're counting on some

267
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,680
<7-16,Howard>长了一百只胳膊的恒河蓝妹子[希瓦神]了吗
<7-16,Howard>blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?

268
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,260
<7-17,Raj>你这么说太不敬了
<7-17,Raj>That is so offensive.

269
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,450
<7-17,Raj>你所有的印度教知识都是来自于《夺宝奇兵》吗
<7-17,Raj>Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?

270
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,820
<7-18,Howard>不  还有《辛普森一家》中的印度非法移民阿普
<7-18,Howard>No. There's also Apu from The Simpsons.

271
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,670
<7-19,Raj>很多科学家都相信上帝的
<7-19,Raj>Well, lots of scientists believe in God.

272
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,130
<7-19,Raj>牛顿  法拉第
<7-19,Raj>Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday,

273
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,100
<7-19,Raj>帕斯卡  都是有神论者
<7-19,Raj>uh, Pascal-- all were believers.

274
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,770
<7-19,Raj>就连爱因斯坦也是啊
<7-19,Raj>Even Einstein was famous for

275
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,590
<7-19,Raj>那句反驳量子力学理论的名言
<7-19,Raj>attacking quantum theory on the grounds that

276
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,140
<7-19,Raj>"上帝不会掷骰子"
<7-19,Raj>"God does not play dice with the universe."

277
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,720
<7-20,Howard>他当然相信上帝啦
<7-20,Howard>Well, of course he believed in God--

278
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,460
<7-20,Howard>他跟女神玛丽莲·梦露都睡过了
<7-20,Howard>he slept with Marilyn Monroe.

279
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,990
<7-21,Raj>这事没有证据好吗
<7-21,Raj>Actually there's no proof of that.

280
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,320
<7-22,Howard>你有你的信仰  我有我的性仰
<7-22,Howard>You believe in your religion, I'll believe in mine.

281
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,560
<8-1,Amy>你试得怎么样啊
<8-1,Amy>How's it going in there?

282
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,580
<8-2,Penny>这件上班穿不太合适
<8-2,Penny>Not really a great outfit for work,

283
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,330
<8-2,Penny>除非我们新开了站街女部门
<8-2,Penny>unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division.

284
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,720
<8-2,Penny>-我能问你件事吗  -问呀
<8-2,Penny>- Hey, can I ask you something? - Sure.

285
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,250
<8-4,Penny>我真的会逼你做你不想做的事吗
<8-4,Penny>Do I really force you to do things you don't want to?

286
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,140
<8-5,Amy>是的  不过我不介意
<8-5,Amy>Yeah, but it's okay.

287
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,700
<8-6,Penny>怎么能不介意呢
<8-6,Penny>How is it okay?

288
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,750
<8-7,Amy>我发过誓  如果我能交到朋友
<8-7,Amy>I promised myself, if I ever got friends,

289
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,970
<8-7,Amy>我一定乖乖听他们的话
<8-7,Amy>I'd do whatever they said.

290
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,350
<8-7,Amy>我能在遇到邪教之前认识你  真是太幸运了
<8-7,Amy>Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.

291
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,120
<8-8,Penny>可那是很久以前的事了
<8-8,Penny>Well, you know, that was a long time ago.

292
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,830
<8-8,Penny>你现在是不同的人了
<8-8,Penny>You're a different woman now.

293
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,530
<8-8,Penny>你聪明  你有很多好朋友
<8-8,Penny>You're smart, you've got great friends,

294
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,230
<8-8,Penny>你有男朋友  你也变漂亮了
<8-8,Penny>you've got a boyfriend, you're pretty,

295
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,150
<8-8,Penny>你对时尚完全没有概念  可是...
<8-8,Penny>you have zero fashion sense, but...

296
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,200
<8-8,Penny>总之  今晚你来决定我们干什么吧
<8-8,Penny>Anyway, tonight we're gonna do whatever you want.

297
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,790
<8-10,Penny>-真的吗  -真的
<8-10,Penny>- Really? - Absolutely.

298
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,140
<8-10,Penny>你提议  我们就去做
<8-10,Penny>You name it, we're doing it.

299
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,680
<8-11,Amy>我们去手工博物馆编篮子吧
<8-11,Amy>Basket weaving at the craft museum.

300
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,580
<8-12,Penny>好吧  你都提了
<8-12,Penny>Well, you named it.

301
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,850
<9-1,Sheldon>我又想起了一个
<9-1,Sheldon>Oh, here's another one.

302
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,970
<9-1,Sheldon>我想把苹果煎饼粉放在架子最高层
<9-1,Sheldon>I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf

303
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,740
<9-1,Sheldon>因为苹果是以字母A开头的[Apple]
<9-1,Sheldon>because it starts with an "A,"

304
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,340
<9-1,Sheldon>但我却没这么做
<9-1,Sheldon>but I don't put it there

305
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,520
<9-1,Sheldon>因为我不想让你为我做早饭时
<9-1,Sheldon>because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs

306
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,930
<9-1,Sheldon>摔断你的小短腿
<9-1,Sheldon>when you're supposed to be making my breakfast.

307
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,990
<9-2,Leonard>轮到我说我做出的让步了吗
<9-2,Leonard>Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?

308
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,180
<9-3,Sheldon>我还没说完  不过你说吧
<9-3,Sheldon>I wasn't done, but go ahead.

309
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,720
<9-3,Sheldon>他让了一步  说道
<9-3,Sheldon>He said, compromising.

310
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,340
<9-4,Leonard>就因为你  我不能
<9-4,Leonard>Because of you, I'm not allowed

311
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,610
<9-4,Leonard>调节自己家里的温度
<9-4,Leonard>to adjust the temperature in my own home.

312
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,840
<9-4,Leonard>也不能吹口哨
<9-4,Leonard>I'm not allowed to whistle.

313
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,100
<9-4,Leonard>不能穿可能会吱吱叫的鞋子
<9-4,Leonard>I don't wear shoes that might squeak.

314
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,920
<9-5,Sheldon>你是物理学家  不是马戏团小丑
<9-5,Sheldon>Well, you're a physicist, not a circus clown.

315
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,670
<9-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  你知道我不能和我爱的女人住在一起
<9-6,Leonard>Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with the woman I love

316
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,500
<9-6,Leonard>都是因为你吗
<9-6,Leonard>because of you?

317
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,740
<9-6,Leonard>没有其他理由  只是因为你
<9-6,Leonard>No other reason. Just you.

318
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,120
<9-7,Sheldon>-这是真的吗  -是真的
<9-7,Sheldon>- Is that true? - Yes, it's true.

319
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,150
<9-8,Leonard>上次我提到这事时  你精神崩溃了
<9-8,Leonard>The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown

320
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,930
<9-8,Leonard>跳上火车离家出走
<9-8,Leonard>and got on a train and ran away.

321
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,830
<9-9,Sheldon>考虑到我对这事的历史反应
<9-9,Sheldon>Well, given my history on the subject,

322
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,830
<9-9,Sheldon>你现在提它是不是有点莽撞呢
<9-9,Sheldon>it seems a little reckless to bring it up now.

323
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,090
<9-10,Leonard>你完全不知道你给身边的每一个人
<9-10,Leonard>You have no idea how much you inconvenience

324
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,810
<9-10,Leonard>造成了多大的麻烦
<9-10,Leonard>the lives of everyone around you.

325
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,460
<9-10,Leonard>我都要累死了
<9-10,Leonard>It's exhausting!

326
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,990
<9-10,Leonard>你知道吗
<9-10,Leonard>You know what?

327
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,120
<9-11,Sheldon>你自以为宽容大量
<9-11,Sheldon>You think you're so tolerant,

328
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,080
<9-11,Sheldon>但事实是...
<9-11,Sheldon>but the truth is...

329
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,230
<9-11,Sheldon>你常对我很过分
<9-11,Sheldon>you're mean to me a lot.

330
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,370
<9-11,Sheldon>没错  你以为我听不出你那些冷嘲热讽
<9-11,Sheldon>Yeah, you think that I don't notice all those sarcastic comments

331
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,590
<9-11,Sheldon>看不到你猛翻的那些白眼吗  我都知道
<9-11,Sheldon>and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm?

332
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,940
<9-11,Sheldon>我有着出色的周边视觉
<9-11,Sheldon>I have excellent peripheral vision.

333
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,930
<9-11,Sheldon>天好的时候  我连自己耳朵都看得到
<9-11,Sheldon>On a good day, I can see my ears.

334
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,250
<9-12,Leonard>谢尔顿  如果我伤到了你  我道歉
<9-12,Leonard>Sheldon, I-I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

335
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,570
<9-12,Leonard>但这些话我已经憋了很久了
<9-12,Leonard>I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.

336
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,770
<9-13,Sheldon>那我也道歉
<9-13,Sheldon>Well, I'm sorry, too.

337
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,650
<9-13,Sheldon>而且如果你想和佩妮住在一起
<9-13,Sheldon>And if you want to live with Penny,

338
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,680
<9-13,Sheldon>那你就去吧
<9-13,Sheldon>then I think you should.

339
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,200
<9-14,Leonard>-你是真心的吗  -是的
<9-14,Leonard>- Do you mean that? - Yes.

340
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,420
<9-15,Sheldon>穿好你那吱吱乱响的鞋...
<9-15,Sheldon>Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and...

341
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,440
<9-15,Sheldon>吱吱吱地离开我的生活
<9-15,Sheldon>your way out of my life.

342
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,180
<9-16,Leonard>别这样  别不高兴嘛
<9-16,Leonard>Come on, don't get upset.

343
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,000
<9-17,Sheldon>我才没有不高兴
<9-17,Sheldon>I'm not upset.

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,560
<9-17,Sheldon>我只是在想象没有我最好朋友的世界是如何
<9-17,Sheldon>I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.

345
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,900
<9-18,Leonard>谢尔顿
<9-18,Leonard>Sheldon.

346
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,380
<9-19,Sheldon>没关系
<9-19,Sheldon>It's okay.

347
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,080
<9-20,Leonard>我不是要离开你的世界
<9-20,Leonard>I-I'm not leaving your world.

348
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,460
<9-20,Leonard>只是搬到你对门去住
<9-20,Leonard>I'm just talking about living across the hall.

349
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,970
<9-21,Sheldon>我理解
<9-21,Sheldon>I understand.

350
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,660
<9-21,Sheldon>不论如何  我希望你了解...
<9-21,Sheldon>Either way, I want you to know that...

351
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,930
<9-21,Sheldon>我知道我有多难搞
<9-21,Sheldon>I'm aware of how difficult I can be.

352
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,040
<9-21,Sheldon>所以我只是想说...
<9-21,Sheldon>So I just want to say...

353
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,910
<9-21,Sheldon>谢谢你一直包容我
<9-21,Sheldon>thank you for putting up with me.

354
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,180
<9-22,Leonard>兄弟

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,530
<10-10,Raj>就会懂得  不论发生什么  都没关系
<10-10,Raj>I realize that whatever happens, it's okay.

<11-4,Sheldon>这不是篮子
<11-4,Sheldon>It's not a basket.
