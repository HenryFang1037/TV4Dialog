1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,250
<1-1,Sheldon>你怎么还不睡
<1-1,Sheldon>Why are you up?

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,760
<1-2,Leonard>我怎么睡得着
<1-2,Leonard>How am I supposed to sleep?

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,430
<1-2,Leonard>我结婚还不到24小时
<1-2,Leonard>I've been married less than 24 hours,

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,710
<1-2,Leonard>我的老婆就跟我冷战了
<1-2,Leonard>and my wife isn't speaking to me.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,960
<1-3,Sheldon>或许你可以用更积极的态度看待这件事
<1-3,Sheldon>Perhaps you can think of this in a more positive light.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,010
<1-3,Sheldon>你只用了短短一天
<1-3,Sheldon>In one day, you've managed to do

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,690
<1-3,Sheldon>就达到许多夫妻花了几十年才达到的境界
<1-3,Sheldon>what it takes many couples decades to achieve.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,710
<1-6,Penny>你也睡不着吗
<1-6,Penny>You couldn't sleep either?

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,580
<1-7,Leonard>当然啦
<1-7,Leonard>Of course not.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,670
<1-7,Leonard>我也睡不着
<1-7,Leonard>Me neither.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,400
<1-8,Sheldon>但我只是喉咙痒
<1-8,Sheldon>But I just had a tickle in my throat.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,340
<1-8,Sheldon>不是什么深刻的婚姻问题
<1-8,Sheldon>Not profound marital problems.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,580
<1-9,Leonard>我们该怎么办
<1-9,Leonard>What are we gonna do?

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,600
<1-10,Penny>我也不知道
<1-10,Penny>I don't know.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,690
<1-11,Leonard>求你告诉我  我该怎么补救
<1-11,Leonard>Please, tell me how I can fix it.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,680
<1-12,Sheldon>就怕你不问
<1-12,Sheldon>Glad you asked.

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,260
<1-12,Sheldon>在我看来  有一个简单的解决方法
<1-12,Sheldon>As I see it, there's a simple solution.

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,590
<1-12,Sheldon>你的嘴唇与别女人的嘴唇厮混过
<1-12,Sheldon>Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,210
<1-12,Sheldon>如果想重修旧好
<1-12,Sheldon>It seems only logical that

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,200
<1-12,Sheldon>唯一合理的办法
<1-12,Sheldon>to restore balance to the relationship,

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,570
<1-12,Sheldon>就是你也找别的男人耳鬓厮磨
<1-12,Sheldon>you should find another man and dally with him.

22
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,460
<1-12,Sheldon>我说耳鬓厮磨  是使出浑身解数狂吻一番
<1-12,Sheldon>And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,230
<1-13,Leonard>这是我听过最蠢的一件事了
<1-13,Leonard>Okay, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,460
<1-14,Penny>其实我觉得他说的不无道理
<1-14,Penny>Actually, I think he's onto something.

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,740
<1-15,Leonard>你不会是认真的吧
<1-15,Leonard>Y-You can't be serious.

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,080
<1-15,Leonard>就因为我一时糊涂跟别的女人亲热了
<1-15,Leonard>'Cause I messed up and made out with a girl,

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,940
<1-15,Leonard>所以你也要随便跟别的男人亲热吗
<1-15,Leonard>you're gonna do the same with a random guy?

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,090
<1-16,Sheldon>我目前正好单身
<1-16,Sheldon>I'm currently single.

29
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,110
<1-17,Penny>的确  你单身
<1-17,Penny>That's true. You are.

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,480
<1-18,Leonard>这是要闹哪样
<1-18,Leonard>What is happening?!

31
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,860
<1-19,Sheldon>我来告诉你是要闹哪样
<1-19,Sheldon>I will tell you what is happening.

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,780
<1-19,Sheldon>我要以身拯救我死党的婚姻
<1-19,Sheldon>I am saving my best friend's marriage.

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,280
<1-19,Sheldon>翻译：土澳东部杀人赛  苗疆南部巫女猫
<1-19,Sheldon>蜀道底部猫王八  别扭大菜

43
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,700
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>谢尔顿  看来你不太懂
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>Sheldon, I don't think you understand

44
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,520
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>分手应该怎么样
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>how being broken up works.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,320
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>唯一能让我理清情绪的方法
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>The only way I can sort through my feelings

46
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,360
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>就是我们之间要保持距离
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>is if there is space between us.

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,970
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>每次见到你  都会让我心灵再次受创
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me.

48
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,460
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>一遍又一遍经历那些伤痛
<2-1,Amy (on skype)>I go through the pain all over again.

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,220
<2-2,Sheldon>我也向你问好
<2-2,Sheldon>Well, hello to you, too.

50
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,120
<2-3,Amy>你想干嘛

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,340
<2-4,Sheldon>我知道我们已经不是一对了
<2-4,Sheldon>I understand we're no longer a couple,

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,490
<2-4,Sheldon>但我想提醒你  我们还有爱的结晶
<2-4,Sheldon>but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.

53
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,090
<2-5,Amy>什么爱的结晶
<2-5,Amy>What baby?

54

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
<2-7,Amy>我要挂电话了
<2-7,Amy>I'm hanging up.

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,960
<2-8,Sheldon>好的  咱们半小时后见

<2-9,Amy>谢尔顿  我才不要跟你录那个节目
<2-9,Amy>Sheldon, I am not doing "Fun With Flags" with you.

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,610
<2-10,Sheldon>为啥不要
<2-10,Sheldon>Why not?

60
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,790
<2-11,Amy>因为我们分手了
<2-11,Amy>Because we're broken up.

61
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,070
<2-12,Sheldon>索尼与雪儿就做到啦
<2-12,Sheldon>Sonny and Cher made it work.

62
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,040
<2-12,Sheldon>索尼与雪儿这对夫妻曾是热门歌唱团体
<2-12,Sheldon>还共同主持过综艺节目

63
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,560
<2-12,Sheldon>他们的综艺节目在离婚后还维持了很久
<2-12,Sheldon>Their variety show kept going long after the divorce,

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,360
<2-12,Sheldon>直到现在还被我们聊起
<2-12,Sheldon>and here we are still talking about them.

65
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,630
<2-13,Amy>没人聊索尼与雪儿好吗
<2-13,Amy>No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.

66
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,750
<2-14,Sheldon>你一定是想到了唐尼与玛丽
<2-14,Sheldon>You must be thinking about Donny and Marie,

67
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,640
<2-14,Sheldon>又被人称为奥斯蒙兄妹
<2-14,Sheldon>同在70年代主持过知名综艺节目

68
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,740
<2-14,Sheldon>因为我跟你绝对是在聊索尼与雪儿
<2-14,Sheldon>'cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.

69
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,590
<2-15,Amy>谢尔顿  到此为止吧
<2-15,Amy>Sheldon, this has to stop.

70
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,030
<2-15,Amy>我知道这很困难
<2-15,Amy>I know it's hard.

71
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,800
<2-15,Amy>这对我也不容易
<2-15,Amy>It's hard for me, too.

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,630
<2-15,Amy>但分手后的这两天
<2-15,Amy>But I've seen and talked to you more

73
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,080
<2-15,Amy>我们见面与说话的量
<2-15,Amy>in the two days we've been broken up

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,930
<2-15,Amy>远远胜过我们分手前两个月的总和
<2-15,Amy>than in the last two months that we were together.

75
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,330
<2-16,Sheldon>如果你想少见到我一点
<2-16,Sheldon>Well, if you want to see less of me,

76
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,450
<2-16,Sheldon>那或许我们应该重修旧好
<2-16,Sheldon>maybe we should go out again.

77
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,740
<3-1,Raj>真不敢相信你跟曼蒂·周亲热过
<3-1,Raj>I can't believe you made out with Mandy Chao.

78
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,970
<3-2,Leonard>相信我  我希望这事从未发生过
<3-2,Leonard>Trust me, I wish it never happened.

79
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,220
<3-3,Raj>而你一直以来都知道这事
<3-3,Raj>And you knew about this this whole time?

80
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,250
<3-4,Howard>是的
<3-4,Howard>I did.

81
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,770
<3-5,Raj>而你没想过告诉我吗
<3-5,Raj>And you didn't think to tell me?

82
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,990
<3-6,Howard>莱纳德要我保密
<3-6,Howard>Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.

83
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,480
<3-7,Raj>现在这事跟莱纳德没关系
<3-7,Raj>Let's leave Leonard out of this for the moment.

84
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,500
<3-7,Raj>这是我跟你之间的事
<3-7,Raj>This is about you and me.

85

<3-9,Raj>我该怎么做才能让你信任我
<3-9,Raj>What do I need to do to make you trust me?

89
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,310
<3-10,Howard>你觉得有一个老婆就很辛苦了吗
<3-10,Howard>You think it's hard having one wife,

90
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,340
<3-10,Howard>你试试有两个
<3-10,Howard>try having two.

92
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,890
<3-11,Raj>他跟曼蒂·周胡搞瞎搞的事情
<3-11,Raj>all about he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.

93
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,290
<3-12,Leonard>我们才没有胡搞瞎搞
<3-12,Leonard>Oh, we didn't screw around.

94
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,870
<3-12,Leonard>我们只是喝醉酒  打个啵儿
<3-12,Leonard>We just got drunk and made out.

95
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,240
<3-13,Raj>随便啦  我更希望这话从你口中听到
<3-13,Raj>Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.

96

<4-1,Amy>你来干嘛

<4-2,Sheldon>情侣分手都这么做
<4-2,Sheldon>That's what people who've broken up do.

99
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,400
<4-3,Amy>而你故意不用你强迫症式的敲门方式
<4-3,Amy>And you didn't do your compulsive knocking ritual

100
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,840
<4-3,Amy>好让我没戒心就开门
<4-3,Amy>so I would open the door.

101
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,380
<4-4,Sheldon>那你就错了
<4-4,Sheldon>On the contrary,

102

106
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,710
<4-6,Sheldon>以免有东西我给忘拿了
<4-6,Sheldon>to make sure I haven't forgotten anything?

111
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,180
<4-9,Amy>而你在一边扶着扶手
<4-9,Amy>and you stood at the rail

112
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,180
<4-9,Amy>一边网上搜失温症的症状那晚吗
<4-9,Amy>Googling the symptoms of hypothermia?

113

<4-10,Sheldon>我们俩真是天造地设的一对啊
<4-10,Sheldon>We made one heck of a team, huh?

129
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,190
<5-3,Howard>但那个店员说
<5-3,Howard>but the guy at the store said

130
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,770
<5-3,Howard>五到七年内  就能收回成本
<5-3,Howard>in five to seven years, it'll pay for itself.

131
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,210
<5-4,Bernadette>什么东西收回成本
<5-4,Bernadette>What will pay for itself?

132
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,540
<5-5,Howard>没什么  那你在气什么呀
<5-5,Howard>Doesn't matter. What are you mad about?

133
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,350
<5-6,Bernadette>我气你告诉我
<5-6,Bernadette>I'm mad at you for blabbing to me

134
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,890
<5-6,Bernadette>莱纳德在北海的所作所为
<5-6,Bernadette>what Leonard did on the North Sea,

135
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,580
<5-6,Bernadette>我还气你让我瞒了佩妮整整两年
<5-6,Bernadette>and I'm mad that I've had to hide this from Penny for two years.

136
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,710
<5-7,Howard>你完全有权对这些事情生气
<5-7,Howard>And you have every right to be mad about those things.

137
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,810
<5-7,Howard>不如这个月的
<5-7,Howard>So, why don't you let me

138
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,320
<5-7,Howard>信用卡账单我来处理  怎么样
<5-7,Howard>handle the credit card bill this month, huh?

139
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,130
<5-7,Howard>你别管了  连看都不用看
<5-7,Howard>I mean, don't even look at it.

140
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,380
<5-8,Bernadette>如果佩妮发现我一直都知道
<5-8,Bernadette>I mean, if Penny finds out I've known all this time

141
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,530
<5-8,Bernadette>却没有告诉她
<5-8,Bernadette>and haven't told her,

142
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,840
<5-8,Bernadette>她肯定会认为我是一个坏朋友
<5-8,Bernadette>she's gonna think I'm a terrible friend.

143
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,130
<5-9,Howard>真希望你从未告诉我
<5-9,Howard>I wish you never told me.

144
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,480
<5-9,Howard>我也希望莱纳德从未告诉我
<5-9,Howard>And I wish Leonard never told me.

145
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,090
<5-9,Howard>他才是最坏的那个
<5-9,Howard>He's the bad guy here.

146
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,020
<5-10,Bernadette>的确是
<5-10,Bernadette>I guess that's true.

147
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,550
<5-11,Howard>而你还让佩妮嫁给他
<5-11,Howard>And you let Penny marry him.

148
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,840
<5-11,Howard>比起这个  我买的乔治·克鲁尼
<5-11,Howard>Compared to that, who cares if I bought

149
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
<5-11,Howard>限量版的体毛修剪套装根本不值得一提
<5-11,Howard>a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?

150
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,100
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>你好  我想预约你们的婚姻咨询服务
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>Hi. I'm calling about your marriage counseling services

151
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,780
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>请问一般怎么收费
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>and was curious what your rate is.

152
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,390
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>不是吧
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>Really?

153
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,610
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>好吧
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>Um, okay.

154
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,790
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>能根据婚姻的长短打折吗
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage?

155
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,520
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>我说的是以小时计算的婚姻
<6-1,Leonard (on phone)>'Cause we're just talking hours here.

156
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,070
<6-3,Leonard>-在呀  -等会打给你
<6-3,Leonard>- Hi. - Call you back.

157
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,430
<6-4,Penny>我们能聊聊吗
<6-4,Penny>Can we talk?

158
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,290
<6-5,Leonard>我十分乐意
<6-5,Leonard>I would love that.

159
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,640
<6-6,Penny>听着
<6-6,Penny>All right, look,

160
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,390
<6-6,Penny>很抱歉在结婚之前
<6-6,Penny>I'm sorry I said I was okay with everything

161
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,680
<6-6,Penny>我说我不介意
<6-6,Penny>before we got married.

162
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,290
<6-6,Penny>我讨厌我们现在有这矛盾
<6-6,Penny>I hate that we're going through this,

163
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,260
<6-6,Penny>但我不知道该怎么做
<6-6,Penny>but I don't know what to do.

164
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,860
<6-7,Leonard>如果你不介意等团购劵出来
<6-7,Leonard>If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon,

165
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,410
<6-7,Leonard>我们可以试试婚姻咨询
<6-7,Leonard>we can try marriage counseling.

166
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,650
<6-8,Sheldon (entering)>你们在呀
<6-8,Sheldon (entering)>Hello.

167
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,770
<6-9,Leonard>伙计
<6-9,Leonard>Hey, uh, buddy,

168
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,220
<6-9,Leonard>你能回避一下吗
<6-9,Leonard>can we have some privacy?

169
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,400
<6-10,Sheldon>当然可以
<6-10,Sheldon>Oh, of course.

170
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,140
<6-10,Sheldon>我也不想打扰你们
<6-10,Sheldon>Wouldn't want to intrude.

171
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,460
<6-10,Sheldon>这是你的
<6-10,Sheldon>This is yours.

172
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,570
<6-11,Penny>等我跟他谈完
<6-11,Penny>Okay, when I'm done with him,

173
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,690
<6-11,Penny>咱俩再好好聊聊
<6-11,Penny>I'm gonna need more information.

174
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,240
<6-12,Sheldon>没什么不妥的
<6-12,Sheldon>Nothing odd.

175
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,080
<6-12,Sheldon>我就拿来让艾米难堪而已
<6-12,Sheldon>I just wanted to rub Amy's nose in it.

176
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
<6-13,Penny>听着  我可能是反应过度了
<6-13,Penny>Okay, look, I might be overreacting,

177
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,520
<6-13,Penny>但我怎么可能明知道
<6-13,Penny>but how am I supposed to get past this

178
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,250
<6-13,Penny>你明天去上班就会见到她  我怎么不介意
<6-13,Penny>when I know tomorrow you're gonna go to work

179
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,280
<6-13,Penny>会见到这个女人
<6-13,Penny>and see this woman?

180
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,150
<6-14,Sheldon>原谅我偷听了
<6-14,Sheldon>Forgive me for eavesdropping,

181
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,380
<6-14,Sheldon>但在我看来  有一个简单的解决办法
<6-14,Sheldon>but as I see it, there's a simple solution.

182
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,970
<6-15,Leonard>醒醒  快醒醒
<6-15,Leonard>Wake up, wake up, wake up.

183
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,570
<6-16,Sheldon>带佩妮去见曼蒂
<6-16,Sheldon>Bring Penny to meet Mandy.

184
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,980
<6-17,Leonard>为什么
<6-17,Leonard>What? Why?

185
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,020
<6-18,Sheldon>现在佩妮的胡思乱想根本停不下来
<6-18,Sheldon>Well, right now, Penny's imagination is running wild,

186
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,000
<6-18,Sheldon>但如果她们见面了  就能消除曼蒂的神秘感
<6-18,Sheldon>but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,730
<6-18,Sheldon>减轻佩妮的恐惧感
<6-18,Sheldon>and alleviate her fears.

188
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,890
<6-18,Sheldon>就像那个独眼龙揭了眼罩让我看
<6-18,Sheldon>Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.

189
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,940
<6-19,Leonard>首先  你把人家弄哭了
<6-19,Leonard>Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.

190
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,960
<6-20,Sheldon>而我们学到了  没有眼珠也能哭
<6-20,Sheldon>And we learned that you don't need an eyeball to do that.

191
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,490
<6-21,Leonard>其次  带佩妮去见曼蒂
<6-21,Leonard>Secondly, I can't think of a more horrible idea

192
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,510
<6-21,Leonard>这个主意糟透了
<6-21,Leonard>than Penny meeting Mandy.

193
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,160
<6-22,Penny>是吗  怎么说
<6-22,Penny>Really? Why is that?

194
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,500
<6-23,Leonard>怎么  你还真想见她
<6-23,Leonard>What, you actually want to meet her?

195
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,990
<6-24,Penny>不啊  但现在看你对此反应异常
<6-24,Penny>No, but now that you're being weird about it,

196
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,830
<6-24,Penny>或许我真该去
<6-24,Penny>maybe I should.

197
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,110
<6-25,Leonard>我才没有反应异常
<6-25,Leonard>I'm not being weird.

198
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,050
<6-25,Leonard>我有反应异常吗
<6-25,Leonard>Am I being weird?

199
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,700
<6-25,Leonard>有啊
<6-25,Leonard>Yes.

200
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,650
<6-26,Sheldon>连我这种怪咖都这么觉得
<6-26,Sheldon>And that's coming from me.

201
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,690
<6-27,Leonard>好吧  你想见她吗
<6-27,Leonard>Fine, you want to meet her?

202
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,250
<6-28,Penny>不  我只想知道你们俩上班时
<6-28,Penny>No, I just want to know that when you're at work,

203
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
<6-28,Penny>不会发生任何越轨的事
<6-28,Penny>there's nothing going on.

204
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,820
<6-29,Leonard>我得说多少遍你才信
<6-29,Leonard>How many times do I have to tell you?

205
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,830
<6-29,Leonard>我对这个女人一点兴趣都没有
<6-29,Leonard>I have no interest in this woman.

206
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,550
<6-30,Penny>或许人家对你有兴趣呢
<6-30,Penny>Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.

207
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,500
<6-31,Sheldon>对莱纳德吗
<6-31,Sheldon>In Leonard?

208
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,750
<6-31,Sheldon>就连独眼龙都看得出没可能好吗
<6-31,Sheldon>Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that's unlikely.

209
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,680
<7-1,Penny>我想我最在意的点就是
<7-1,Penny>I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard

210
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,890
<7-1,Penny>我从来没想过莱纳德也会做这种事
<7-1,Penny>as the kind of guy who woulde do something like this.

211
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,660
<7-2,Amy>人容易在脆弱的时候犯错
<7-2,Amy>Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.

212
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,210
<7-3,Penny>你觉得呢
<7-3,Penny>What do you think?

213
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,690
<7-4,Bernadette>我完全没有想法
<7-4,Bernadette>Oh, I don't know what to think.

214
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,630
<7-4,Bernadette>再重申一次  我是刚刚才知道这事
<7-4,Bernadette>But then again, I just found out about it.

215
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,460
<7-5,Penny>我之所以爱上莱纳德
<7-5,Penny>You know, I fell in love with Leonard

216
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,770
<7-5,Penny>是因为他和我曾经交往过的
<7-5,Penny>because he wasn't anything like the guys

217
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,000
<7-5,Penny>其他人不同
<7-5,Penny>I was used to dating.

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,110
<7-5,Penny>我知道那些渣男都喜欢出轨
<7-5,Penny>I mean, I knew those guys weren't above cheating

219
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,830
<7-5,Penny>因为我就是他们的小三
<7-5,Penny>because that's usually how we met.

220
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,760
<7-6,Amy>你知道莱纳德不是那样的人
<7-6,Amy>Come on, you know Leonard's not like that.

221
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,280
<7-7,Penny>我很想相信你  真的
<7-7,Penny>I want to believe you. I really do.

222
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,480
<7-7,Penny>是我好傻好天真了吗
<7-7,Penny>Am I being naive?

223
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,450
<7-8,Bernadette>我不知道
<7-8,Bernadette>Oh, I don't know.

224
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,630
<7-8,Bernadette>第一次听到这事
<7-8,Bernadette>This is all so new to me.

225
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,990
<7-8,Bernadette>我还在努力消化中
<7-8,Bernadette>I'm still processing.

226
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,430
<7-9,Penny>我们刚认识时  他根本不可能做这种事
<7-9,Penny>You know, he never would've done this when we first met.

227
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,040
<7-9,Penny>他现在可能耐了
<7-9,Penny>He's cockier now.

228
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,510
<7-10,Amy>那是因为你让他变得自信了
<7-10,Amy>That's because you made him more confident.

229
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,650
<7-11,Bernadette>你仔细想想  如果没有你
<7-11,Bernadette>You know, if you think about it, without you,

230
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,440
<7-11,Bernadette>怎么可能有现在意气风发的他
<7-11,Bernadette>he never would've grown into the person he is now.

231
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,400
<7-11,Bernadette>虽然他现在受欢迎了
<7-11,Bernadette>I mean, sure, more women might notice him,

232
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,840
<7-11,Bernadette>但他愿意放弃弱水三千
<7-11,Bernadette>but I think it's better to have a guy be with you

233
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,890
<7-11,Bernadette>与你相守
<7-11,Bernadette>because he wants to be

234
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,080
<7-11,Bernadette>总好过他觉得自己没人爱  只好巴着你啊
<7-11,Bernadette>and not because he thinks he doesn't have any other choice.

235
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,940
<7-12,Penny>我还从没这样想过
<7-12,Penny>I never thought about it like that.

236
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,440
<7-13,Bernadette>我也没有  这是刚想到的
<7-13,Bernadette>Oh, me neither, not until just now.

237
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,530
<8-1,Sheldon>大家好  我是谢尔顿·库伯博士

<8-1,Sheldon>You may notice that I'm holding a remote control.

240
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,860
<8-1,Sheldon>那是因为我的摄影师兼主持搭档
<8-1,Sheldon>That's because my cameraperson and co-host,

243
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,550
<8-1,Sheldon>我先暂停一会  让你们消化一下
<8-1,Sheldon>I'm going to pause here to let that sink in.

244
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,590
<8-1,Sheldon>好了
<8-1,Sheldon>Okay.

245

<8-1,Sheldon>just click the pause button.

247
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,330
<8-1,Sheldon>但我的节目还得继续
<8-1,Sheldon>But the show must go on.

248
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,740
<8-1,Sheldon>万幸的是  我前女友的一切功能
<8-1,Sheldon>And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do

249
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,460
<8-1,Sheldon>我的右手都可以取代
<8-1,Sheldon>can be taken care of with my right hand.

250
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,410
<8-1,Sheldon>好了  我们不要再提她了
<8-1,Sheldon>Anyway, let's not spend any more time talking about her.

251
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,090
<8-1,Sheldon>我们节目的重点是旗帜
<8-1,Sheldon>We're here to talk about flags.

252
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,180
<8-1,Sheldon>今天的主题是
<8-1,Sheldon>Tonight's theme:

253
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,340
<8-1,Sheldon>国破人亡的国家国旗
<8-1,Sheldon>flags of countries that have been torn apart

254
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,610
<8-1,Sheldon>以及我认为该对此负责的红颜祸水们
<8-1,Sheldon>and the women I have a feeling were responsible.

255
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,200
<8-1,Sheldon>你们知道接受婚姻咨询
<8-1,Sheldon>You guys have any idea how much it costs

256
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,420
<9-1,Leonard>需要多少钱吗
<9-1,Leonard>to see a marriage counselor?

257
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,380
<9-2,Howard>每小时250刀  怎么了
<9-2,Howard>$250 an hour. Why?

258
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,630
<9-3,Raj>你怎么知道
<9-3,Raj>How do you know?

259
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,740
<9-4,Howard>博纳黛特和我偶尔会去参加一次
<9-4,Howard>Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to,

260
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,950
<9-4,Howard>防范于未然嘛
<9-4,Howard>you know, stay on top of things.

261
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,470
<9-5,Raj>而我却是头一次听说这事
<9-5,Raj>And I'm just hearing about this now?

262
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,170
<9-6,Howard>老弟  虽然我俩是好基友
<9-6,Howard>Dude, just because we're best friends

263
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,710
<9-6,Howard>但不代表我非得把所有事都告诉你吧
<9-6,Howard>doesn't mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.

264
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,520
<9-7,Raj>你不是非得要  而是应该主动想要
<9-7,Raj>You don't have to, you should want to.

265
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,500
<9-8,Leonard>这下好了  曼蒂来了
<9-8,Leonard>Oh, great, there's Mandy.

266
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,550
<9-9,Howard>海洋生物学家怎么都这么可爱
<9-9,Howard>Why are marine biologists always so cute?

267
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,060
<9-9,Howard>我不知道
<9-9,Howard>I don't know,

268
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,470
<9-10,Raj>但我愿迷失在她的百慕大"三角洲"中
<9-10,Raj>but I'd like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.

269
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,370
<9-11,Leonard>你这话一点用都没有
<9-11,Leonard>That's not helpful.

270
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,380
<9-12,Howard>那我就不告诉你
<9-12,Howard>Then I won't say

271
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,390
<9-12,Howard>我还想覆盖她表面面积的四分之三了
<9-12,Howard>I'd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.

272
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,050
<9-13,Leonard>你们说完了吗
<9-13,Leonard>Are we done?

273
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,930
<9-14,Raj>没  玩得正开心呢
<9-14,Raj>Not yet, this is fun.

274
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,980
<9-14,Raj>有了
<9-14,Raj>Ooh, I know.

275
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,820
<9-14,Raj>我想让她解放我的"杀人鲸"
<9-14,Raj>I'd let her free my willy.

277
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,100
<9-14,Raj>你要去哪儿
<9-14,Raj>Where you going?

278
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,220
<9-15,Leonard>我要去问她愿不愿意跟佩妮聊聊
<9-15,Leonard>I'm gonna ask her if she'd be willing to talk to Penny,

279
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,730
<9-15,Leonard>告诉佩妮根本不用担心
<9-15,Leonard>tell her she has nothing to worry about.

280
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,180
<9-16,Howard>-莱纳德  等等  -怎么了
<9-16,Howard>- Leonard, wait. - What?

281
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,040
<9-18,Howard>我还想用海绵洗她的小裤裤[海绵宝宝]
<9-18,Howard>I'd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.

282
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,810
<9-19,Raj>好了  我们说完了
<9-19,Raj>Now we are done.

283
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,180
<9-21,Mandy>莱纳德  你好吗
<9-21,Mandy>Oh, hi, Leonard. What's up?

284
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,710
<9-22,Leonard>我能坐下吗
<9-22,Leonard>Uh, do you mind if I sit?

285
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,920
<9-23,Mandy>当然
<9-23,Mandy>Sure.

286
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,640
<9-24,Leonard>那个  我一直在想
<9-24,Leonard>So, um, I've been thinking a lot

287
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,500
<9-24,Leonard>我俩在船上的事
<9-24,Leonard>about you and me and... the boat.

288
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,690
<9-25,Mandy>怎么了
<9-25,Mandy>What about it?

289
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,500
<9-25,Mandy>你知道
<9-25,Mandy>You know...

290
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,860
<9-26,Leonard>我们喝醉以后做的那些事
<9-26,Leonard>what we did, when we were drunk.

291
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,600
<9-27,Mandy>不会吧  我也跟你睡了吗
<9-27,Mandy>Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?

292
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,360
<9-28,Leonard>不  我们只是亲热了
<9-28,Leonard>No, we just made out.

293
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,740
<9-29,Mandy>老天保佑我啊
<9-29,Mandy>Oh. Well, good for me.

294
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,590
<9-29,Mandy>那你来找我干什么
<9-29,Mandy>So what can I do for you?

295
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,560
<9-30,Leonard>好吧  我最近结婚了
<9-30,Leonard>Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.

296
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,400
<9-31,Mandy>恭喜你
<9-31,Mandy>Oh, congratulations!

297
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,100
<9-31,Mandy>和谢尔顿吗
<9-31,Mandy>To Sheldon?

298
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,000
<9-32,Leonard>这个笑话永远都好笑
<9-32,Leonard>Never gets old.

299
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,660
<9-32,Leonard>不  是和一个女孩
<9-32,Leonard>No, no, to a girl.

300
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,880
<9-32,Leonard>总之  我告诉了她我俩的事
<9-32,Leonard>Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me,

301
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,660
<9-32,Leonard>于是她担心我们上班时总见面会出事
<9-32,Leonard>and she's concerned about us seeing each other at work.

302
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,070
<9-33,Mandy>不过是亲一下而已  你干嘛告诉她
<9-33,Mandy>It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?

303
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,830
<9-34,Leonard>因为我不想对她有所隐瞒
<9-34,Leonard>Because I didn't want there to be any secrets between us.

304
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,060
<9-35,Mandy>真的是因为这原因吗
<9-35,Mandy>Is that really the reason?

305
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,890
<9-36,Leonard>不然还能是什么
<9-36,Leonard>What else would it be?

306
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,730
<9-36,Leonard>我不知道
<9-36,Leonard>I don't know.

307
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,910
<9-37,Mandy>听起来像是你故意要破坏你们的感情
<9-37,Mandy>Sounds like you're trying to sabotage the relationship.

308
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,880
<9-38,Leonard>不  不是这样的
<9-38,Leonard>No, I don't think so.

309
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,260
<9-38,Leonard>不过  佩妮也说了同样的话
<9-38,Leonard>Although, Penny did say exactly that.

310
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,110
<9-39,Mandy>那你可得好好思考一下了
<9-39,Mandy>Okay, well, that's something to think about.

311
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,980
<9-40,Leonard>在潜意识里  我总是觉得
<9-40,Leonard>You know, on some level, I've always believed

312
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,640
<9-40,Leonard>我配不上她这样的女人
<9-40,Leonard>that I don't deserve a woman like her.

313
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,780
<9-41,Mandy>你要在这里思考吗
<9-41,Mandy>Oh, you're gonna think about that right here?

314
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,030
<9-42,Leonard>她真的超漂亮
<9-42,Leonard>I mean, she's really beautiful.

315
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,060
<9-42,Leonard>各种帅哥她都能泡到手
<9-42,Leonard>She could have any guy she wants.

316
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,780
<9-42,Leonard>所以
<9-42,Leonard>Which is probably why

317
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,820
<9-42,Leonard>花了好多年时间她才对我说她爱我
<9-42,Leonard>it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.

318
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,950
<9-43,Mandy>这事你去找咨询师聊聊吧
<9-43,Mandy>Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.

319
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,700
<9-44,Leonard>太贵了
<9-44,Leonard>Too expensive.

320
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,470
<9-44,Leonard>我可能习惯了女人不对我表达爱意
<9-44,Leonard>You'd think I'd be used to women withholding their love.

321
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,750
<9-44,Leonard>我妈妈就是
<9-44,Leonard>I mean, my mother did.

322
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,030
<9-44,Leonard>不管我有多努力
<9-44,Leonard>I mean, no matter how hard I tried,

323
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,380
<9-44,Leonard>她就是对我不感兴趣
<9-44,Leonard>she just didn't have any interest in me.

324
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,860
<9-45,Mandy>好惨哦
<9-45,Mandy>Imagine that.

325
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,590
<9-46,Leonard>我怀疑也许这就是为什么
<9-46,Leonard>I wonder if that's why I have

326
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,480
<9-46,Leonard>我会跟谢尔顿有这么不正常的关系
<9-46,Leonard>such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon.

327
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,910
<9-46,Leonard>某晚我做梦
<9-46,Leonard>I had a dream

328
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,530
<9-46,Leonard>梦见我在一个山洞里
<9-46,Leonard>the other night that I was in a cave

329
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,230
<9-46,Leonard>哺育一个婴儿
<9-46,Leonard>and I was nursing a baby,

330
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,180
<9-46,Leonard>但这个婴儿长着谢尔顿的脑袋
<9-46,Leonard>but the baby had Sheldon's head on it.

331
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,970
<9-47,Mandy>而你妻子担心的人却是我吗
<9-47,Mandy>And your wife is worried about me?

332
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,350
<9-48,Raj>莱纳德
<9-48,Raj>Hey, Leonard!

333
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,260
<9-48,Raj>你说完就过来
<9-48,Raj>When you're done,

334
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,910
<9-48,Raj>我们又想到了好多段子
<9-48,Raj>we came up with a bunch more.

335
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,650
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>然后捷克共和国对斯洛伐克说
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>Then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia,

336
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,620
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>"看来你不太懂分手应该怎么样"
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>"I don't think you understand how being broken up works!"

337
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,100
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>你能相信吗
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>Can you believe that?

338
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,300
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>你以为捷克共和国
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>You'd think that the Czech Republic

339
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,660
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>会珍惜自己仅有的机会
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>would try to hold on to what it had,

340
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,870
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>毕竟它也不年轻了
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>given that it's not as young as it used to be.

341
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,220
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>而且我也没见过哪个国家
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>And I don't see any other countries

342
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,850
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>在排队要侵略她"南线"[下边]的
<10-1,Sheldon (on screen)>lining up to invade its southern borders.

343
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,890
<10-2,Amy>我要杀了他
<10-2,Amy>I'm gonna kill him.

344
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,390
<10-3,Sheldon>捷克共和国就说到这里
<10-3,Sheldon>But enough about the Czech Republic.

345
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,150
<10-3,Sheldon>我们再说说摩尔多瓦给罗马尼亚
<10-3,Sheldon>Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania

346
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,100
<10-3,Sheldon>做了一个生日蛋糕
<10-3,Sheldon>a birthday cake

347
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,940
<10-3,Sheldon>罗马尼亚说好吃
<10-3,Sheldon>and Romania said it tasted good

348
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,990
<10-3,Sheldon>其实并不然
<10-3,Sheldon>even though it didn't.

349
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,140
<10-3,Sheldon>结果罗马尼亚却被甩了
<10-3,Sheldon>And yet Romania gets dumped.

350
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,860
<10-3,Sheldon>我暂停一下等你理清楚
<10-3,Sheldon>I'll pause here while you mull that one over.

351
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,850
<10-3,Sheldon>的确很扯对吧
<10-3,Sheldon>I know, right?

352
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,370
<11-1,Penny>说吧  不是说有事跟我讲吗
<11-1,Penny>So, you said you had something to tell me.

353
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,850
<11-2,Leonard>对
<11-2,Leonard>Okay, yeah, um,

354
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,720
<11-2,Leonard>还记得你指责我
<11-2,Leonard>do you remember when you accused me

355
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,740
<11-2,Leonard>故意破坏我们的婚礼吗
<11-2,Leonard>of trying to sabotage our wedding?

356
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,450
<11-4,Leonard>我也想了一下
<11-4,Leonard>I've been thinking about it,

357
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,880
<11-4,Leonard>也许你说得对
<11-4,Leonard>and you might be right.

358
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,890
<11-4,Leonard>但好消息是
<11-4,Leonard>But the good news is

359
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,260
<11-4,Leonard>我知道自己为啥这么做
<11-4,Leonard>that I'm pretty sure I know why.

360
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,340
<11-5,Penny>洗耳恭听
<11-5,Penny>I'm listening.

361
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,340
<11-6,Leonard>佩妮  尽管过了这么多年
<11-6,Leonard>Penny, after all these years,

362
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,830
<11-6,Leonard>我还觉得自己配不上你
<11-6,Leonard>I still feel like maybe I don't deserve you.

363
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,820
<11-7,Penny>行了  这是你
<11-7,Penny>Okay, that is the lamest excuse

364
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,360
<11-7,Penny>能胡扯的借口中最烂的一个了
<11-7,Penny>you could've possibly come up with.

365
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,470
<11-7,Penny>但我理解
<11-7,Penny>But I get it.

366
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,590
<11-8,Leonard>-是吗  -是啊
<11-8,Leonard>-You do?  -Yeah.

367
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,140
<11-9,Penny>有时我担心一觉醒来
<11-9,Penny>Sometimes I worry you're gonna wake up

368
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,060
<11-9,Penny>你会为像你这样的女人弃我而去
<11-9,Penny>and leave me for someone more like you.

369
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,850
<11-10,Leonard>我自己都不理解
<11-10,Leonard>I don't even understand

370
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,670
<11-10,Leonard>为什么你会跟我这种男人在一起
<11-10,Leonard>why you're with someone like me.

371
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,620
<11-10,Leonard>我为什么还要找个像我这样的女人呢
<11-10,Leonard>Why would I want to be with someone like me?

372
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,370
<11-11,Penny>你懂我的意思
<11-11,Penny>You know what I mean.

373
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,770
<11-11,Penny>也许我的某些反应
<11-11,Penny>And, you know, maybe the way I've been reacting

374
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,110
<11-11,Penny>也是在搞破坏
<11-11,Penny>was me sabotaging this, too.

375
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,530
<11-12,Leonard>不如我们不要
<11-12,Leonard>Well, how about we stop

376
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,210
<11-12,Leonard>害怕失去彼此
<11-12,Leonard>being so scared of losing each other

377
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,410
<11-12,Leonard>而是要好好在一起
<11-12,Leonard>and just be together?

378
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,840
<11-13,Penny>这主意不错

381
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,860
<11-14,Leonard>自从见到你的那一刻  我便爱上了你
<11-14,Leonard>I've loved you since the moment we met,

382
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,870
<11-14,Leonard>我会一辈子爱你  至死不渝
<11-14,Leonard>and I will keep loving you until the end of time.

383
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,980

<11-16,Leonard>美到我心中满溢着爱与歌
<11-16,Leonard>and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.

387
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,910
<11-17,Penny>越说越烂俗了哦  莱纳德
<11-17,Penny>It's getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.
