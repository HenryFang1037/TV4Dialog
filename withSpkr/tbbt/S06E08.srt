121
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,440
<4-4,Raj>他要是有做的话  腹肌绝对好很多
<4-4,Raj>because if he were, he would have way better abs.

122
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,000
<4-4,Raj>-能听到什么吗  -没呢
<4-4,Raj>- Can you hear anything? - Not yet.

123
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,050
<4-5,Howard>你干嘛呢
<4-5,Howard>What are you doing?

124
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,070
<4-6,Raj>我也听啊
<4-6,Raj>I'm listening.

125
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,540
<4-7,Howard>你不能脸朝另一边听吗
<4-7,Howard>Can't you face the other way and listen?

126
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,980
<4-8,Raj>我做什么你都看不顺眼  是吧
<4-8,Raj>I can't do anything right for you, can I?

127
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,110
<4-9,Howard>他到底躲里面干啥呢
<4-9,Howard>What the hell is he up to?

128
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,810
<4-10,Raj>他是个怪人
<4-10,Raj>He is kind of a weirdo.

129
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,480
<4-10,Raj>说不定把伦纳德·尼莫伊五花大绑在里面
<4-10,Raj>Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there.

131
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,540
<4-10,Raj>或比尔·盖茨
<4-10,Raj>Or Bill Gates.

132
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,270
<4-10,Raj>甚至是史提芬·霍金呢
<4-10,Raj>Or Stephen Hawking.

133
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,460
<4-11,Howard>史提芬·霍金有什么好五花大绑啊
<4-11,Howard>Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?

134
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,310
<4-12,Raj>霍华德  你不能因为人家是残疾人
<4-12,Raj>Howard, please, you can't treat the man differently

135
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,010
<4-12,Raj>就差别待遇啊  歧视是不对的
<4-12,Raj>just because he's disabled. That's not okay.

136
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,440
<5-1,Leonard>你要是对于
<5-1,Leonard>If you're wondering why

137
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,540
<5-1,Leonard>我为何要直盯着窥视孔外有疑惑
<5-1,Leonard>I've been staring through the peephole,

138
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,690
<5-1,Leonard>我是要看看那个
<5-1,Leonard>I'm trying to get a look at this guy

139
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,340
<5-1,Leonard>要来佩妮家的男人
<5-1,Leonard>who's coming over to Penny's.

140
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,620
<5-2,Sheldon>老实说  我都没注意到你在那边
<5-2,Sheldon>To be honest, I didn't know you were here.

141
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,410
<5-2,Sheldon>不是什么大事啦
<5-2,Sheldon>It's not a big deal.

142
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,790
<5-3,Leonard>他只是她历史课的同学
<5-3,Leonard>He's just in her history class.

143
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,260
<5-3,Leonard>他们要一起弄报告
<5-3,Leonard>They're working on a project together.

144
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,730
<5-3,Leonard>我干嘛这么紧张兮兮啊
<5-3,Leonard>I don't even know why I care.

145
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,000
<5-3,Leonard>好吧  我不管了
<5-3,Leonard>You know what, I don't care.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,820
<5-4,Sheldon>自欺欺人而已
<5-4,Sheldon>You think you don't care.

147
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,010
<5-5,Leonard>这样太蠢了
<5-5,Leonard>This is silly.

148
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,010
<5-5,Leonard>我没什么好担心的
<5-5,Leonard>I have nothing to worry about.

149
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,560
<5-6,Sheldon>这可说不准
<5-6,Sheldon>Oh, I don't know.

150
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,130
<5-6,Sheldon>从数据上来看
<5-6,Sheldon>Statistically speaking,

151
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,230
<5-6,Sheldon>我肯定你的确有要担心的事
<5-6,Sheldon>I'm sure you have something to worry about.

152
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,610
<5-7,Leonard>什么意思
<5-7,Leonard>What do you mean?

153
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,040
<5-8,Sheldon>假设你的外貌是算中等
<5-8,Sheldon>Well, if we assume your looks are average,

154
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
<5-8,Sheldon>随便一算
<5-8,Sheldon>right off the bat,

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,110
<5-8,Sheldon>地球上有一半的男人比你还有魅力
<5-8,Sheldon>50% of men on Earth are more attractive than you.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,780
<5-8,Sheldon>代表着有15亿帅气男子在等着
<5-8,Sheldon>That's 1.5 billion handsome lads standing by,

157
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,360
<5-8,Sheldon>浇熄你们的爱火呢
<5-8,Sheldon>waiting to rain on your parade.

158
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,060
<5-9,Leonard>但爱情不是只看外貌啊
<5-9,Leonard>Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks.

159
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,590
<5-9,Leonard>我也有很多部分是高于平均值啊
<5-9,Leonard>I'm way above average in a lot of other things.

160
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,680
<5-10,Sheldon>绝非在身高  视力  运动能力
<5-10,Sheldon>Not height, vision, athleticism,

161
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
<5-10,Sheldon>或消化乳制品这几个领域吧
<5-10,Sheldon>or ability to digest dairy products.

162
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,610
<5-11,Leonard>我是重要的项目赢别人啊
<5-11,Leonard>I'm talking about important things

163
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,800
<5-11,Leonard>例如感情成熟度
<5-11,Leonard>like emotional maturity.

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,940
<5-12,Sheldon>你刚还从那小孔想探查你女友
<5-12,Sheldon>You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.

165
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,140
<5-13,Leonard>我还是比较喜欢你以为我不在那会
<5-13,Leonard>I liked it better when you thought I wasn't here.

166
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,420
<5-14,Sheldon>我也不是说你就没有吸引人的优点
<5-14,Sheldon>I'm not saying you don't have attractive qualities.

167
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,660
<5-14,Sheldon>你的择友能力无懈可击
<5-14,Sheldon>Your choice of friends is impeccable,

168
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,150
<5-14,Sheldon>睡觉安稳不吵闹
<5-14,Sheldon>you're a good sleeper.

169
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,550
<5-14,Sheldon>再提一点
<5-14,Sheldon>And last but not least,

170
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,980
<5-14,Sheldon>你懂得买我喜欢的那种葡萄
<5-14,Sheldon>you buy the grapes I like.

171
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,030
<5-14,Sheldon>你也算是乘龙佳婿了
<5-14,Sheldon>You're a real catch

172
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,810
<5-14,Sheldon>大胜那些睡觉打鼾
<5-14,Sheldon>compared to some snoring guy

173
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,440
<5-14,Sheldon>满冰箱垃圾葡萄的人了
<5-14,Sheldon>with a fridge full of lousy grapes.

174
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,900
<5-15,Leonard>无所谓啦
<5-15,Leonard>None of this matters.

175
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,610
<5-15,Leonard>我相信佩妮在乎我
<5-15,Leonard>I trust that Penny cares about me,

176
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,670
<5-15,Leonard>她也不会跟这男的有什么
<5-15,Leonard>and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.

177
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,320
<5-16,Sheldon>如果他是催眠大师  那可说不准
<5-16,Sheldon>Well, unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.

178
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,490
<5-17,Leonard>什么
<5-17,Leonard>What?

179
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,450
<5-18,Sheldon>虽然很难碰上  但也不是不可能啊
<5-18,Sheldon>While unlikely, it's still a statistical possibility.

180
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,680
<5-18,Sheldon>她现在可能正
<5-18,Sheldon>She might be performing

181
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,380
<5-18,Sheldon>无意识的与他发生性行为呢
<5-18,Sheldon>sexual acts with him and not even know it.

182
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,800
<5-19,Leonard>你扯过头了吧
<5-19,Leonard>Now you're just being ridiculous.

183
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,240
<5-19,Leonard>你确定吗
<5-19,Leonard>Am I?

184
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,570
<5-20,Sheldon>人的意识是很神奇的  莱纳德
<5-20,Sheldon>The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard.

185
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,110
<5-20,Sheldon>那男的可能正一边"爽歪歪"
<5-20,Sheldon>He could be having the time of his life

186
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,850
<5-20,Sheldon>而佩妮只以为自己是吃玉米的鸡呢
<5-20,Sheldon>while she thinks she's a chicken pecking for corn.

187
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,760
<6-1,Raj>瞧咱俩  大半夜鬼鬼祟祟的来这里
<6-1,Raj>Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night

188
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,400
<6-1,Raj>像是一对飞贼一样
<6-1,Raj>like a couple of cat burglars.

189
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,370
<6-2,Howard>我们比较像忍者吧
<6-2,Howard>I think we're more like ninjas.

190
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,600
<6-3,Raj>我不想当忍者  人家想当飞贼
<6-3,Raj>I don't want to be a ninja; I want to be a cat burglar.

191
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,110
<6-4,Howard>行  我当忍者  你当飞贼
<6-4,Howard>Fine, I'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.

192
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,970
<6-5,Raj>不行  咱俩得一样
<6-5,Raj>No, we both have to be the same thing.

193
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,750
<6-5,Raj>好吧  我们都是忍者
<6-5,Raj>Okay, we're ninjas.

194
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,280
<6-6,Howard>谢谢
<6-6,Howard>Thank you.

195
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,020
<6-7,Raj>但下次我们要一起当飞贼哦
<6-7,Raj>But next time, we'll be cat burglars.

196
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,420
<6-9,Raj>-上锁了  -你确定吗
<6-9,Raj>- It's locked. - Are you sure?

197
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,960
<6-10,Howard>我当然确定
<6-10,Howard>Yes, I'm sure.

198
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,730
<6-10,Howard>你去把风  我来...
<6-10,Howard>Now, you stand guard, I'm going to...

199
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,300
<6-11,Raj (trying door)>锁上了
<6-11,Raj (trying door)>It's locked.

200
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,070
<6-12,Howard>去把风就行了
<6-12,Howard>Just keep an eye out.

201
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,040
<6-12,Howard>我很快就能弄开了
<6-12,Howard>I'll have this open in a minute.

202
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,110
<6-13,Raj>你什么时候学的开锁啊
<6-13,Raj>When did you learn how to pick locks?

203
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,170
<6-14,Howard>我中学那会开始学的魔术嘛
<6-14,Howard>When I was starting to do magic in junior high,

204
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,750
<6-14,Howard>当时我想当个逃脱魔术师
<6-14,Howard>I thought I could be an escape artist

205
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,520
<6-14,Howard>像逃脱大师胡迪尼一样
<6-14,Howard>like Harry Houdini.

206
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,550
<6-15,Raj>后来如何了
<6-15,Raj>How did that work out?

207
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,720
<6-16,Howard>挺不错啊
<6-16,Howard>Pretty good.

208
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,450
<6-16,Howard>朋友  人缘  以及我家方圆12英里内
<6-16,Howard>I managed to escape friends, popularity,

209
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,720
<6-16,Howard>所办的任何派对  都"逃脱"我而去了
<6-16,Howard>and every party thrown in a 12-mile radius.

210
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
<6-16,Howard>开了  准备好进去了吗
<6-16,Howard>There. Ready?

211
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
<6-17,Raj>-慢着慢着  -干嘛
<6-17,Raj>- Hold on, hold on. - What?

212
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,900
<6-19,Raj>谢尔顿是个非常聪明的人
<6-19,Raj>Sheldon is a very smart man,

213
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,060
<6-19,Raj>而且显然他想守住这个秘密
<6-19,Raj>and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.

214
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,410
<6-20,Howard>是啊  那又怎样
<6-20,Howard>Yeah, so?

215
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,280
<6-21,Raj>万一有机关陷阱怎么办
<6-21,Raj>What if it's booby-trapped?

216
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,010
<6-22,Howard>别担心  我早就想到了
<6-22,Howard>Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.

217
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,510
<6-23,Raj>那好  你有什么计...
<6-23,Raj>Great, what's your pl...

218
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,820
<6-24,Howard>没事吧
<6-24,Howard>Are we good?

219
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,690
<6-24,Howard>没事
<6-24,Howard>Yeah.

220
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,370
<6-25,Raj>43
<6-25,Raj>Forty-three.

221
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,900
<6-25,Raj>这到底是什么意思呀
<6-25,Raj>What the hell does that mean?

222
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,400
<6-25,Raj>我不知道
<6-25,Raj>I don't know.

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,220
<6-26,Howard>方程式的答案吗
<6-26,Howard>The solution to an equation?

224
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,470
<6-26,Howard>可能是
<6-26,Howard>Maybe.

225
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,890
<6-27,Raj>它是质数
<6-27,Raj>It's a prime number.

226
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,080
<6-27,Raj>加密系统就是基于素数的函数
<6-27,Raj>Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.

227
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,440
<6-28,Howard>谢尔顿有什么秘密是需要加密的啊
<6-28,Howard>What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?

228
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,070
<6-29,Raj>他的鸡蛋沙拉啊
<6-29,Raj>He's always been very cagey about

229
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,160
<6-29,Raj>他一直对让其美味的秘方三箴其口
<6-29,Raj>what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.

230
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,020
<6-30,Howard>其实就是红辣椒
<6-30,Howard>It's paprika.

231
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,940
<6-30,Howard>真的吗
<6-30,Howard>Really?

232
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,360
<6-31,Raj>好吧  解决了一个谜题
<6-31,Raj>Well, okay, one mystery solved.

233
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,130
<7-1,Voice from Outside>晚安
<7-1,Voice from Outside>Okay, good night.

<7-4,Leonard>I'll be right back.

237
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,360
<7-5,Sheldon>我以为你早走了呢
<7-5,Sheldon>I thought you left a long time ago.

238
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,450
<7-7,Cole>你好吗
<7-7,Cole>What's up?

239
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,670
<7-8,Leonard>你要搬到五楼的公寓住吗
<7-8,Leonard>You moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
