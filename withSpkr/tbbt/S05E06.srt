1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,770
<1-1,Leonard>您这次要参加的是什么样的巡航
<1-1,Leonard>So what kind of cruise is this you're going on?

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,110
<1-2,Mrs Cooper>这次水上之行称为"重生之旅"
<1-2,Mrs Cooper>It's called the Born Again Boat Ride.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,880
<1-2,Mrs Cooper>基督教季刊给予了这次旅途最高的评价
<1-2,Mrs Cooper>Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating--

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,380
<1-2,Mrs Cooper>五颗荆棘王冠呢
<1-2,Mrs Cooper>five thorny crowns.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,780
<1-2,Mrs Cooper>我真希望你能跟我一起去  谢尔顿
<1-2,Mrs Cooper>I do wish you'd come with me, Sheldon.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,650
<1-3,Sheldon>老妈  如果我去了就等于直接证明
<1-3,Sheldon>Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,850
<1-3,Sheldon>您的神真的能造就奇迹
<1-3,Sheldon>that your God can work miracles.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,960
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>这你可就错了
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>You're missing out.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,290
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>到时候欢乐肯定无所不在
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>It's gonna be wall-to-wall fun.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,430
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>全都有主题哦
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>It's all themed.

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,530
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>届时能看到"约拿和鲸鱼"[圣经故事]
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>There's Jonah and the Whale watching.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,900
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>你还能吃到名为"最后的晚餐"的自助餐
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,300
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>以及我本人的最爱  "神之恕击"
<1-4,Mrs Cooper>And my personal favorite, Gunning with God.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,800
<1-5,Leonard>我冒昧的问一下  什么叫"神之恕击"
<1-5,Leonard>What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,510
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>说起来非常的有趣
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>Oh, it is a hoot and a half.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,140
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>首先将你的罪恶写在一个泥制飞靶上
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>You write your sins on a clay pigeon,

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,310
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>再用机器把靶子弹射出去
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>they fire 'em up in the air,

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,610
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>然后你拿一把12发弹容的散弹枪打爆它
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,780
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>充满了神的宽恕啊
<1-6,Mrs Cooper>full of our Lord's forgiveness.

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,090
<1-7,Sheldon>老实说  妈妈  我很高兴看到
<1-7,Sheldon>Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,860
<1-7,Sheldon>你们天主教团思想进步了
<1-7,Sheldon>how advanced your group has become--

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,590
<1-7,Sheldon>敢于出海
<1-7,Sheldon>you are willing to sail out into the ocean

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,490
<1-7,Sheldon>不再担心地球是平的 船会摔下去
<1-7,Sheldon>without fear of falling off the edge.

25
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,290
<1-8,Mrs Cooper>打个比方
<1-8,Mrs Cooper>For example,

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,230
<1-8,Mrs Cooper>如果谢利在船上  他应该
<1-8,Mrs Cooper>if Shelly was aboard, he'd write,

27
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,300
<1-8,Mrs Cooper>在飞靶写上"牙尖嘴利"
<1-8,Mrs Cooper>"Smart mouth" on his pigeon,

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,240
<1-8,Mrs Cooper>然后来个五雷轰顶
<1-8,Mrs Cooper>and then bam!

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,640
<1-9,Sheldon>神予之 神毁之
<1-9,Sheldon>The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away.

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,940
<1-9,Sheldon>老妈  根据我们以往周末的安排
<1-9,Sheldon>Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together,

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,150
<1-9,Sheldon>-欢乐应该始于炸鸡  -听起来很美味啊
<1-9,Sheldon>- the fun begins with fried chicken. - Sounds delicious.

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,150
<1-11,Sheldon>很好  因为我已经帮你备齐了所有材料
<1-11,Sheldon>Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it.

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,080
<1-11,Sheldon>你有口福了
<1-11,Sheldon>You are in for a treat.

34
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,050
<1-11,Sheldon>我爸的棺材
<1-11,Sheldon>My mother's fried chicken

35
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,960
<1-11,Sheldon>之所以变成加大号的  就是因为我妈的炸鸡美味
<1-11,Sheldon>is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,620
<1-12,Leonard>谢尔顿  她刚下飞机
<1-12,Leonard>Sheldon, she just got off the plane.

37
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,360
<1-12,Leonard>她不想做饭了
<1-12,Leonard>She doesn't want to cook.

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,960
<1-13,Sheldon>她当然想做
<1-13,Sheldon>Of course she does.

39
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,530
<1-13,Sheldon>做饭给我吃  是她向我表达"我爱你"的方式
<1-13,Sheldon>Making me food is her way of saying "I love you""

40
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,800
<1-13,Sheldon>在她筋疲力尽的时候做给我吃
<1-13,Sheldon>Making me food when she's too tired to cook

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,870
<1-13,Sheldon>是她向我表达"我真的很爱你"的方式
<1-13,Sheldon>is her way of saying "I really love you."

42
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,970
<1-14,Mrs Cooper>其实我并不介意出去吃  谢尔顿
<1-14,Mrs Cooper>Actually, I wouldn't mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.

43
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,470
<1-15,Sheldon>吃那些粗粮
<1-15,Sheldon>Won't that spoil our appetites

44
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,810
<1-15,Sheldon>会坏了吃炸鸡的好胃口吧
<1-15,Sheldon>for the chicken you're going to make me?

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,680
<1-16,Leonard>好了  就这么定了  我们出去吃
<1-16,Leonard>All right, that settles it, we're going out.

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,810
<1-16,Leonard>你喜欢吃寿司吗  街上有家小店不错
<1-16,Leonard>Do you like sushi? There's a great little place down the street.

47
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,150
<1-17,Mrs Cooper>我没吃过寿司
<1-17,Mrs Cooper>I've never had it,

48
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,150
<1-17,Mrs Cooper>不过试试新鲜事物总没什么坏处
<1-17,Mrs Cooper>but there's no harm in trying something new.

49
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,050
<1-18,Sheldon>尝试新鲜事物坏处多了
<1-18,Sheldon>There's a lot of harm in trying something new.

50
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,650
<1-18,Sheldon>所以要用兔子来测试药物和化妆品的安全性
<1-18,Sheldon>That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.

51
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,560
<1-19,Leonard>谢尔顿  你的言行像个疯子
<1-19,Leonard>Sheldon, you're talking like a crazy person.

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,860
<1-20,Mrs Cooper>其实  他小时候我带他检查过了
<1-20,Mrs Cooper>Actually, I had him tested as a child.

53
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,630
<1-20,Mrs Cooper>医生说他很正常
<1-20,Mrs Cooper>Doctor says he's fine.

54
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,230
<1-21,Sheldon>早跟你说了
<1-21,Sheldon>Told you.

55
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,870
<1-22,Mrs Cooper>虽然我很后悔没接着去找
<1-22,Mrs Cooper>Although, I do regret not following up

56
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,100
<1-22,Mrs Cooper>休斯顿的那位专家
<1-22,Mrs Cooper>with that specialist in Houston.

66
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,550
<1-22,Mrs Cooper>欢迎光临
<1-22,Mrs Cooper>いらっしゃいます

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,720
<2-2,Sheldon>别瞎嚷嚷了
<2-2,Sheldon>Stop yelling!

68
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,130
<2-2,Sheldon>来这儿我很不开心
<2-2,Sheldon>I'm not happy about this.

69
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,530
<2-3,Leonard>你这辈子什么时候开心过吗
<2-3,Leonard>What's the last thing you were ever happy about?

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,460
<2-4,Sheldon>等着吃炸鸡的时候
<2-4,Sheldon>The prospect of fried chicken.

71
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,430
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>真令人激动
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>This is exciting.

72
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,040
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>咱家四号公路线那的馆子也卖寿司
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi,

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,110
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>但他们只是把炸鱼排切碎
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>but it's just cut up fish sticks

74
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,710
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>再配上"本恩大叔"牌速食米饭
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>and a side of Uncle Ben's.

75
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,370
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>即使他们用"功夫文"写菜单
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters,

76
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,480
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>但假货就假货
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>but that don't make it sushi.

77
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,420
<2-6,Leonard>额  "功夫文"好像有点种族歧视吧
<2-6,Leonard>Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.

79
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,890
<2-7,Mrs Cooper>我还以为只有"ching chong"是不能说的呢
<2-7,Mrs Cooper>Oh, I thought the one we couldn't say was "ching chong"

80
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,360
<2-8,Leonard>额  对  那个也不能说
<2-8,Leonard>Yeah, yeah, that, too.

81
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,160
<2-9,Mrs Cooper>谢利
<2-9,Mrs Cooper>So, Shelly,

82
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,090
<2-9,Mrs Cooper>你和你的朋友艾米进展如何了
<2-9,Mrs Cooper>what's up with you and your friend Amy,

83
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,530
<2-9,Mrs Cooper>如果你不介意妈妈窥探点隐私的话
<2-9,Mrs Cooper>if you don't mind a mother prying a bit?

84
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,600
<2-10,Sheldon>艾米的确有大进展
<2-10,Sheldon>Well, there's actually big news on the Amy front.

85
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,440
<2-10,Sheldon>她最近在研究
<2-10,Sheldon>She's been studying

86
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,440
<2-10,Sheldon>神经生物学中有关低等生物的上瘾问题
<2-10,Sheldon>the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals.

87
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,610
<2-10,Sheldon>她就差这么一点点  就能让海星迷上可卡因了
<2-10,Sheldon>She's this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.

88
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,910
<2-11,Mrs Cooper>你知道他们两个发展的情况吗
<2-11,Mrs Cooper>Do you have any idea what's going on with those two?

89
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,810
<2-12,Leonard>他们俩的关系就像尼斯湖水怪
<2-12,Leonard>It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster.

90
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,620
<2-12,Leonard>也许事实存在  也许不存在
<2-12,Leonard>Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't.

91
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,320
<2-12,Leonard>真相可能永远藏在湖里
<2-12,Leonard>We'll probably never know.

92
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,620
<2-12,Leonard>偷想这问题来惊吓一下自己  还是挺有意思的
<2-12,Leonard>But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.

93
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,760
<2-13,Mrs Cooper>你跟年轻女孩子相处得怎样
<2-13,Mrs Cooper>How are you doing on the young lady front?

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,630
<2-13,Mrs Cooper>我听闻你被异地恋困扰着
<2-13,Mrs Cooper>I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation?

95
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,800
<2-14,Leonard>是啊  拉杰的妹妹
<2-14,Leonard>Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

96
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,870
<2-14,Leonard>情况比较棘手  她远在印度
<2-14,Leonard>It's kind of tough.  She's in India.

97
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,570
<2-14,Leonard>她父母也不希望她跟白种人交往
<2-14,Leonard>Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.

98
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,870
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>那真是个有趣的转机  不是吗
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?

99
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,040
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>在约会之前  你怎么没想过这个问题呢
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>You never think about it going the other way.

100
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,750
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>有些事情你强求不来
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>Well, you can't force things.

101
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,420
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>你应该想想你们是否真的是在交往
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>You need to figure out if you're in a relationship

102
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,350
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>还是你们只是名义上的
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>or if you're just calling it one.

103
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,030
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>就好像常言道  你可以把米放到电锅里
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>It's like they say--a cat can have kittens in the oven

104
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,130
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>不代表米就会成炊
<2-15,Mrs Cooper>but that don't make 'em biscuits.

105
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,060
<2-16,Sheldon>这提醒了我另外一句常言
<2-16,Sheldon>And that reminds me of another saying.

106
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,160
<2-16,Sheldon>你可以诱拐鸡跳炸锅
<2-16,Sheldon>You can lead a chicken to Crisco,

107
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,660
<2-16,Sheldon>但不代表你能诱拐你妈去炸鸡
<2-16,Sheldon>but you can't make your mother fry it.

108
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,570
<2-17,Mrs Cooper>谢尔顿  你再拿鸡的事情烦我
<2-17,Mrs Cooper>Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken,

109
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,970
<2-17,Mrs Cooper>我就把你按到我膝盖上  当众打你屁股
<2-17,Mrs Cooper>I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.

110
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,140
<2-18,Leonard>求你烦她吧  就当为了我
<2-18,Leonard>Please pester her. Please, for me.

111
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,550
<3-1,Leonard>库珀夫人  你觉得寿司如何
<3-1,Leonard>So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?

112
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,520
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>很不错
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>It was good.

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,020
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>唯一美中不足的是
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>The only thing that would have made it better

114
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,490
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>它要是熟食就好了
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>is if it was cooked

115
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,890
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>要是夹牛肉 就更棒了
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>and if it was beef.

116
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,760
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>谢尔顿  你房东何时能把电梯修理一下
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?

117
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,500
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>我不清楚
<3-2,Mrs Cooper>I don't know.

118
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,130
<3-3,Sheldon>最近我们有在商量
<3-3,Sheldon>Lately we've been talking about

119
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,670
<3-3,Sheldon>把电梯改造成导弹发射井
<3-3,Sheldon>converting it into a missile silo.

120
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,340
<3-4,Leonard>你儿子似乎觉得
<3-4,Leonard>Your son seems to think

121
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,970
<3-4,Leonard>咱们得先对伯班克发动攻击啊
<3-4,Leonard>we need to launch a preemptive strike on Burbank.

122
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,180
<3-5,Sheldon>先下手为强 后下手遭殃嘛
<3-5,Sheldon>Get them before they get us.

123
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,950
<3-6,Raj (Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer)>看看是谁大驾光临了
<3-6,Raj (Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer)>Hey, look who decided to show up.

124
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,020
<3-7,Leonard>拉杰  你搞什么
<3-7,Leonard>Raj, what are you doing?

125
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,190
<3-8,Raj>我找不到你们  就买了六个新朋友
<3-8,Raj>I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends.

126
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,600
<3-8,Raj>可惜的是  有三个已经阵亡了
<3-8,Raj>Three, sadly, are dead.

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,070
<3-9,Sheldon>妈妈  你记得拉杰吗
<3-9,Sheldon>Mom, you remember Rajesh?

128
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,640
<3-9,Sheldon>-拉杰  这位是我妈妈  -当然记得  库珀夫人嘛
<3-9,Sheldon>- Rajesh, my mother. - Of course.Mrs. Cooper.

129
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,370
<3-10,Raj>很高兴再见到你
<3-10,Raj>So nice to see you again.

130
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,770
<3-11,Mrs Cooper>我也是
<3-11,Mrs Cooper>Well, it's so nice to see you, too.

132
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,140
<3-11,Mrs Cooper>我以为印第安人才偶有酗酒问题
<3-11,Mrs Cooper>I thought it was our Indians

133
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,310
<3-11,Mrs Cooper>没想到印度人也会呀
<3-11,Mrs Cooper>that had the occasional alcohol problem.

134
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,550
<3-12,Leonard>这也带歧视  不能说
<3-12,Leonard>We don't say that, either.

135
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,760
<3-12,Leonard>我回头列个单子给你
<3-12,Leonard>I'll make you a list.

136
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,420
<3-13,Mrs Cooper>你真是太好了  不愧是白人
<3-13,Mrs Cooper>Oh, that would be mighty white of you.

137
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,260
<3-13,Mrs Cooper>拉杰  你借酒浇愁
<3-13,Mrs Cooper>So, Raj, what pain are you trying

138
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,270
<3-13,Mrs Cooper>是为了什么事
<3-13,Mrs Cooper>to cover up with alcohol?

139
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,570
<3-14,Raj>没什么  我很好
<3-14,Raj>Nothing, I'm fine.

140
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,800
<3-15,Mrs Cooper>-是吗  -不  我不好
<3-15,Mrs Cooper>- Are ya? - No.

141
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
<3-17,Mrs Cooper>这样好多了
<3-17,Mrs Cooper>That's better.

142
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,140
<3-17,Mrs Cooper>说说你有什么困扰
<3-17,Mrs Cooper>Now tell me what's bothering you.

143
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,240
<3-18,Raj>我好孤独
<3-18,Raj>I'm so lonely.

144
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,840
<3-19,Sheldon>当然了  孤单的出生 孤独的死去
<3-19,Sheldon>Oh, yes, born alone, die alone.

145
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,880
<3-19,Sheldon>人类就是如此悲剧
<3-19,Sheldon>It's a tragic human condition.

146
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,180
<3-19,Sheldon>拉杰
<3-19,Sheldon>Now, Raj,

147
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,450
<3-19,Sheldon>你快别烦我妈了
<3-19,Sheldon>if you'll excuse my mother,

148
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,350
<3-19,Sheldon>她要去给我做核桃派
<3-19,Sheldon>she's about to make a pecan pie

149
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,280
<3-19,Sheldon>要是好吃
<3-19,Sheldon>that'll be so good

150
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,420
<3-19,Sheldon>我就暂时不计较炸鸡的事
<3-19,Sheldon>I'll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.

151
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,460
<3-20,Mrs Cooper>谢尔顿  你朋友很伤心
<3-20,Mrs Cooper>Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'.

152
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,560
<3-20,Mrs Cooper>这个时候我们该怎么做
<3-20,Mrs Cooper>What do we do when someone's hurtin'?

153
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,530
<3-21,Sheldon>给他们倒一杯热饮
<3-21,Sheldon>Offer them a hot beverage.

154
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,030
<3-22,Mrs Cooper>而要是他们喝得跟个鬼似的
<3-22,Mrs Cooper>And when they're drunk as a skunk,

155
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,400
<3-22,Mrs Cooper>我们该给他们什么饮料
<3-22,Mrs Cooper>what beverage do we offer?

156
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,530
<3-23,Sheldon>咖啡
<3-23,Sheldon>Coffee.

157
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,830
<3-23,Sheldon>还得要怎样
<3-23,Sheldon>And what do we do it with?

158
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,380
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>现在你给我听好
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>Now you listen to me.

159
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,450
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>我知道你感觉自己注定是剩男
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>I know you feel like you can't find someone,

160
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,280
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>但每个问题都有解决方法
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>but there's a lock for every key.

161
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,780
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>以前有个在沃尔玛工作的女孩
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>Back home, there's a girl works at the Wal-Mart.

162
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,920
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>长得实在太高
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>Tall, tall girl.

163
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,020
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>她用钉耙就能把鹅从空中打下来了
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>Woman could hunt geese with a rake.

164
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,420
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>她觉得自己找不到男人
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>Thought she'd never find a man,

165
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,130
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>但有一天  谁知道呢
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>then one day, wouldn't ya know,

167
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,560
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>哈林篮球队的人来到镇上
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>Harlem Globetrotters come to town.

168
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,670
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>长话短说
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>Long story short,

169
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,870
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>现在这个女人和一个
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>today that woman travels the world

170
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,770
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>半职业篮球选手周游世界
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>with a semi-professional basketball player

171
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,940
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>还生了两个漂亮的混血宝宝
<3-24,Mrs Cooper>and two beautiful mixed-race babies.

172
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,250
<3-25,Raj>虽然因为你的口音问题我没怎么听懂
<3-25,Raj>I didn't get a lot of that because of your accent,

173
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,650
<3-25,Raj>但你的语气很抚慰人心
<3-25,Raj>but the general tone was soothing

174
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,250
<3-25,Raj>我感觉好多了
<3-25,Raj>and somehow I feel better.

175
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,390
<3-26,Sheldon>我吃不到核桃派了是吧
<3-26,Sheldon>I'm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?

176
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,560
<3-27,Leonard>你想来点奥利奥吗
<3-27,Leonard>You want some Oreos?

177
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
<3-28,Sheldon>-混合夹心的吗  -不是  普通的
<3-28,Sheldon>- Double Stuf? - No, regular.

178
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,830
<3-30,Sheldon>不错  真会在伤口上撒盐
<3-30,Sheldon>Nice. Kick a man when he's down.

179
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,000
<4-1,Sheldon>很高兴我们终于可以一起做点事情
<4-1,Sheldon>I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together,

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,870
<4-1,Sheldon>-就我们两个人  -当然
<4-1,Sheldon>- just the two of us.  - Sure.

181
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,000
<4-2,Mrs Cooper>出来度假还有衣服要洗  真是开心啊
<4-2,Mrs Cooper>One thing you really miss when you're on vacation is laundry.

182
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,370
<4-3,Sheldon>注意点  你松软剂放太多了
<4-3,Sheldon>Careful, you're using too much Downey.

183
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,440
<4-3,Sheldon>要是我衣服太柔软  我穿着会想睡觉的
<4-3,Sheldon>You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.

184
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,610
<4-4,Mrs Cooper>这让我想起了以前的日子
<4-4,Mrs Cooper>Well, this takes me back.

185
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,610
<4-4,Mrs Cooper>我帮你洗衣服  而你在旁边碎碎念
<4-4,Mrs Cooper>Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.

186
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,620
<4-5,Sheldon>很有爱吧
<4-5,Sheldon>It is nice, isn't it?

187
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,310
<4-6,Penny (arriving)>库珀夫人
<4-6,Penny (arriving)>Mrs. Cooper.

188
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,510
<4-7,Mrs Cooper>你好  亲爱的
<4-7,Mrs Cooper>Oh, hello, darlin'.

189
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,860
<4-8,Penny>谢尔顿  你都没告诉我你妈妈要来
<4-8,Penny>Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming.

190
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,560
<4-9,Sheldon>我在一周邮件集锦中写了的
<4-9,Sheldon>It was in my weekly e-mail blast.

191
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,300
<4-9,Sheldon>就在"甜菜季终于来了"
<4-9,Sheldon>Right between "Beet season is finally here"

192
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,830
<4-9,Sheldon>和"神马  甜菜根会致癌"这两条中间
<4-9,Sheldon>and "Uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."

193
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,610
<4-10,Mrs Cooper>你最近怎么样
<4-10,Mrs Cooper>So, how've you been?

194
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,740
<4-11,Penny>很好啊
<4-11,Penny>Good, good.

195
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,340
<4-12,Mrs Cooper>我听说莱纳德交了新女友
<4-12,Mrs Cooper>I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend.

196
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,880
<4-12,Mrs Cooper>你感觉怎么样
<4-12,Mrs Cooper>How are you doing with all that?

197
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
<4-13,Penny>还好啦  已经过了一阵了
<4-13,Penny>Oh, fine. You know, it's been a while.

198
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,610
<4-13,Penny>我已经重新开始物色对象了
<4-13,Penny>I'm getting back out there.

199
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,880
<4-14,Mrs Cooper>我多嘴问一句  你物色对象的时候
<4-14,Mrs Cooper>Let me ask you, when you get back out there,

200
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,480
<4-14,Mrs Cooper>不会是穿着这个吧
<4-14,Mrs Cooper>are you wearing this?

201
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,920
<4-15,Penny>这个吊带超好看的
<4-15,Penny>Well, it's super cute on.

202
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,790
<4-15,Penny>全靠它别人才免费请我喝酒
<4-15,Penny>That top has paid for itself in free drinks

203
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,390
<4-15,Penny>省下的酒钱都够买十件了
<4-15,Penny>like ten times what it cost.

204
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,260
<4-16,Sheldon>对  佩妮的钱基本都是靠滥交来的
<4-16,Sheldon>Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.

205
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,870
<4-17,Mrs Cooper>亲爱的  你也许该知道
<4-17,Mrs Cooper>Hon, you think maybe the reason

206
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,900
<4-17,Mrs Cooper>你一直找不到一个合适的人
<4-17,Mrs Cooper>why you're having trouble finding a guy to settle down with

207
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,110
<4-17,Mrs Cooper>是因为你总让男人们先"上"车
<4-17,Mrs Cooper>is because you're letting them ride the roller coaster

208
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,310
<4-17,Mrs Cooper>而不让他们掏一个子儿
<4-17,Mrs Cooper>without buying a ticket?

209
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,350
<4-18,Penny>不是谁都有福分能"上"云霄飞车
<4-18,Penny>Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster.

210
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,220
<4-18,Penny>没福分的就只能在一旁  玩玩咖啡"杯"
<4-18,Penny>Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups.

211
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,350
<4-18,Penny>我今晚要出去
<4-18,Penny>Now I'm going out tonight.

212
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,760
<4-18,Penny>要是我请你帮我选衣服
<4-18,Penny>Would it be crazy to ask you

213
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,390
<4-18,Penny>这样会不会太疯狂了
<4-18,Penny>to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?

214
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,290
<4-19,Mrs Cooper>一点也不蠢
<4-19,Mrs Cooper>Oh, not crazy at all.

215
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,230
<4-19,Mrs Cooper>别看轻自己
<4-19,Mrs Cooper>And don't beat yourself up.

216
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,460
<4-19,Mrs Cooper>我像你这么大的时候
<4-19,Mrs Cooper>When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride

217
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,030
<4-19,Mrs Cooper>一瓶草莓酒就能骗我出去兜风了
<4-19,Mrs Cooper>and a bottle of strawberry wine.

218
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,340
<4-20,Sheldon>我可不会把这个写进本周邮件集锦里
<4-20,Sheldon>That will not be in this week's e-mail blast.

219
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,870
<5-1,Howard>今年春天
<5-1,Howard>So, this spring,

220
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,240
<5-1,Howard>我要出发去国际空间站
<5-1,Howard>I get to go to the International Space Station.

221
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,120
<5-2,Mrs Cooper>上帝啊  上天堂呀
<5-2,Mrs Cooper>Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens.

222
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,620
<5-2,Mrs Cooper>如果你想在那里定居
<5-2,Mrs Cooper>If you ever want to live there eternally,

223
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,890
<5-2,Mrs Cooper>我这有本好书你可以看看
<5-2,Mrs Cooper>I've got a good book you could read.

224
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,290
<5-3,Howard>心领了  不过我每年都看《查理·布朗的圣诞节》特辑
<5-3,Howard>Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year,

226
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,760
<5-3,Howard>所以也不会无聊
<5-3,Howard>so I get the gist.

227
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,600
<5-4,Mrs Cooper>-你妈妈肯定很以你为荣  -不
<5-4,Mrs Cooper>- I bet your mom is really proud of you. - Nope.

228
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,230
<5-5,Howard>她说如果我不退出
<5-5,Howard>She says if I don't back out

229
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,930
<5-5,Howard>她就要绝食抗议
<5-5,Howard>she's going to go on a hunger strike.

230
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,870
<5-5,Howard>虽然离出现生命危险
<5-5,Howard>It would take years before

231
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,900
<5-5,Howard>得有好几年时间  但我还是于心不忍
<5-5,Howard>she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.

232
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,940
<5-6,Sheldon>我们明天去好好玩一天  妈妈
<5-6,Sheldon>I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom.

233
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,240
<5-6,Sheldon>我要带你
<5-6,Sheldon>I'm taking you

235
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,980
<5-6,Sheldon>去看索尔·珀尔马特演讲
<5-6,Sheldon>to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture

236
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
<5-6,Sheldon>他那赢得诺贝尔奖的宇宙学研究成果
<5-6,Sheldon>about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology.

237
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,310
<5-6,Sheldon>但最精彩的部分是
<5-6,Sheldon>And the best part is,

238
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
<5-6,Sheldon>在后面的问答阶段
<5-6,Sheldon>at the Q and A afterward,

239
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,850
<5-6,Sheldon>我准备了几个问题
<5-6,Sheldon>I've worked up a couple of "Q's"

240
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,520
<5-6,Sheldon>绝对能把他问哭
<5-6,Sheldon>that will stump his sorry "A."

241
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,090
<5-7,Mrs Cooper>我不确定  谢利
<5-7,Mrs Cooper>I don't know, Shelly.

242
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,460
<5-7,Mrs Cooper>我觉得我们可以去观观光
<5-7,Mrs Cooper>I thought we could do a little sightseeing.

243
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,930

<5-8,Sheldon>embarrassing a Nobel laureate?

245
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,570
<5-9,Mrs Cooper>别这样  谢尔顿  我们可以带你妈
<5-9,Mrs Cooper>Come on, Sheldon, we'll take your mom

<5-10,Penny>Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.

249
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,070
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>一万二的手袋  我可买不起
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>Well, I can't spend $12,000 on a handbag,

250
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,940
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>但用正义的眼光谴责那些
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>but it's free to look upon those

251
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,510
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>买得起的人  这倒是不用花钱的
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>who do with righteous condemnation.

252
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,680
<5-12,Howard>你觉得怎么样
<5-12,Howard>What do you say?

253
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,850
<5-13,Sheldon>我觉得怎么样
<5-13,Sheldon>What do I say?

254
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,590
<5-13,Sheldon>我真心觉得我妈来探望我  关你们屁事
<5-13,Sheldon>I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,060
<5-13,Sheldon>你们收手吧
<5-13,Sheldon>Stop it.

258
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,500
<5-14,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>他不是说你  你的衣服密不透风
<5-14,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>He's not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.

259
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,910
<6-1,Leonard>这真是美味啊
<6-1,Leonard>These are delicious.

260
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,210
<6-2,Mrs Cooper>煎薄饼的秘诀就是用培根油
<6-2,Mrs Cooper>The trick to pancakes is bacon grease.

261
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,520
<6-2,Mrs Cooper>我做什么都放这油
<6-2,Mrs Cooper>I cook everything in it.

262
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,350
<6-3,Leonard>每样都放吗  你不怕有害健康吗
<6-3,Leonard>Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?

263
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,720
<6-4,Mrs Cooper>医生说话一向自相矛盾的
<6-4,Mrs Cooper>Oh, doctors are always changing their mind.

264
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,420
<6-4,Mrs Cooper>这个星期说你不能吃培根油
<6-4,Mrs Cooper>One week bacon grease is bad for you.

265
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,090
<6-4,Mrs Cooper>下个星期就说你吃得不够多
<6-4,Mrs Cooper>The next week we're not getting enough of it.

266
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,560
<6-4,Mrs Cooper>早上好  谢利
<6-4,Mrs Cooper>Good morning, Shelly.

267
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,530
<6-5,Sheldon>妈妈  我要为我昨晚的行为道歉
<6-5,Sheldon>Mom, I want to apologize for my behavior last night.

268
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,300
<6-6,Mrs Cooper>-接受你的道歉  -太好了
<6-6,Mrs Cooper>- Apology accepted.  - Great.

269
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,840
<6-7,Sheldon>你会喜欢珀尔马特的演讲的
<6-7,Sheldon>Now, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture.

270
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,910
<6-7,Sheldon>他会说宇宙现在已有六千多年历史
<6-7,Sheldon>Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years,

271
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,180
<6-7,Sheldon>我觉得这时你可以用手指塞住耳朵
<6-7,Sheldon>but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears

272
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,950
<6-7,Sheldon>然后低声哼唱《奇异恩典》[基督教圣诗]
<6-7,Sheldon>and hum "Amazing Grace" during those parts.

273
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,680
<6-8,Mrs Cooper>我还是要跟你朋友出去
<6-8,Mrs Cooper>I am still going out with your friends.

274
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,920
<6-9,Sheldon>可我已经道歉了
<6-9,Sheldon>But I apologized.

275
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,560
<6-9,Sheldon>我容易吗我  我又没做错什么
<6-9,Sheldon>And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong.

276
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,390
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>谢利  从小到大  那些枯燥无味的演讲
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls

277
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,700
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>我已经陪你听得够多了
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>while you were growing up.

278
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,560
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>我现在要去观光
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>I want to go sightseeing.

279
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,000
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>你何不吃点煎薄饼
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>So why don't you have some pancakes,

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,630
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>穿好衣服  跟我们一起去
<6-10,Mrs Cooper>get dressed and come with us.

281
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,770
<6-11,Sheldon>我不去  你不能逼我
<6-11,Sheldon>I'm not going, and you can't make me.

282
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,640
<6-12,Mrs Cooper>你说得对  我不能逼你  你自个儿玩得开心点
<6-12,Mrs Cooper>You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.

283
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,410
<6-13,Sheldon>那我就一直站在这里  直到你回心转意
<6-13,Sheldon>Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.

284
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,680
<6-14,Mrs Cooper>那你就在那儿站一天吧
<6-14,Mrs Cooper>Well, then you are going to stand there all day.

285
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,550
<6-15,Leonard>我还是带上我的培根油闪一边去吧
<6-15,Leonard>I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.

286
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,620
<6-16,Sheldon>真没想到  我妈妈居然要抛弃我
<6-16,Sheldon>I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me.

287
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,890
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>我没有要抛弃你
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>I am not abandoning you.

288
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,090
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>谢尔顿  要抛弃你  我早把你放篮子里
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket

289
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,460
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>扔教堂门口了
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>on a church doorstep.

290
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,130
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>我要去好莱坞  对着里根总统的蜡像说
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan

291
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,440
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>感谢他对国家做的贡献
<6-17,Mrs Cooper>for his service to our country.

292
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,170
<6-18,Sheldon>看来我们的母子关系处在十字路口了  妈妈
<6-18,Sheldon>We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.

293
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,810
<6-19,Mrs Cooper>看来如此
<6-19,Mrs Cooper>Well, I guess we are.

294
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,880
<6-20,Leonard>不好意思  忘了拿糖浆
<6-20,Leonard>Sorry. Syrup.

295
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,350
<6-21,Sheldon>好吧  妈妈
<6-21,Sheldon>All right, Mom.

296
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,320
<6-21,Sheldon>等你进到"瑞普利信不信由你"博物馆
<6-21,Sheldon>When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum,

298
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,720
<6-21,Sheldon>如果那里有展出情愿扔掉大好机会
<6-21,Sheldon>if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance

299
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,890
<6-21,Sheldon>也不愿陪她的天才儿子玩一天的母亲
<6-21,Sheldon>to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son,

300
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,690
<6-21,Sheldon>你要相信  因为真有这种妈妈
<6-21,Sheldon>believe it, because it's true.

301
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,530
<6-22,Leonard>我还没...
<6-22,Leonard>I hadn't...

302
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,530
<7-1,Sheldon>听这场演讲真是浪费时间
<7-1,Sheldon>That lecture was a waste of time.

303
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,530
<7-1,Sheldon>我还穿尿布的时候
<7-1,Sheldon>I made more accurate diagrams

304
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,070
<7-1,Sheldon>用尿布里的物体  在幼儿园墙上画的
<7-1,Sheldon>of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall

305
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,070
<7-1,Sheldon>早期宇宙膨胀图都比他的准
<7-1,Sheldon>with the contents of my diaper.

306
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,680
<7-2,Amy>你是不是病了
<7-2,Amy>Are you getting sick?

307
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,040
<7-3,Sheldon>不是  只是对那些
<7-3,Sheldon>No, I'm just allergic to people

308
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,880
<7-3,Sheldon>平白无故就得诺贝尔奖的人过敏
<7-3,Sheldon>who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.

309
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,980
<7-4,Amy>谢尔顿  你心情不好
<7-4,Amy>Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood--

310
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,690
<7-5,Sheldon>或者用临床术语说  嘴贱
<7-5,Sheldon>or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness--

311
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,120
<7-4,Amy>是因为你妈妈没有把你放在第一位
<7-4,Amy>is because your mother isn't making you a priority?

312
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,100
<7-5,Sheldon>不是  或者用临床术语说  我呸
<7-5,Sheldon>No. Or to use the clinical term, "nuh-uh""

313
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,130
<7-6,Amy>你确定吗  母婴配对关系
<7-6,Amy>Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond

314
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,470
<7-6,Amy>是灵长类动物心理的基础
<7-6,Amy>is the building block of primate psychology.

315
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,630
<7-7,Sheldon>又来了
<7-7,Sheldon>Oh, there it is.

316
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
<7-7,Sheldon>什么东西到你嘴里都绕回猴子身上
<7-7,Sheldon>It always comes back to monkeys with you.

317
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,570
<7-7,Sheldon>除了猴子  还是猴子
<7-7,Sheldon>Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.

318
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,940
<7-8,Amy>谢尔顿  人类也是动物
<7-8,Amy>Sheldon, we're all animals.

319
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,480
<7-8,Amy>虽然你有一些过人之处
<7-8,Amy>And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary,

320
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,850
<7-8,Amy>但说到情绪和人际关系
<7-8,Amy>but when it comes to emotions and relationships,

321
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,250
<7-8,Amy>你跟普通人没什么两样
<7-8,Amy>you're just like everybody else.

322
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,350
<7-9,Sheldon>你是说我的情绪问题
<7-9,Sheldon>Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems

323
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,790
<7-9,Sheldon>跟那些白痴没什么两样吗
<7-9,Sheldon>are no different than those of a stupid person?

324
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,120
<7-10,Amy>实际上  有些研究表明
<7-10,Amy>Actually, some research indicates

325
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,460
<7-10,Amy>不过分考虑的话
<7-10,Amy>that by not overthinking,

326
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,590
<7-10,Amy>智商较低的人  情绪控制得更好
<7-10,Amy>the less intelligent handle emotions better.

327
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,170
<7-10,Amy>你确定你不是感冒了吗
<7-10,Amy>Sure you're not coming down with a cold?

328
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,230
<7-11,Sheldon>是啊是啊  就跟其他人一样
<7-11,Sheldon>Oh, yes, the common cold.

329
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,400
<7-11,Sheldon>得那种普通的感冒呀
<7-11,Sheldon>Just like everyone else.

330
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,640
<7-11,Sheldon>那样你就爽了  对吧
<7-11,Sheldon>You'd love that, wouldn't you?

331
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,010
<8-1,Mrs Cooper>这间挺漂亮的嘛
<8-1,Mrs Cooper>Oh, this one's sweet.

332
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,750
<8-1,Mrs Cooper>对你们这种拿着念珠念经的人来说不错了
<8-1,Mrs Cooper>You know, for your rosary rattlers.

334
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,950
<8-2,Leonard>库珀太太  那些是天主教徒  不是"拿着念珠念经的人"
<8-2,Leonard>Mrs. Cooper, we say "Catholics" not "rosary rattlers".

335
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,240
<8-3,Mrs Cooper>上帝啊  加利福尼亚怎么这么多条条框框
<8-3,Mrs Cooper>My goodness, it's a wonder you people in California

336
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,450
<8-3,Mrs Cooper>还让不让人讲话了
<8-3,Mrs Cooper>can talk at all.

337
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,690
<8-4,Penny>这真是史上最烂的好莱坞之旅了
<8-4,Penny>This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.

338
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,760
<8-5,Leonard>咱有什么办法  谁叫她非要逛教堂呢
<8-5,Leonard>What are we gonna do? She wanted to see churches.

339
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,500
<8-6,Penny>教堂里有酒的  对吧
<8-6,Penny>Hey, they have wine here, don't they?

<8-7,Raj (pointing at a crucifixion statue)>我们印度的神可没有这么强壮的腹肌
<8-7,Raj (pointing at a crucifixion statue)>None of our gods have abs like that.

<8-8,Howard>没错  这是最后一个坚持做仰卧起坐的犹太人
<8-8,Howard>Yep, that's the last Jew who did sit-ups.

00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,310
<8-8,Howard>可你看看他的下场
<8-8,Howard>And look where it got him.

<8-9,Mrs Cooper>给这个教堂也添点教堂的气氛嘛
<8-9,Mrs Cooper>Let's put a little church in this church.

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,420
<8-10,Leonard>我觉得我们不...
<8-10,Leonard>Oh, I'm not sure we should...

346

<8-12,Penny>您要是能阻止我哥造冰毒的话
<8-12,Penny>it would be a big help to my family

360
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,850
<8-12,Penny>那就是帮了我们家大忙了
<8-12,Penny>if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth.

361
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,190
<8-12,Penny>但是别惊动警察  私下解决就好
<8-12,Penny>But no cops. Be cool.

362
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,290
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>她还有点太爱她的邻居了
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>She also goes a little overboard

363
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,630
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>都爱上床了
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>on the "love thy neighbor" .

364
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,160
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>或许可以像解救抹大拉的玛丽亚那样帮帮她
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene.

366
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,570
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>莱纳德  到你了
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>Leonard, you're up.

367
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,530
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>那个叫沃什么的  你做好准备
<8-13,Mrs Cooper>Wasserman, you're on deck.

368
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,840
<8-14,Leonard>好吧  说啥呢
<8-14,Leonard>Okay. I don't know...

369
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,310
<8-14,Leonard>现在再求你让我长高点  可能有点太晚了
<8-14,Leonard>it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller.

370
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,510
<8-14,Leonard>对了  也许你可以帮帮我和我的女朋友
<8-14,Leonard>Oh, um...if you could help out with me and my girlfriend.

371
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,650
<8-14,Leonard>她现在远在印度  你要是能帮我们一下就好了
<8-14,Leonard>She's all the way in India. That would be great.

372
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,020
<8-15,Mrs Cooper>听见没  恋情烦恼
<8-15,Mrs Cooper>Hear that? Girl trouble.

373
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,990
<8-15,Mrs Cooper>看来我们都没想到莱纳德也能交上女朋友
<8-15,Mrs Cooper>Turns out we were both wrong on that front.

374
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,190
<8-15,Mrs Cooper>-你呢  -我
<8-15,Mrs Cooper>- How about you?  - Oh, me?

375
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,560
<8-16,Howard>不用了  我没啥愿望
<8-16,Howard>No. Thanks, I'm good.

376
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,230
<8-16,Howard>我只盼着宇宙飞船别突然爆炸就行
<8-16,Howard>I'm really just trying not to burst into flames.

377
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,370
<8-17,Mrs Cooper>拉杰呢
<8-17,Mrs Cooper>Rajesh?

378
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,810
<8-18,Howard>他说他那最后的五磅体重
<8-18,Howard>He says he's having trouble

379
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,940
<8-18,Howard>怎么都减不下去
<8-18,Howard>dropping those last five pounds.

380
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,140
<8-19,Mrs Cooper>要是我就求主解决  我不敢跟女孩子讲话的问题
<8-19,Mrs Cooper>Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.

381
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,350
<8-20,Howard>不行  你一次只能许一个愿
<8-20,Howard>No, you only get one wish.

383
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,170
<8-20,Howard>看看咱俩
<8-20,Howard>Look at the two of us.

384
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,200
<9-1,Sheldon>我  一位受人尊敬的物理学家
<9-1,Sheldon>Me, a highly regarded physicist.

385
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,340
<9-1,Sheldon>一两代人里才偶然出现一个的
<9-1,Sheldon>The kind of mind that comes along once,

386
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,380
<9-1,Sheldon>超级高智商
<9-1,Sheldon>maybe twice in a generation.

387
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,880
<9-1,Sheldon>你呢  就是个普通人
<9-1,Sheldon>You, the common man,

388
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,520
<9-1,Sheldon>股票经纪  要不就是吸尘机销售员
<9-1,Sheldon>tired from your labors as a stockbroker,

389
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,520
<9-1,Sheldon>再不然就是个擦皮鞋的  累得半死刚下班
<9-1,Sheldon>or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack.

390
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,860
<9-1,Sheldon>但是内心深处
<9-1,Sheldon>But deep down inside...

391
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,430
<9-1,Sheldon>咱俩也就是一丘之貉
<9-1,Sheldon>apparently we're just two peas in a pod.

392
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,600
<9-1,Sheldon>只不过你是个普通的貉
<9-1,Sheldon>A regular pea,

393
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
<9-1,Sheldon>而我是个一两代才出那么一个的
<9-1,Sheldon>and the kind of pea that comes along once,

394
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,430
<9-1,Sheldon>高等貉
<9-1,Sheldon>maybe twice in a generation.

395
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,970
<9-1,Sheldon>下雨了
<9-1,Sheldon>Rain.

396
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,480
<9-1,Sheldon>又一个象征着众人平等的标志
<9-1,Sheldon>Another great equalizer.

397
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,310
<9-1,Sheldon>雨浇在我这个天才头上
<9-1,Sheldon>Falling on the head of the brilliant

398
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,310
<9-1,Sheldon>也浇在你这个凡人头上
<9-1,Sheldon>and the unremarkable alike.

399
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,860
<9-1,Sheldon>真有先见之明
<9-1,Sheldon>Smarty-pants.

400
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,490
<10-1,Penny>库珀太太  你做的饭太香了
<10-1,Penny>Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.

401
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,830
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>记着我的话  亲爱的
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>You take notes, darlin'.

402
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,160
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>拴住一个男人真正的秘诀就是给他做
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>The real way to get a man is with melted cheese

403
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,030
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>融化的奶酪和奶油蘑菇汤
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>and cream of mushroom soup.

404
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,500
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>虽然他五十岁就挂掉  但在那之前绝对会全心爱你
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>He'll die at 50 but his love will be true.

405
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,410
<10-3,Sheldon (entering, soaked)>给我张纸巾  这张湿了
<10-3,Sheldon (entering, soaked)>I need a tissue. This one got wet.

406
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,950
<10-4,Leonard>给你
<10-4,Leonard>Here.

407
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,450
<10-5,Sheldon>谢谢  我今天学到东西了
<10-5,Sheldon>Thank you. Yeah, I've learned something today.

408
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,360
<10-5,Sheldon>你和我  在很多方面
<10-5,Sheldon>You and I, in so many ways,

409
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,830
<10-5,Sheldon>除了智商和其他重要方面
<10-5,Sheldon>other than intelligence and what counts,

410
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,630
<10-5,Sheldon>其实没什么不同
<10-5,Sheldon>we're the same

411
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,200
<10-6,Mrs Cooper>-亲爱的  你生病了吗  -但愿如此
<10-6,Mrs Cooper>- Sweetheart, are you sick? - I hope so.

412
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,470
<10-7,Sheldon>如果这都不叫生病  那活着还有什么意义
<10-7,Sheldon>because if this is well, life isn't worth living.

413
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,770
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>宝贝儿  你发烧了
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up.

414
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,010
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>-赶快上床躺着去吧  -好吧
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>- We've got to get you to bed.  - Okay.

415
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,470
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>别担心  妈妈来照顾小宝贝儿
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>Don't worry. Mama's here to take care of her baby.

416
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,510
<10-11,Sheldon>咱先说清楚  你只照顾自己的宝贝儿
<10-11,Sheldon>And just to be clear, only her baby

417
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,810
<10-11,Sheldon>而不是所有这些宝贝儿对吧
<10-11,Sheldon>and not these other people.

418
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
<10-12,Mrs Cooper>那当然
<10-12,Mrs Cooper>Of course.

419
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,450
<10-13,Sheldon>我想喝蜂蜜茶
<10-13,Sheldon>Can I have tea with honey

420
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,150
<10-13,Sheldon>吃去边的三明治  可以吗
<10-13,Sheldon>and toast with the crust cut off?

421
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,820
<10-14,Mrs Cooper>你想吃什么都行
<10-14,Mrs Cooper>You can have whatever you want.

422
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,560
<10-15,Sheldon>谢谢妈妈  你最好了
<10-15,Sheldon>Thanks, Mom. You're the best.

423
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,470
<11-1,Mrs Cooper>天啊  上次我帮你涂药膏的时候
<11-1,Mrs Cooper>Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you,

424
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,380
<11-1,Mrs Cooper>你还没长出胸毛来呢
<11-1,Mrs Cooper>you didn't have hair on your chest.

425
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,580
<11-2,Sheldon>是啊  去年才长出来的
<11-2,Sheldon>I know, it filled in last year.

426
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,650
<11-2,Sheldon>你这次来  我都没跟你在一起待多久
<11-2,Sheldon>I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.

427
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,650
<11-3,Mrs Cooper>这是谁的错啊
<11-3,Mrs Cooper>And whose fault was that?

428
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,620
<11-4,Sheldon>你的错
<11-4,Sheldon>Yours.

429
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,160
<11-5,Mrs Cooper>谢利  你已经不再是个八岁的小孩子了
<11-5,Mrs Cooper>Shelly, you're not eight years old anymore.

430
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,030
<11-5,Mrs Cooper>咱俩之间的关系不能跟以前一样了
<11-5,Mrs Cooper>We have to have a different relationship.

431
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,000
<11-6,Sheldon>不要
<11-6,Sheldon>No, we don't.

432
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,730
<11-6,Sheldon>咱俩之前那样就挺好的呀
<11-6,Sheldon>The one we have works great.

433
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,230
<11-7,Mrs Cooper>亲爱的  你是个大人了
<11-7,Mrs Cooper>Sweetheart, you are a grown man.

434
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,670
<11-8,Sheldon>没准我是个

435
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,570
<11-8,Sheldon>寿命长达上百年的新物种呢
<11-8,Sheldon>that lives for hundreds of years,

436
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,280
<11-8,Sheldon>也就是说我现在还是个两三岁的孩子呢
<11-8,Sheldon>which means I'm still basically a toddler.

437
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,240
<11-9,Mrs Cooper>我当年真应该带你去休斯顿
<11-9,Mrs Cooper>Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.

438
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,880
<11-10,Sheldon>也就是说你不会唱《乖乖猫》给我听了吗
<11-10,Sheldon>Does this mean you're not going to sing "Soft Kitty"?

439
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,500
<11-11,Mrs Cooper>不  我永远都会唱《乖乖猫》给你听的
<11-11,Mrs Cooper>No, I will always sing you "Soft Kitty".

440
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,870

442
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,570
<11-12,Leonard (at door)>库珀太太  我们是不是该把那个派
<11-12,Leonard (at door)>Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie

443
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,650
<11-12,Leonard (at door)>-从烤箱里拿出来了  -滚
<11-12,Leonard (at door)>- out of the oven? - Get out!

444
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
<11-14,Mrs Cooper>这也太没礼貌了
<11-14,Mrs Cooper>Well, that was rude.

445
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,220
<11-15,Sheldon>就是啊  不过他也不是故意的
<11-15,Sheldon>Well, I know, but he means well.

446
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,520
<11-15,Sheldon>继续唱吧
<11-15,Sheldon>Sing.

<11-17,Sheldon>你是想偷懒吗  妈
<11-17,Sheldon>What are you trying to pull, Mom?

449
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,360
<11-17,Sheldon>从头开始唱
<11-17,Sheldon>From the top.

450
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,830
<11-18,Mrs Cooper (to God)>我就说他欠揍嘛
<11-18,Mrs Cooper (to God)>This is what I'm talking about.
