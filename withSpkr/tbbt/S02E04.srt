00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
<1-1,Leonard>拉杰是宫保鸡丁
<1-1,Leonard>Let's see, Raj was the Kung Pao Chicken.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,960
<1-2,Penny>我是饺子
<1-2,Penny>I'm the dumplings.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,560
<1-3,Howard>没错

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,700
<1-4,Penny>太恶心了  霍华德
<1-4,Penny>Creepy, howard.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,500
<1-5,Howard>恶心得可爱还是纯粹的恶心
<1-5,Howard>Creepy good or creepy bad?

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,700
<1-6,Leonard>谁点的鲜虾加龙虾酱
<1-6,Leonard>Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,800
<1-7,Howard>那是我的
<1-7,Howard>That would be me.

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,860
<1-7,Howard>朝这里看  你这个肮脏的小美味
<1-7,Howard>Come to papa, you un-kosher delight.

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,530
<1-7,Howard>我这话可不光是对着食物说哦
<1-7,Howard>I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,660
<1-8,Penny>坐一边去
<1-8,Penny>Sit over there.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,860
<1-8,Penny>坐一边去
<1-8,Penny>Sit over there.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,660
<1-9,Sheldon (entering, to Penny who is in his spot)>婴儿纸巾
<1-9,Sheldon (entering, to Penny who is in his spot)>Baby wipe?

<1-11,Leonard and Howard together>-别问  -别  别问
<1-11,Leonard and Howard together>No, don't ask! no, don't, don't!

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,060
<1-12,Sheldon>我来告诉你为什么
<1-12,Sheldon>I'll tell you why.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,030
<1-14,Sheldon>我必须消毒我的手
<1-14,Sheldon>I had to sanitize my hands

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,130
<1-14,Sheldon>因为大学把 厕所里擦手的纸巾
<1-14,Sheldon>Because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,330
<1-14,Sheldon>换成了吹风机
<1-14,Sheldon>With hot air blowers.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,530
<1-15,Penny>我怎么感觉吹风机更卫生
<1-15,Penny>I thought the blowers were more sanitary.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,100
<1-16,Leonard and Howard>别问啊
<1-16,Leonard and Howard>Really, don't.  why...?

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,060
<1-17,Sheldon>吹风机可以说是细菌 和瘟疫的发源地
<1-17,Sheldon>Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

22
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,500
<1-17,Sheldon>老实说  用吹风机的话
<1-17,Sheldon>Frankly, it'd be more hygienic

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,830
<1-17,Sheldon>还不如让一只得了瘟疫的长臂猿打喷嚏打到我手干
<1-17,Sheldon>If they just had a plague-infested gibbon

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,200
<1-17,Sheldon>来得卫生呢
<1-17,Sheldon>Sneeze my hands dry.

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
<1-19,Penny>是不是永远都不能在我面前说话
<1-19,Penny>To talk in front of me without being drunk?

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,660
<1-19,Penny>好吧  那我 就自己一个人去吃了
<1-19,Penny>Okay, well, I'll just, um, go eat by myself.

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,130
<1-20,Leonard>佩妮  你不需要这样的
<1-20,Leonard>Penny, you don't have to do that.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,100
<1-21,Penny>没事  考虑到他不说话 他说的话  还有他
<1-21,Penny>Oh, it's okay, between him not talking, him talking and him...

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,900
<1-21,Penny>我最好还是离开吧
<1-21,Penny>I'm better off alone.

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,700
<1-21,Penny>再见  你这个可怜的怪人
<1-21,Penny>Good-bye, you poor, strange little man.

<1-24,Raj>还记得那个我定位的
<1-24,Raj>Remember that little planetary object

37
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,830
<1-24,Raj>比凯伯带天体更远的那颗行星吗
<1-24,Raj>I spotted beyond the kuiper belt?

69
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,800
<1-38,Sheldon>是不是由什么行业审查委员会
<1-38,Sheldon>Was there some sort of peer review committee

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,000
<1-38,Sheldon>来决定选那些人

76
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,300
<1-42,Sheldon>他们有什么凭据吗
<1-42,Sheldon>What are their credentials?

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,730
<1-42,Sheldon>为什么他们有资格评选
<1-42,Sheldon>How are they qualified?

78
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,400
<1-42,Sheldon>偶然发现了一块在太阳系里
<1-42,Sheldon>What makes accidentally  noticing a hunk of rock

<1-42,Sheldon>For billions of years more noteworthy

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,100
<1-42,Sheldon>30岁以下科学家的成就 更加杰出呢
<1-42,Sheldon>Than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under 30?

82
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,860
<1-43,Raj>天呐  我想爱伦·佩基的朋友们 不会这样损她的
<1-43,Raj>Boy, I'll bet ellen page's friends aren't giving her this kind of crap.

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,600
<1-44,Leonard>这下你感到自豪了吗
<1-44,Leonard>Are you proud of yourself?

84
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,930
<1-45,Sheldon>总的来说  是的
<1-45,Sheldon>In general, yes.

<1-45,Sheldon>哦  漏掉的中微子原来在这儿
<1-45,Sheldon>Oh, there's my missing neutrino.

86
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,400
<2-1,Sheldon>你就像一个不稳定的电荷一样躲躲藏藏的
<2-1,Sheldon>You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge,

87
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,300
<2-1,Sheldon>是吗  你这个亚原子魔鬼
<2-1,Sheldon>Weren't you, you little sub-atomic dickens?

88
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,660
<2-2,Leonard (entering with Howard)>谢尔顿
<2-2,Leonard (entering with Howard)>Hey, sheldon.

89
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,860
<2-2,Leonard (entering with Howard)>看啊
<2-2,Leonard (entering with Howard)>Hey, look,

90
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,160
<2-3,Sheldon>我找到了那个中微子
<2-3,Sheldon>Look, I found  my missing neutrino.

91
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,860
<2-4,Howard>太好了  我们可以把他从牛奶盒上拿下来了
<2-4,Howard>Oh good, we can take it off the milk carton.

92
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,800
<2-5,Leonard>走吧  我们去和拉杰道歉
<2-5,Leonard>Come on, we're going to apologize to raj

93
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,900
<2-5,Leonard>请他去吃晚饭
<2-5,Leonard>And invite him out to dinner.

94
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,900
<2-6,Sheldon>道什么歉
<2-6,Sheldon>Apologize for what?

95
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,360
<2-7,Leonard>他昨天带了一个好消息来
<2-7,Leonard>He came over last night with some pretty good news

96
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,260
<2-7,Leonard>但我们都很不热情
<2-7,Leonard>And we weren't very supportive.

97
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,860
<2-8,Sheldon>我感觉你像是要说什么
<2-8,Sheldon>I sense you're trying  to tell me something.

98
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,930
<2-9,Howard>你昨天相当欠扁
<2-9,Howard>You were a colossal asshat.

99
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,300
<2-10,Sheldon>没有吧
<2-10,Sheldon>No, I beg to differ.

100
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,930
<2-10,Sheldon>在我们3个人之间  我是最热情的一个
<2-10,Sheldon>Of the three of us, I was by far  the most supportive.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,760
<2-11,Leonard>是吗  来说说
<2-11,Leonard>Really? do tell.

102
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,900
<2-12,Sheldon>如果拉杰的朋友们把门槛降低的话
<2-12,Sheldon>How will raj ever reach true greatness

103
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,600
<2-12,Sheldon>他怎么能找到科学的真谛呢
<2-12,Sheldon>If his friends lower the bar for him?

104
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,430
<2-12,Sheldon>我11岁的时候
<2-12,Sheldon>When I was 11,

105
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,930
<2-12,Sheldon>我妹妹给我爸买了一个
<2-12,Sheldon>My sister bought our father

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
<2-12,Sheldon>写着"世界上最好的爸爸"字样的咖啡杯
<2-12,Sheldon>A "world's greatest dad" coffee mug

107
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,160
<2-12,Sheldon>老实说  他一生就这么晃荡下去了
<2-12,Sheldon>And, frankly, the man coasted until the day he died.

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,730
<2-13,Leonard>那么这么说吧
<2-13,Leonard>Okay, let's try it this way.

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,960
<2-13,Leonard>如果这个什么《人物》杂志 是拉杰能得到的最高成就呢
<2-13,Leonard>What if this people magazine thing is the best raj is ever going to achieve?

110
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,160
<2-14,Sheldon>这我到没想到
<2-14,Sheldon>I had not considered that.

111
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,700
<2-15,Leonard>走吧
<2-15,Leonard>Come on.

112
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,730
<2-16,Sheldon>我总是忘了普通人是有极限的
<2-16,Sheldon>I often forget other people have limitations.

113
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,200
<2-16,Sheldon>真是悲哀
<2-16,Sheldon>It's so sad.

114
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,960
<2-17,Howard>他能感到悲哀
<2-17,Howard>He can feel sadness?

115
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,230
<2-18,Leonard>不太能
<2-18,Leonard>Not really.

116
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,360
<2-18,Leonard>我们管这个叫自以为是
<2-18,Leonard>It's what you and I would call condescension.

117
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,960
<3-1,Leonard>我们进去的时候 得让他觉得我们为他高兴
<3-1,Leonard>Now when we go in there, let's show raj that we're happy for him.

118

<3-25,Sheldon>You merely noticed he was here,

153
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,760
<3-25,Sheldon>就跟他也没怎么留意过2008-NQ SUB-17
<3-25,Sheldon>Much like he did with 2008-nq sub-17.

<3-44,Raj>我都不知道还有专门给院长的餐厅
<3-44,Raj>I didn't even know there was a president's dining room.

178
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,630

<4-3,Raj>我站在星空的背景前面 拍照  我摆了个这样的姿势
<4-3,Raj>They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.

190
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,900
<4-3,Raj>他们要PS一个超新星进去
<4-3,Raj>They're going to digitally add a supernova.

191
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,830
<4-3,Raj>他们觉得这样能完美诠释 我辉煌的天赋
<4-3,Raj>They say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.

192
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,360
<4-4,Sheldon>没错  就像一个炽热的大火球
<4-4,Sheldon>Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas

193
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,730
<4-4,Sheldon>分崩离析
<4-4,Sheldon>That collapses upon itself.

194

<4-6,Howard>我想要根笔 还得拿着剪线钳去银行
<4-6,Howard>If I want a new pen, i have to go to the bank with wire cutters.

199
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,860
<4-7,Sheldon (still smiling)>咱们已经尽到所有该尽的社会责任了吧
<4-7,Sheldon (still smiling)>Have we at this point met our social obligations?

<4-9,Raj>哦了么  我挂了
<4-9,Raj>All righty? koothrappali out.

<4-9,Raj>God bless that boy.

205
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,700
<4-9,Raj>没有他我非忙死不可
<4-9,Raj>I don't know what I'd do without him.

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,930
<4-10,Leonard>你今天下午才有的助理啊
<4-10,Leonard>You just got him this afternoon.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,300
<4-11,Raj>没错  但我觉得我是得有个仆人
<4-11,Raj>Yes, but I'm finding that having a lackey suits me.

208
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,930
<4-12,Leonard>仆人
<4-12,Leonard>A lackey?

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,660
<4-13,Raj>不好意思  是不是法律不允许啊
<4-13,Raj>Oh, I'm sorry. is that politically incorrect?

210
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,800
<4-13,Raj>在印度  我们称其为贱民
<4-13,Raj>In india, we just call them untouchables.

211
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,930
<4-14,Sheldon>现在
<4-14,Sheldon>Now?

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,100
<4-15,Leonard>快了
<4-15,Leonard>Almost.

213
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,660
<4-16,Raj>说到贱民  我给你们带来了好消息
<4-16,Raj>Speaking of untouchables, I've got great news for you guys.

<4-17,Howard>Oh, you're welcome.

218
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,960
<4-18,Raj>当然我没法让你们去贵宾席
<4-18,Raj>Of course, I couldn't get you into the vip section

219
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,430
<4-18,Raj>因为那是设给贵宾的
<4-18,Raj>Because, you know, that's for vips

220
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,760
<4-18,Raj>你们只是  普通人
<4-18,Raj>And you guys are just, you know... p's.

221
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,760
<4-19,Sheldon>在巴布亚新几内亚有一个部落
<4-19,Sheldon>There's a tribe in papua new guinea

222
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,030
<4-19,Sheldon>当一个猎人向其他部民
<4-19,Sheldon>Where, when a hunter flaunts his success

223
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,400
<4-19,Sheldon>炫耀他的成功时
<4-19,Sheldon>To the rest of the village,

224
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,760
<4-19,Sheldon>他们宰了他  并敲打他的皮做的鼓
<4-19,Sheldon>They kill him and drive away evil spirits

225
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,430
<4-19,Sheldon>以驱逐他邪恶的灵魂
<4-19,Sheldon>With a drum made of his skin.

226
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,530
<4-19,Sheldon>当然是迷信而无道理的
<4-19,Sheldon>Superstitious nonsense, of course,

227
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,830
<4-19,Sheldon>但某人可以明白他们的用意
<4-19,Sheldon>But one can see their point.

228

<4-21,Raj>那就周六晚上了  这么说定了
<4-21,Raj>Okay. so, saturday night, can I count on my posse?

334
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,390

335
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,890
<5-60,Sheldon>我八岁时
<5-60,Sheldon>When I was eight,

336
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,890

<5-64,Howard>好的  有一只叫阿吉的死猫  接着讲
<5-64,Howard>Okay, dead cat named lucky. continue.

341
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,420
<5-65,Sheldon>当其他人哀悼阿吉时  我想到的是它的提早离世
<5-65,Sheldon>While others mourned lucky, I realized his untimely demise

342

<5-65,Sheldon>给我提供了一个换掉他的机会

<5-65,Sheldon>A faithful companion

345
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,720
<5-65,Sheldon>这样我晚上睡觉时就能抱着它
<5-65,Sheldon>That I could snuggle with at night,

346
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,620
<5-65,Sheldon>而且还能阻止心灵捕手的杀害
<5-65,Sheldon>Yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.

347
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,520
<5-66,Howard>那你不想要小狗
<5-66,Howard>So not a puppy?

350
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,990
<5-68,Leonard>狮身鹰首兽吗
<5-68,Leonard>A griffin?

351
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,920
<5-69,Sheldon>对  一半是鹰  一半是狮子
<5-69,Sheldon>Yes, half eagle, half lion.

352
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,090
<5-70,Leonard>还是一半是神话
<5-70,Leonard>And mythological.

353
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,250
<5-71,Sheldon>毫不相关
<5-71,Sheldon>Irrelevant.

354
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,020
<5-71,Sheldon>我在研究DNA重组技术
<5-71,Sheldon>I was studying recombinant dna technology,

355
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,820
<5-71,Sheldon>我相信我能造出来一个
<5-71,Sheldon>And I was confidant I could create one,

356
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,320
<5-71,Sheldon>但我爸妈不愿意
<5-71,Sheldon>But my parents were unwilling

357
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,990
<5-71,Sheldon>找实验必须的老鹰的卵和狮子的精子
<5-71,Sheldon>To secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.

358
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,990
<5-71,Sheldon>当然了  当我妹妹想要时 她能在游泳课上得到
<5-71,Sheldon>Of course, my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.

359
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
<5-72,Howard>谢尔顿  不是我们不喜欢关于狮子精子的故事
<5-72,Howard>Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a good lion semen story,

360
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,190
<5-72,Howard>只是  你到底想说什么
<5-72,Howard>But... what's your point?

361
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,290
<5-73,Sheldon>我想说的是如果库萨帕里得到了
<5-73,Sheldon>My point is if koothrappali is moving on

362
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,890
<5-73,Sheldon>不应该属于他的名誉而过上了新生活
<5-73,Sheldon>To a new life of shallow undeserved fame,

363
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,620
<5-73,Sheldon>也许是时候造一个更好的同伴了
<5-73,Sheldon>Perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.

364
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,050
<5-74,Leonard>你还想培植一个新朋友
<5-74,Leonard>You want to breed a new friend?

365
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,920
<5-75,Sheldon>是个选择  不过谁有那闲工夫
<5-75,Sheldon>That's one option,  but who has the time?

366
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,650
<5-75,Sheldon>不过想想这个  日本人
<5-75,Sheldon>But consider this-- the japanese,

367
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,750
<5-75,Sheldon>他们正在做一些关于
<5-75,Sheldon>They're doing some wonderful work

368
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,050
<5-75,Sheldon>人工智能的研究
<5-75,Sheldon>With artificial intelligence.

369
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,220
<5-75,Sheldon>现在  你把这项研究和来自迪斯尼
<5-75,Sheldon>Now, you combine that with some animatronics

370
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,220
<5-75,Sheldon>幻想者的那些电子动物们结合
<5-75,Sheldon>From the imagineers over at disney,

371
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,990
<5-75,Sheldon>咱们就能和通晓多国语言的
<5-75,Sheldon>Next thing you know, we're playing halo

372
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,220
<5-75,Sheldon>亚伯拉罕·林肯玩《光环》了[视频游戏]
<5-75,Sheldon>With a multilingual abraham lincoln.

373
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,990
<5-76,Howard>谢尔顿  别会错意了  不过你真是疯了
<5-76,Howard>Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way, but you're insane.

374
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,850
<5-77,Leonard>可能像你说的那样吧
<5-77,Leonard>That may well be,

375
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,690
<5-77,Leonard>不过事实是结识新人
<5-77,Leonard>But the fact is it wouldn't kill us

376
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,190
<5-77,Leonard>它也不会杀了我们
<5-77,Leonard>To meet some new people.

377
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,090
<5-78,Sheldon>我正式声明  它可能会因结识新人而杀了我们
<5-78,Sheldon>For the record, it could kill us to meet new people.

378
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,190
<5-78,Sheldon>他们可能是杀人凶手  或者未知病原体的携带者
<5-78,Sheldon>They could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

379
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,090
<5-78,Sheldon>而且我没疯  我妈带我做过检查了
<5-78,Sheldon>And I'm not insane. my mother had me tested.

380
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,120
<5-79,Leonard>如果我们真有了个新朋友
<5-79,Leonard>If we do get a new friend,

381
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,950
<5-79,Leonard>他应该是一个我们信得过的人
<5-79,Leonard>He should be a guy you can trust.

382
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,920
<5-79,Leonard>他应该支持你
<5-79,Leonard>A guy who has your back.

383
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,520
<5-82,Howard>而且他应该有很多钱

<5-80,Howard>我们可以在那举办聚会
<5-80,Howard>Where we could throw parties.

386
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,890
<5-81,Sheldon>他应该像我们那样热爱科技
<5-81,Sheldon>He should share our love of technology.

387
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,250
<5-82,Howard>他还应该认识很多的女人
<5-82,Howard>And he should know a lot of women.

388
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,050
<5-83,Leonard>那就是说  钱  女人  科技
<5-83,Leonard>Let's see, money, women, technology.
