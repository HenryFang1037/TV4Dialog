8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
<1-1,Leonard>谢天谢地  到家了
<1-1,Leonard>Oh, thank God we're home.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,640
<1-2,Howard>难以置信我们在那冰冷的地狱呆了3个月
<1-2,Howard>I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,150
<1-3,Raj>简直就是个噩梦
<1-3,Raj>It was like a snowy nightmare

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,100
<1-3,Raj>梦里漫天飞雪  而又无法醒来
<1-3,Raj>from which there was no awakening.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,000
<1-4,Sheldon>我不知道你们对北极考察的感想
<1-4,Sheldon>I don't know what Arctic expedition you guys were on,

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,110
<1-4,Sheldon>我只觉得意犹未尽
<1-4,Sheldon>but I thought it was a hoot and a half.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,050
<1-4,Sheldon>你好  妈妈
<1-4,Sheldon>Oh, hi, Mom.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,220
<2-1,Sheldon>不  我说了  到家了再打电话给你
<2-1,Sheldon>No, I told you I'd call you when I got home.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,400
<2-1,Sheldon>我还没到家呢
<2-1,Sheldon>I'm not home yet.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,580
<2-1,Sheldon>行了  到家了
<2-1,Sheldon>All right, I'm home.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,400
<2-1,Sheldon>北极考察非常成功
<2-1,Sheldon>The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success.

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,860
<2-1,Sheldon>说不定我将来能得一个诺贝尔奖
<2-1,Sheldon>I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize in my future.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,180
<2-1,Sheldon>其实  不应该这样说
<2-1,Sheldon>Actually, I shouldn't say that.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,950
<2-1,Sheldon>我完全确定能得
<2-1,Sheldon>I'm entirely certain.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,170
<2-1,Sheldon>不  妈妈  我感觉不到
<2-1,Sheldon>No, Mother, I could not feel

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,580
<2-1,Sheldon>你的教会小组为我祈祷平安
<2-1,Sheldon>your church group praying for my safty.

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,400
<2-1,Sheldon>就算我平安回家也不证明祈祷有效
<2-1,Sheldon>The fact that I'm home safe does not prove that it worked.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,280
<2-1,Sheldon>这个逻辑完全是个谬误
<2-1,Sheldon>The logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc.

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,300
<2-1,Sheldon>不  我没有用爱斯基摩口吻跟你顶嘴
<2-1,Sheldon>No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,420
<2-2,Leonard>我去告诉佩妮我们回来了
<2-2,Leonard>I'm gonna go let Penny know we're back.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,820
<2-3,Sheldon>妈妈  我得挂了
<2-3,Sheldon>Mother, I have to go.

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,040
<2-3,Sheldon>爱你  拜
<2-3,Sheldon>Yeah, love you. Bye.

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,640
<2-3,Sheldon>好啊  老朋友
<2-3,Sheldon>Hello, old friend.

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,490
<2-3,Sheldon>爹爹回来了
<2-3,Sheldon>Daddy's home.

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,830
<3-1,Penny>莱纳德  你回来啦
<3-1,Penny>Leonard, you're back.

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,020
<3-2,Leonard>对  我过来跟你说...
<3-2,Leonard>Yeah. I just stopped by to say-- hmph!

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,160
<3-2,Leonard>-嗨  -嗨
<3-2,Leonard>- Yeah. So, hi.  - Hi.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,700
<3-4,Howard>妈的  早知道我先来说我们回来了
<3-4,Howard>Damn it, I should have gone over and told her we were back.

36
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,170
<3-5,Raj>就是  先到先得嘛
<3-5,Raj>Yeah, it was first-come, first-serve.

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
<3-5,Raj>生活大爆炸
<3-5,Raj>第三季第一集

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,010
<3-5,Raj>先跟你们俩声明
<3-5,Raj>I just want you both to know,

39
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,450
<4-1,Sheldon>等我发表我的发现时
<4-1,Sheldon>When I publish my findings,

40
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,490
<4-1,Sheldon>我不会忘记你们的付出的
<4-1,Sheldon>I won't forget your contributions.

41
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,850
<4-2,Howard>-太好了  -谢谢
<4-2,Howard>- Great.  - Thanks.

42
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,020
<4-4,Sheldon>但在诺贝尔领奖感言中不能提及你们
<4-4,Sheldon>Of course, I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech,

43
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,760
<4-4,Sheldon>不过写传记时
<4-4,Sheldon>but when I get around to writing my memoirs,

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,470
<4-4,Sheldon>我会在注脚上提到你们
<4-4,Sheldon>you can expect a very effusive footnote

45
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,020
<4-4,Sheldon>或者给你们一本我签名的传记
<4-4,Sheldon>and perhaps a signed copy.

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,280
<4-5,Raj>我们得告诉他
<4-5,Raj>We have to tell him.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
<4-6,Sheldon>告诉我什么
<4-6,Sheldon>Tell me what?

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,810
<4-7,Howard>该死的瓦肯听力[星际迷航]
<4-7,Howard>Damn his Vulcan hearing.

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,010
<4-8,Sheldon>你们打算给我办派对  是吧
<4-8,Sheldon>You fellows are planning a party for me, aren't you?

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,610
<4-9,Howard>谢尔顿  坐
<4-9,Howard>Okay, Sheldon, sit down.

51
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,770
<4-10,Sheldon>如果要搞主题派对的话  先告诉你们
<4-10,Sheldon>If there's going to be a theme I should let you know

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,570
<4-10,Sheldon>我不喜欢夏威夷式  罗马式和"海底式"
<4-10,Sheldon>that I don't care for luau, toga or "under the sea."

53
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,940
<4-11,Howard>我们会记在心里
<4-11,Howard>Yeah, we'll keep that in mind. Look...

54
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,110
<4-11,Howard>我们想谈谈在北极发生的一些事
<4-11,Howard>We need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.

55
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,570
<4-12,Sheldon>如果是说没有暖气那晚的事
<4-12,Sheldon>If this is about the night the heat went out,

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,900
<4-12,Sheldon>没什么好害臊的
<4-12,Sheldon>there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

57
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,520
<4-13,Raj>不是那件事
<4-13,Raj>It's not about that.

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,970
<4-14,Howard>我们说好不再提这个
<4-14,Howard>And we agreed never speak of it again.

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,750
<4-15,Sheldon>不就是一起裸睡嘛
<4-15,Sheldon>So we slept together naked.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,610
<4-15,Sheldon>这只是以防体温骤降而已
<4-15,Sheldon>It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.

61
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,220
<4-16,Howard>他还真说上了
<4-16,Howard>He's speaking about it.

62
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,730
<4-17,Raj>对我觉得  这可以促进我们的感情
<4-17,Raj>For me, it was a bonding moment.

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,380
<4-18,Howard>谢尔顿  你还记得开始几周
<4-18,Howard>Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,790
<4-18,Howard>我们在探测磁单极子
<4-18,Howard>We were looking for magnetic monopoles

65
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,120
<4-18,Howard>结果一无所获
<4-18,Howard>And not finding anything and you were acting

66
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,610
<4-18,Howard>你变成面目可憎的大JJ霸主吗
<4-18,Howard>like an obnoxious, giant dictator?

67
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,670
<4-19,Raj>我以为要婉转点跟他说呢
<4-19,Raj>thought we were going to be gentle with him.

68
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,970
<4-20,Howard>所以我才加了霸主
<4-20,Howard>That's why I added the "tator."

69
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,030
<4-20,Howard>接着终于测出一些可用数据时
<4-20,Howard>And then when we finally got our first positive data,

70
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,570
<4-20,Howard>你多高兴啊
<4-20,Howard>you were so happy.

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,910
<4-21,Sheldon>是啊
<4-21,Sheldon>Oh, yes.

72
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,090
<4-21,Sheldon>用表情字符表达就是：D[笑脸]
<4-21,Sheldon>In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital "D."

73
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,340
<4-22,Howard>其实  你的仪器侦测的数据
<4-22,Howard>Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected

74
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,310
<4-22,Howard>不是范式转变单极子的证据
<4-22,Howard>wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles

75
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,260
<4-22,Howard>那是...
<4-22,Howard>as it was...

76
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,840
<4-22,Howard>电动开罐刀具的静电
<4-22,Howard>static from the electric can opener

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,520
<4-22,Howard>我们在不停开关
<4-22,Howard>we were turning on and off.

78
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,560
<4-23,Raj>他的表情一下变成了：O[惊讶]
<4-23,Raj>He just went colon, capital "O."

79
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,580
<4-24,Sheldon>你们篡改了我的实验
<4-24,Sheldon>You tampered with my experiment?

80
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,760
<4-25,Howard>我们别无选择
<4-25,Howard>We had to.

81
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,940
<4-26,Raj>只有这样
<4-26,Raj>It was the only way to keep you

82
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,740
<4-26,Raj>你才不会变成狄更斯专家（混蛋JJ）
<4-26,Raj>from being such a huge Dickensian.

83
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,540
<4-26,Raj>懂吗  我加了专家
<4-26,Raj>You see that? I add the "ensian."

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,310
<4-27,Sheldon>莱纳德知道吗
<4-27,Sheldon>Did Leonard know about this?

85
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,180
<4-27,Sheldon>他是我最好的朋友
<4-27,Sheldon>Leonard's my best friend in the world.

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,380
<4-27,Sheldon>他肯定不知道
<4-27,Sheldon>Surely Leonard didn't know.

87
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,700
<4-28,Howard>其实  这是他的主意
<4-28,Howard>Actually, it was his idea.

88
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,530
<4-29,Sheldon>当然是莱纳德  试验计划是他制定的
<4-29,Sheldon>Of course it was. The whole plan weeks of Leonard.

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,030
<5-1,Penny>-我好想你  -我也好想你
<5-1,Penny>- I missed you so much.  - I missed you, too

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,290
<5-3,Penny>你不在  我都没想其他人
<5-3,Penny>I couldn't even think of anyone else while you were gone.

91
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,770
<5-4,Leonard>我也是
<5-4,Leonard>Me, neither.

92
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,770
<5-4,Leonard>除了没有暖气那晚
<5-4,Leonard>Except for one night when the heat went out.

93
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,250
<5-4,Leonard>说来话长  别问了
<5-4,Leonard>Long story. It's... Don't ask.

94
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,150
<5-5,Sheldon>莱纳德
<5-5,Sheldon>Leonard.

95
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,930
<5-6,Leonard (whispering)>别出声
<5-6,Leonard (whispering)>Do not make a sound.

96
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,200
<5-7,Sheldon>你在低声说"别出声"
<5-7,Sheldon>Whispering, "Do not make a sound..."

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,500
<5-7,Sheldon>就出声了
<5-7,Sheldon>...is a sound.

98
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,930
<5-7,Sheldon>该死的瓦肯听力
<5-7,Sheldon>Damn his Vulcan hearing.

99
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,680
<5-8,Leonard>现在没空  谢尔顿
<5-8,Leonard>Not a good time, Sheldon.

100
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,740
<5-9,Sheldon>佩妮
<5-9,Sheldon>Penny.

101
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,580
<5-9,Sheldon>佩妮  佩妮
<5-9,Sheldon>Penny. Penny.

102
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,670
<5-10,Penny>啊  真是要命
<5-10,Penny>Oh, this is ridicules.

103
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,480
<5-10,Penny>干嘛
<5-10,Penny>What?

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,570
<5-11,Sheldon>你好  佩妮
<5-11,Sheldon>Hello, Penny

105
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,170
<5-11,Sheldon>我明白你现在正完全被
<5-11,Sheldon>I realize you're currently at the mercy

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,490
<5-11,Sheldon>最原始的野性冲动所控制
<5-11,Sheldon>of your primitive biological urges,

107
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,000
<5-11,Sheldon>可是 反正你这辈子还会有
<5-11,Sheldon>but as you have an entire lifetime

108
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,100
<5-11,Sheldon>无数错误的决定  我能不能打断这一个?
<5-11,Sheldon>of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?

109
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,520
<5-12,Penny>我也很高兴见到你  请进
<5-12,Penny>It's great to see you too. Come on in.

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,800
<5-13,Sheldon>沃罗威茨刚告诉我你的那个大骗局
<5-13,Sheldon>Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception.

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,580
<5-13,Sheldon>你有没有什么要解释的
<5-13,Sheldon>Do you have anything to say for yourself?

112
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,010
<5-13,Sheldon>是的  我对此觉得十分难过
<5-13,Sheldon>Yes, I feel terrible about it.

113
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,440
<5-14,Leonard>我绝不能原谅我自己  我也不准备你会
<5-14,Leonard>I will never forgive myself, I don't expect you to, either,

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,670
<5-14,Leonard>我想你应该让我留在这儿跟佩妮
<5-14,Leonard>and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny

115
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,380
<5-14,Leonard>做一下自我检查和深刻忏悔
<5-14,Leonard>for a session of self-criticism and repentance.

116
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,870
<5-15,Penny>啊  你们能不能告诉我究竟是怎么回事儿
<5-15,Penny>Okay, can someone please tell me what's going on here?

117
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,430
<5-16,Sheldon>事情是  他们让我以为
<5-16,Sheldon>What's going on is I was lead to believe

118
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,550
<5-16,Sheldon>我在科学研究上有了惊天动地的大发现
<5-16,Sheldon>I was making groundbreaking strides in science,

119
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,960
<5-16,Sheldon>而事实上  我记录的数据是错的
<5-16,Sheldon>when in fact, I was being fed

120
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,800
<5-16,Sheldon>是沃罗威茨和库萨帕里
<5-16,Sheldon>false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali

121
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,410
<5-16,Sheldon>还有你这个小毛毛孩儿做出来的
<5-16,Sheldon>and your furry little boy toy.

122
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,110
<5-17,Penny>真的吗
<5-17,Penny>Is that true?

123
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,760
<5-18,Leonard>只有这样才能让他高兴啊
<5-18,Leonard>It was the only way to make him happy.

124
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,250
<5-19,Penny>可是你干嘛非要让他高兴呢
<5-19,Penny>Well, why'd you have to make him happy?

125
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,780
<5-20,Leonard>因为他不高兴的时候  我们都想杀了他
<5-20,Leonard>Because when he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him.

126
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,460
<5-20,Leonard>我们甚至有过计划
<5-20,Leonard>There was even a plan.

127
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,750
<5-20,Leonard>我们打算把他的炉子扔到外头
<5-20,Leonard>We were going to throw his kindle outside,

128
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,460
<5-20,Leonard>等他出去捡的时候  把门锁上
<5-20,Leonard>and when he went to get it, lock the door

129
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,150
<5-20,Leonard>冻死他
<5-20,Leonard>and let him freeze to death.

130
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,850
<5-21,Sheldon>这听起来有点过分吧
<5-21,Sheldon>That seems like a bit of an overreaction.

131
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,410
<5-22,Leonard>这不是  过分的计划是把你四肢绑到
<5-22,Leonard>No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs

132
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,670
<5-22,Leonard>四队雪撬狗上  然后大喊"驾"
<5-22,Leonard>to four different sled dog teams and yell, "Mush."

133
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,130
<5-22,Leonard>听者  我们保存了原始数据
<5-22,Leonard>Look, we kept the original data.

134
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,640
<5-22,Leonard>你还是可以发表你的结果
<5-22,Leonard>You can still publish the actual results.

135
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,520
<5-23,Sheldon>但是本来的结果失败了啊
<5-23,Sheldon>Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful

136
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,550
<5-23,Sheldon>而我已经给大学里所有人发了电邮
<5-23,Sheldon>and I've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university

137
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,270
<5-23,Sheldon>告诉他们我证实了弦理论
<5-23,Sheldon>explaining that I have confirmed string theory

138
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,760
<5-23,Sheldon>并且永远地改变了人类对宇宙的认识
<5-23,Sheldon>and forever changed man's understanding of the universe.

139
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,350
<5-24,Leonard>啊  真是  唉  你也许不该这么做的
<5-24,Leonard>Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that.

140
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,760
<5-24,Leonard>那就再写一封  告诉他们真相
<5-24,Leonard>So write another e-mail. Set the record straight.

141
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,970
<5-24,Leonard>没什么大不了的
<5-24,Leonard>It's no big deal.

142
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,120
<5-25,Sheldon>你说得对  莱纳德
<5-25,Sheldon>You're right, Leonard.

143
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,590
<5-25,Sheldon>没什么大不了的
<5-25,Sheldon>It's not a big deal.

144
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,570
<5-25,Sheldon>你不过是欺骗了我  摧毁了我的梦想
<5-25,Sheldon>All you did was lie to me, destroy my dream

145
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,360
<5-25,Sheldon>并且在全校人面前羞辱了我
<5-25,Sheldon>and humiliate me in front of the whole university.

146
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,430
<5-25,Sheldon>这个  告诉你  是讽刺
<5-25,Sheldon>That, FYI, was sarcasm.

147
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,460
<5-25,Sheldon>事实上  我相信这是很大很大的事情
<5-25,Sheldon>I, in fact, believe it is a big deal.

148
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,940
<5-26,Penny>哦  多可怜啊
<5-26,Penny>Oh, the poor thing.

149
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,460
<5-27,Leonard>是啊  我很难过
<5-27,Leonard>Yeah, I feel terrible.

150
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,300
<5-28,Penny>等等  你不去跟他谈谈吗
<5-28,Penny>Wait wait, aren't you going to go talk to him?

151
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,670
<5-29,Leonard>什么  呃  他没事的
<5-29,Leonard>What? Uh, he'll be fine.

152
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,470
<5-29,Leonard>那家伙很坚强的  过来么
<5-29,Leonard>The guy's a trooper. Come here.

153
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,560
<5-30,Penny>你说的对  你是不该跟他谈
<5-30,Penny>No, you're right-- you shouldn't talk to him.

154
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,180
<5-30,Penny>该我来
<5-30,Penny>I will.

155
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,690
<5-31,Leonard>天哪  我怎么就没一点好运呢
<5-31,Leonard>Man, I cannot catch a break.

156
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,500
<6-1,Penny>想聊聊吗
<6-1,Penny>Do you want to talk?

157
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,220
<6-2,Sheldon>聊什么
<6-2,Sheldon>About what?

158
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,390
<6-2,Sheldon>聊我是怎么被朋友欺骗的吗
<6-2,Sheldon>Being betrayed by my friends?

159
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,780
<6-2,Sheldon>毫无意义地在北极呆了三个月
<6-2,Sheldon>Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing?

160
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,790
<6-2,Sheldon>我连动漫展都没去成
<6-2,Sheldon>And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con!

161
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,230
<6-3,Penny>哦  亲爱...
<6-3,Penny>Oh, hon...

162
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,780
<6-3,Penny>嗯
<6-3,Penny>Uh...

163
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,280
<6-3,Penny>软软的猫猫  温温的猫猫...
<6-3,Penny>Soft kitty, warm kitty...

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,190
<6-4,Sheldon>那是我生病时候唱的  伤心不是生病
<6-4,Sheldon>That's for when I'm sick. Sad is not sick.

165
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,540
<6-5,Penny>对不起
<6-5,Penny>Oh. Sorry.

166
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,860
<6-5,Penny>我不知道你伤心的歌啊
<6-5,Penny>I don't know your sad song.

167
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,300
<6-6,Sheldon>我没有伤心的歌  我又不是小孩儿
<6-6,Sheldon>I don't have a sad song. I'm not a child.

168
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,480
<6-7,Penny>你知道么  我其实理解你的心情
<6-7,Penny>Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.

169
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,750
<6-7,Penny>真的吗
<6-7,Penny>Really?

170
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,880
<6-8,Sheldon>你刚刚被人抢走了服务员的
<6-8,Sheldon>Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing

171
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,600
<6-8,Sheldon>诺贝尔奖吗
<6-8,Sheldon>stolen from you?

172
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,340
<6-9,Penny>没有  不过我高三的时候
<6-9,Penny>Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school,

173
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,730
<6-9,Penny>我的一个朋友听说
<6-9,Penny>one of my friends heard

174
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,720
<6-9,Penny>我会被选为啦啦队的队长
<6-9,Penny>I was going to be named head cheerleader.

175
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,370
<6-9,Penny>哦  我那个高兴啊
<6-9,Penny>Oh, I was so excited.

176
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,070
<6-9,Penny>我妈甚至给我烤了一个庆祝馅饼
<6-9,Penny>My mom even made me a celebration pie.

177
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,060
<6-9,Penny>结果他们把队长给了那个笨透了的瓦丽瑞·马斯巴赫
<6-9,Penny>Then they named stupid Valerie Mosbacher head cheerleader.

178
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,600
<6-9,Penny>那个贱货
<6-9,Penny>Big old slutbag.

179
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,790
<6-10,Sheldon>你是说
<6-10,Sheldon>Are you saying

180
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,160
<6-10,Sheldon>你认为"庆祝馅饼"
<6-10,Sheldon>that you think a "celebtion pie"

181
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,390
<6-10,Sheldon>能跟诺贝尔奖相提并论吗
<6-10,Sheldon>is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?

182
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,030
<6-11,Penny>嗯  那馅饼很好吃呢
<6-11,Penny>Well, they're pretty tasty.

183
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,320
<6-12,Sheldon>还有一个不同的  但并非完全无关的事情
<6-12,Sheldon>And on a different, but not unrelated topic,

184
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,200
<6-12,Sheldon>就看你现在对我的鼓励方式
<6-12,Sheldon>based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits,

185
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,570
<6-12,Sheldon>你难道真相信你能胜任
<6-12,Sheldon>do you truly believe that you were ever fit

186
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,770
<6-12,Sheldon>给运动员加油的工作吗
<6-12,Sheldon>to be a cheer leader?

187
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,810
<6-13,Penny>听着  谢尔顿  我只是不认为
<6-13,Penny>Look, Sheldon, I just don't think

188
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,140
<6-13,Penny>莱纳德他们真想伤害你
<6-13,Penny>that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you.

189
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,460
<6-13,Penny>你明白吗  他们只是为了摆脱困境
<6-13,Penny>You know? They just told an unfortunate lie

190
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,520
<6-13,Penny>而撒了个很糟的谎
<6-13,Penny>to deal with a difficult situation.

191
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,110
<6-13,Penny>好吧  你知道是什么样吗
<6-13,Penny>Okay, you know what it's like?

192
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,560
<6-14,Sheldon>记得那个新的《星际迷航》电影里
<6-14,Sheldon>Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie

193
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,530
<6-13,Penny>柯克要占领飞船
<6-13,Penny>when Kirk has to take over the ship,

194
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,700
<6-13,Penny>他就对史波克说了很多谎
<6-13,Penny>so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true,

195
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,290
<6-13,Penny>比如说史波克不在乎他妈妈的死之类的
<6-13,Penny>like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?

196
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,950
<6-14,Sheldon>我错过了动漫展  连新的《星际迷航》电影也错过啦
<6-14,Sheldon>I missed Comic- Con and the new Star Trek movie!

197
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,910
<7-1,Raj>我喜欢你的新造型
<7-1,Raj>I like the new look.

198
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,960
<7-1,Raj>谢谢
<7-1,Raj>Thanks.

199
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,760
<7-2,Howard>我称之为"克鲁尼" [著名演员]
<7-2,Howard>I call it "the Clooney."

200
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,200
<7-3,Raj>我称之为"玛丽和路易" [超级玛丽游戏系列]  不过无所谓
<7-3,Raj>I call it "the Mario and Luigi but whatever.

201
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,440
<7-3,Raj>嘿 谢尔顿怎么样了
<7-3,Raj>Hey, how's sheldon doing?

202
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,280
<7-4,Leonard>他早上从他房间出来时
<7-4,Leonard>Well, he came out of his room this morning

203
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,730
<7-4,Leonard>带着黑武士头盔
<7-4,Leonard>wearing his Darth Vader helmet and

204
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,770
<7-4,Leonard>想用“能量”砍死我
<7-4,Leonard>trying to chop me to death with the "force"

205
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,870
<7-4,Leonard>所以我觉得他好点了
<7-4,Leonard>so I would say "a little better."

206
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,310
<7-5,Howard>请原谅我突然改变我们的话题
<7-5,Howard>If I may abruptly change the subject,

207
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,480
<7-5,Howard>你最终有没有跟佩妮那样
<7-5,Howard>did you and Penny finally... you know.

208
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,300
<7-7,Howard>-霍华德 -我本人是不关心
<7-7,Howard>- Howard... - Personally, I don't care,

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,550
<7-7,Howard>但是我的小弟弟叫我问你
<7-7,Howard>but my genitals wanted me to ask.

210
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,940
<7-8,Leonard>告诉你的小弟弟
<7-8,Leonard>Well tell your genitals

211
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,970
<7-8,Leonard>我跟佩妮的进展不关他的事
<7-8,Leonard>what I do with Penny is none of their business.

212
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,910
<7-9,Howard (to his genitals)>他说他们没发生那种事
<7-9,Howard (to his genitals)>He says they didn't do it.

213
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,250
<7-10,Leonard (to Sheldon, entering)>谢尔顿 这边
<7-10,Leonard (to Sheldon, entering)>Sheldon, over here.

214
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,700
<7-11,Howard>你在做什么
<7-11,Howard>What are you doing?

215
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,750
<7-12,Raj>他让我感到难受
<7-12,Raj>well, I feel bad for the guy.

216
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,000
<7-13,Leonard>谢尔顿 你为什么单独坐在那里
<7-13,Leonard>Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?

217
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,680
<7-14,Sheldon>因为我没有朋友
<7-14,Sheldon>Because I am without friends.

218
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,280
<7-14,Sheldon>我就像德国童谣唱的奶酪一样  独自生存
<7-14,Sheldon>Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone.

219
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,210
<7-14,Sheldon>[德语]独自就座
<7-14,Sheldon>Evenhile seated.

220
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,970
<7-15,Leonard>拜托 我们向你道歉了
<7-15,Leonard>Come on. We said we we sorry.

221
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,900
<7-16,Sheldon>你的一句"我很抱歉"
<7-16,Sheldon>It's going to take more than an "I'm sorry"

222
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,030
<7-16,Sheldon>和从佩妮店里面买的道歉馅饼
<7-16,Sheldon>and a store-bought apology pie from Penny

223
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,980
<7-16,Sheldon>都不能抵消你们对我犯下的罪行
<7-16,Sheldon>to make up for what you've done to me.

224
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,020
<7-17,Kripke (arriving)>嘿 库珀
<7-17,Kripke (arriving)>Hey, Cooper.

225
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,710
<7-17,Kripke (arriving)>我看到了你发的收回信
<7-17,Kripke (arriving)>Read your retraction email.

226
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,130
<7-17,Kripke (arriving)>这下你的名誉可毁了
<7-17,Kripke (arriving)>Way to destroy your reputation.

227
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,990
<7-18,Sheldon>看到了吧
<7-18,Sheldon>You see?

228
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,610
<7-18,Sheldon>整个早上人们一直指指点点嘲笑我
<7-18,Sheldon>People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.

229
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,060
<7-18,Sheldon>不光是今天早上
<7-18,Sheldon>That's not true.

230
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,960
<7-19,Kripke>人们一直都在指指点点嘲笑你
<7-19,Kripke>People have been pointing and laughing at you your whole life.

231
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,860
<7-20,Sheldon>好了 我受够了
<7-20,Sheldon>All right, I've had enough.

232
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,270
<7-20,Sheldon>各位请注意
<7-20,Sheldon>Attention, everyone.

233
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,100
<7-20,Sheldon>我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
<7-20,Sheldon>I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

234
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,460
<7-20,Sheldon>正如你们中的许多来自物理系的人所知
<7-20,Sheldon>As many of you in the physics department might know,

235
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,420
<7-20,Sheldon>我的事业轨迹出现了小小的曲折
<7-20,Sheldon>my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.

236
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,140
<7-21,Kripke>坠下了悬崖
<7-21,Kripke>Off a cliff.

237
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,780
<7-22,Sheldon>我的名誉多少受到了点损坏
<7-22,Sheldon>My credibility may have been damaged

238
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,040
<7-22,Sheldon>彻底损坏了
<7-22,Sheldon>Completely wrecked.

239
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,900
<7-24,Sheldon>但是我想提醒各位的是
<7-24,Sheldon>But I would like to remind you that in science,

240
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,580
<7-24,Sheldon>在科学领域不存在失败
<7-24,Sheldon>there's no such thing as failure.

241
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,990
<7-24,Sheldon>曾有一个人因为
<7-24,Sheldon>There once was a man who was referred to his prediction

242
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,170
<7-24,Sheldon>他对一个宇宙常数的预测而被称为他事业中的最大错误
<7-24,Sheldon>of a cosmological constant as the single "biggest blunder"

243
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,280
<7-24,Sheldon>这个人的名字就是
<7-24,Sheldon>of his career. That man's name was--

<7-24,Sheldon>你们猜  你们猜
<7-24,Sheldon>surprise, surprise--

<7-24,Sheldon>爱因斯坦
<7-24,Sheldon>Albert Einstein.

246
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,270
<7-25,Kripke>但是暗能量的研究
<7-25,Kripke>Yeah, but research into Dark Energy

247
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,250
<7-24,Sheldon>证明爱因斯坦的宇宙常数
<7-24,Sheldon>proved that Einstein's cosmological constant

248
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,450
<7-25,Kripke>是一直正确的  所以你仍然是一个
<7-25,Kripke>was actually right all along, so you're still--

249
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,810
<7-24,Sheldon>你们猜  你们猜
<7-24,Sheldon>surprise, surprise--

250
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,130
<7-25,Kripke>失败者
<7-25,Kripke>a loser.

251
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,350
<7-26,Sheldon>哦  你以为你很聪明
<7-26,Sheldon>Oh, you think you're so clever.

252
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,690
<7-26,Sheldon>但是  让我来告诉你
<7-26,Sheldon>Well, let me just tell you,

253
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,610
<7-26,Sheldon>虽然我现在想不出尖刻的话来反驳你
<7-26,Sheldon>while I do not currently have a scathing retort,

254
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,940
<7-26,Sheldon>但我想到之后会发邮件给你的
<7-26,Sheldon>you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.

255
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,180
<7-27,Leonard>我们和谢尔顿的友谊算是完了
<7-27,Leonard>So much for our friendship with Sheldon.

256
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,260
<7-28,Raj>不过暖气停了的那晚将会一直留在我们的记忆中
<7-28,Raj>Well, we always have the night the heat went out.

257
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,430
<8-1,Penny>-嗨 -嘿

<8-2,Leonard>Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night,

259
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,070
<8-2,Leonard>我没找到机会给你这个
<8-2,Leonard>I didn't have a chance to give you this.

260
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,640
<8-3,Penny>哦  莱纳德  你不用这样的
<8-3,Penny>Oh, Leonard, you shouldn't have.

261
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,310
<8-3,Penny>哦  天哪
<8-3,Penny>Oh, boy!

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,870
<8-4,Leonard>北极的雪花
<8-4,Leonard>From the North Pole.

265
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,970
<8-5,Penny>真的吗
<8-5,Penny>Are you serious?

266
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,140
<8-5,Penny>是啊
<8-5,Penny>Uh-huh.

267
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,270
<8-6,Leonard>永不变质的
<8-6,Leonard>It'll last forever.

268
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,570
<8-6,Leonard>我把它保存在纯净的 聚乙烯醇缩醛树脂里了
<8-6,Leonard>I preserved  in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.

269
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,470
<8-7,Penny>天哪
<8-7,Penny>Oh, my God.

270
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,610
<8-7,Penny>这是我听到但没能理解的话中
<8-7,Penny>That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me

271
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,170
<8-7,Penny>最浪漫的一句
<8-7,Penny>that I didn't understand.

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,470
<8-8,Leonard>其实这个过程挺简单的
<8-8,Leonard>It's actually a pretty simple process.

273

<8-8,Leonard>氰基丙烯酸酯这种单质会聚合于
<8-8,Leonard>You see, cyanoacrylates are monomers which polymerize on--

328
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,290
<9-14,Sheldon>我拒绝是基于个人意愿
<9-14,Sheldon>My objection was based on considerations

329
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,530
<9-14,Sheldon>而不是难度

<9-17,Mrs Cooper>他的眼睛烤得有点细
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>His eyes cames out a little thin,

334
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,580
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>不过你可以把他假想为中国人
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>But you can just pretend he's Chinese.

335
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,190
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>想谈谈你跟你朋友们怎么回事吗
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>Do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?

<9-18,Sheldon>-他们才不是我朋友  -好吧

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,550
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>回想一下  你小的时候
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>If you recall, when you were little,

339
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,490
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>也是这样谈起
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>We talked about some of the problems

340
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,700
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>你和邻居家孩子们相处上的一些问题
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>That you had get in along with the neighbor kids.

341
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,940
<9-20,Sheldon>那不同
<9-20,Sheldon>That was different.

342
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,390
<9-20,Sheldon>他们是因我的智慧而感受到威胁
<9-20,Sheldon>They were threatened by my intelligence

343
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,560
<9-20,Sheldon>又蠢得不知道这点  因此才恨我的
<9-20,Sheldon>And too stupid to know that's why they hated me.

344
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,760
<9-21,Mrs Cooper>宝贝  他们很清楚自己为什么恨你
<9-21,Mrs Cooper>Oh baby, they knew very well why they hate you.

345
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,100
<10-1,Leonard>真不敢相信你还真买了顶红色牛仔帽
<10-1,Leonard>I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat.

346
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,780
<10-2,Howard>配我里面穿的红色高领毛衣啊
<10-2,Howard>Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck

347
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,550
<10-2,Howard>再说  童装大号的只有这个色
<10-2,Howard>Plus, it was the only boys' large they had.

348
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,210
<10-3,Raj>抱歉  可这真不像德克萨斯
<10-3,Raj>I'm sorry, this does not look like Texas.

349
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,650
<10-3,Raj>风滚草呢  小酒馆呢 [老电影中德州常见景象]
<10-3,Raj>Where's the tumbleweeds? Whe's the saloons?

350
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,360
<10-4,Leonard>小酒馆
<10-4,Leonard>Saloons?

351
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,850
<10-5,Raj>对  像我从小在印度看的电影里那种
<10-5,Raj>Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India.

352
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,270
<10-5,Raj>比如《德州四杰》[1963年老电影]《德克萨斯的黄玫瑰》[民歌]
<10-5,Raj>You know, uh, Four for Texas,  Yellow Rose of Texes.

353
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,150
<10-6,Howard>这附近更像是电锯版的德州
<10-6,Howard>This neighborhood is more likeTexas Chainsaw

354
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,780
<10-7,Raj>我原指望能看到牛仔赶牛
<10-7,Raj>I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.

355
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,230
<10-8,Leonard>怎么说呢
