1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,760
<1-1,Sheldon>真希望你们能听到我的心声
<1-1,Sheldon>I wish you could all be inside my head.

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,990
<1-1,Sheldon>我脑中的对白简直是精彩纷呈
<1-1,Sheldon>The conversation is sparkling.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,030
<1-1,Sheldon>还是跟你们分享一下吧
<1-1,Sheldon>Fine, I'll tell you.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,240
<1-1,Sheldon>地衣是由菌类和藻类  这两不同的物种
<1-1,Sheldon>A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species,

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,720
<1-1,Sheldon>组成的复合有机体
<1-1,Sheldon>fungi and algae.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,660
<1-1,Sheldon>如果你能跟别的物种结合
<1-1,Sheldon>If you could merge with another species,

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,390
<1-1,Sheldon>你会选哪种  原因是什么
<1-1,Sheldon>what species would you pick and why?

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,120
<1-1,Sheldon>提示  有正确答案的哦
<1-1,Sheldon>Hint: There is a right answer.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,990
<1-1,Sheldon>你们肯定都猜不到
<1-1,Sheldon>None of you will get it.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,850
<1-2,Raj>好吧  我会选天鹅
<1-2,Raj>Okay, I'd pick swan because,

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,480
<1-2,Raj>因为半人半天鹅
<1-2,Raj>uh, the resulting hybrid would have

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,200
<1-2,Raj>既能享受人类先进的工业文明
<1-2,Raj>the advanced industrial civilization of a human

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,540
<1-2,Raj>又能拥有我一直梦寐以求的优雅长颈
<1-2,Raj>and the long graceful neck I've always dreamed of having.

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,130
<1-3,Sheldon>错  莱纳德
<1-3,Sheldon>Wrong. Leonard?

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,800
<1-4,Leonard>我选马  主要是因为马比较高
<1-4,Leonard>Horse, but mostly just for the height.

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,770
<1-4,Leonard>其次是因为生殖器比较大
<1-4,Leonard>A little bit for the genital girth.

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,260
<1-5,Sheldon>错  能让这话题保持点格调吗
<1-5,Sheldon>Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we?

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,600
<1-6,Howard>我选袋鼠
<1-6,Howard>Kangaroo, uh,

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,600
<1-6,Howard>这样我就成了"犹袋鼠"
<1-6,Howard>I'd be Kanga-Jew.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,930
<1-6,Howard>我将会是第一个能灌篮的犹太人
<1-6,Howard>The first of my people to dunk a basketball.

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,400
<1-7,Leonard>还不用住在你妈妈的房子里
<1-7,Leonard>Also instead of just living in your mother's house,

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,600
<1-7,Leonard>因为你可以直接住在她的袋子里
<1-7,Leonard>you could actually live inside her body.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,690
<1-8,Sheldon>挺妙的  但还是错
<1-8,Sheldon>Clever, but also wrong.

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,550
<1-8,Sheldon>人类最应该与之相结合的有机体
<1-8,Sheldon>No, the best organism for human beings to merge with

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,990
<1-8,Sheldon>是地衣本身
<1-8,Sheldon>is the lichen itself.

26
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,150
<1-8,Sheldon>这样  你既是人类  也是菌类和藻类
<1-8,Sheldon>That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae.

27
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,370
<1-8,Sheldon>三面手哦
<1-8,Sheldon>Triple threat.

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,590
<1-8,Sheldon>像三豆沙拉一样
<1-8,Sheldon>Like three-bean salad.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,260
<1-9,Leonard>给我举个例子  证明这三面手有用武之地
<1-9,Leonard>Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
<1-10,Sheldon>没问题  试想一下
<1-10,Sheldon>All right, picture this:

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,730
<1-10,Sheldon>一场高雅的户外音乐会
<1-10,Sheldon>a beautiful outdoor concert.

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,260
<1-10,Sheldon>作为人类  我能够欣赏贝多芬的音乐
<1-10,Sheldon>Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven.

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,970
<1-10,Sheldon>作为菌类  我能够沿着耸立的枫树生长
<1-10,Sheldon>As a fungus, I have a terrific view,

34
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,970
<1-10,Sheldon>以获得最棒的视野
<1-10,Sheldon>growing out of a towering maple tree.

35
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,170
<1-10,Sheldon>我也无需花钱买高昂的酒水
<1-10,Sheldon>And no thank you, expensive concessions.

36
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,500
<1-10,Sheldon>因为作为藻类  我以光合作用维生
<1-10,Sheldon>Because as an algae, I'll just snack on this sunlight.

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,240
<1-11,Raj>-他又赢了  -才不是
<1-11,Raj>- He got us again. - No, he didn't.

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,440
<1-12,Leonard>无论怎样  如果你不介意
<1-12,Leonard>Anyway, if it's okay with you,

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,640
<1-13,Raj>我们该讨论一下霍华德的单身派对了
<1-13,Raj>we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.

40
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,310
<1-14,Sheldon>我刚发表完关于地衣的大论
<1-14,Sheldon>Seems like a bit of a letdown

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,570
<1-14,Sheldon>你换谈这个  层次低好多啊  但...
<1-14,Sheldon>after our lichen conversation, but...

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,610
<1-14,Sheldon>我也不苛责了  毕竟你是半人半天鹅嘛
<1-14,Sheldon>what do you know, you're half swan.

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,830
<1-15,Raj>我研究了一下脱衣舞女
<1-15,Raj>I've been doing some research on strippers.

44
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,500
<1-15,Raj>其中一家说  如果不在乎表演者
<1-15,Raj>One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,730
<1-15,Raj>岁数与是否残疾  价钱绝对包君满意
<1-15,Raj>if we're flexible on age range and number of limbs.

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,970
<1-16,Howard>感觉挺有意思啊
<1-16,Howard>Sounds like loads of fun,

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,470
<1-16,Howard>可我已答应伯纳黛特  不找脱衣舞女了
<1-16,Howard>but I promised Bernadette no strippers.

48
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,930
<1-17,Raj>你居然不想找脱衣舞女
<1-17,Raj>You don't want strippers?

49
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,150
<1-17,Raj>装什么啊  你可是脱衣舞之王啊
<1-17,Raj>You're the king of strippers.

50
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,520
<1-17,Raj>北好莱坞的一家脱衣舞俱乐部
<1-17,Raj>The one club in North Hollywood

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,110
<1-17,Raj>还用你的名字命名了一根钢管呢
<1-17,Raj>named a pole after you.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,410
<1-18,Howard>怎么说呢  我对那玩意已经不感兴趣了
<1-18,Howard>What can I tell ya, I'm not into that stuff anymore.

53
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,110
<1-19,Leonard>不错啊  霍华德  真为你自豪
<1-19,Leonard>Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you.

54
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,950
<1-19,Leonard>可你是我们几人中第一个结婚的
<1-19,Leonard>And still, you're the first one of use to get married.

55
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,490
<1-19,Leonard>总得干点特别的事吧
<1-19,Leonard>We have to do something special.

56
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,320
<1-20,Sheldon>知道吗  德国人有个有趣的婚前习俗...
<1-20,Sheldon>You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom--

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,850
<1-21,Howard>估计不太适合我吧
<1-21,Howard>Well, it's probably not for me.

58
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,100
<1-22,Raj>去纳帕谷怎么样
<1-22,Raj>Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley.

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,460
<1-22,Raj>那里有品酒列车
<1-22,Raj>They've got that wine train.

60
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,870
<1-23,Sheldon>酒  坏东西
<1-23,Sheldon>Boo, wine!

61
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,890
<1-23,Sheldon>火车  好东西  我要加入
<1-23,Sheldon>But yay, trains. I'm in.

62
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,300
<1-24,Raj>现在这个时节  那里的景色很美
<1-24,Raj>Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year.

63
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,310
<1-24,Raj>穿行于葡萄园中
<1-24,Raj>Uh, you travel through the vineyards.

64
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,540
<1-24,Raj>火车上溢满葡萄酒的香气
<1-24,Raj>There's a tasting on board.

65
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,080
<1-24,Raj>漫山遍野的花朵争奇斗妍
<1-24,Raj>And all the wildflowers are in bloom.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,020
<1-24,Raj>简直是仙境
<1-24,Raj>Magic.

67
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,260
<1-25,Leonard>看啊  才过了三十秒
<1-25,Leonard>Look at that, in 30 seconds,

68
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,930
<1-25,Leonard>咱们从"玩女人"变"当女人"
<1-25,Leonard>we went from hiring women to being them.

78
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,750
<2-1,Penny>听说你们几个
<2-1,Penny>So, I hear you and the lost boys

79
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,530
<2-1,Penny>今晚要开个单身派对呢
<2-1,Penny>are having a bachelor party tonight.

80
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,470
<2-2,Leonard>是啊  就是去餐馆
<2-2,Leonard>Yeah, just going to a restaurant,

81
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,030
<2-2,Leonard>吃吃牛排  喝喝威士忌
<2-2,Leonard>get some steaks, and scotch.

82
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,240
<2-3,Penny>-你不用担心  -我有什么好担心的
<2-3,Penny>- Nothing to worry about. - Why should I worry?

83
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,620
<2-4,Leonard>始终是个单身派对嘛
<2-4,Leonard>Well, I don't know. It's a bachelor party.

84
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,650
<2-4,Leonard>兴许我们会找脱衣舞女来呢
<2-4,Leonard>There could be strippers.

85
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,390
<2-4,Leonard>你难道就一点都不吃醋吗
<2-4,Leonard>Wouldn't that make you a little jealous?

86
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,950
<2-5,Penny>拜托  莱纳德  我对你放心都很
<2-5,Penny>Oh, come on Leonard, it's you. What's going to happen?

87
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,070
<2-5,Penny>即使真的有脱衣舞女
<2-5,Penny>I mean, even if there was a stripper,

88
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,600
<2-5,Penny>你也不敢跟人有眼神接触
<2-5,Penny>all you'd do is avoid eye-contact

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,100
<2-5,Penny>没准还会主动提出辅导她孩子功课呢
<2-5,Penny>and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.

90
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,880
<2-6,Leonard>拜托  我很年轻  欲火如日中天
<2-6,Leonard>Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime.

91
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,870
<2-6,Leonard>天时地利人和具备  我也是能做出...
<2-6,Leonard>Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just,

92
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,560
<2-6,Leonard>非常疯狂的事情的呢
<2-6,Leonard>really crazy stuff.

93
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,680
<2-7,Penny>是吗  那说说你与女人做过
<2-7,Penny>Really? What is the craziest thing

94
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,040
<2-7,Penny>最最疯狂的事情是什么
<2-7,Penny>you've ever done with a woman?

95
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,910
<2-7,Penny>你我于海中"翻江倒海"的那次可不算
<2-7,Penny>And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,470
<2-8,Leonard>别这样啊  那必须得算
<2-8,Leonard>Oh, come on. That's got to count.

97
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,040
<2-8,Leonard>那天激流暗涌  我们可能随时葬身海底
<2-8,Leonard>There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.

98
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,920
<2-9,Penny>祝你今晚玩得痛快啊
<2-9,Penny>Well, have fun tonight.

99
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,390
<2-10,Leonard>放心吧  我会的
<2-10,Leonard>Oh, I will.

100
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,400
<2-10,Leonard>会发生什么事  我可不保证哦
<2-10,Leonard>There is no telling what might happen.

101
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,860
<2-11,Penny>绝对没事
<2-11,Penny>Yeah, there is.

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,920
<2-12,Leonard>帮特殊职业的女人辅导孩子过高考
<2-12,Leonard>You know, there's nothing wrong helping some woman's kid

103
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,410
<3-1,Leonard>我得好好夸夸拉杰
<3-1,Leonard>Hey, I got to hand it to Raj,

104
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,680
<3-1,Leonard>他找的餐馆还挺适合开单身派对呢
<3-1,Leonard>he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,240
<3-2,Sheldon>的确不赖
<3-2,Sheldon>It's not bad.

106
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,250
<3-2,Sheldon>但一与火车相比  这地方就相形见绌了
<3-2,Sheldon>Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.

107
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,830
<3-3,Leonard>你在喝威士忌吗
<3-3,Leonard>Are you drinking whiskey?

108
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,990
<3-4,Sheldon>没错
<3-4,Sheldon>Indeed.

109
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,900
<3-4,Sheldon>如果我要参与进这种社会习俗
<3-4,Sheldon>If I'm to participate in the social convention

110
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,260
<3-4,Sheldon>也就是这个单身派对
<3-4,Sheldon>that is the stag night,

111
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,760
<3-4,Sheldon>我就得接受所有的东西
<3-4,Sheldon>then I must embrace all its components:

112
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,350
<3-4,Sheldon>包括香烟  脏话
<3-4,Sheldon>including tobacco, swear words,

113
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,610
<3-4,Sheldon>当然还有酒
<3-4,Sheldon>and yes, alcohol.

114
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,370
<3-4,Sheldon>亲娘咧  太难喝了
<3-4,Sheldon>Jeepers! That's yucky.

115
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,120
<3-5,Leonard>活动才刚开始
<3-5,Leonard>Whoa, it's a little early to start

116
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,850
<3-5,Leonard>就把亲娘挂嘴边骂  太快了吧
<3-5,Leonard>dropping J-bombs, don't you think?

117
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,940
<3-6,Wil Wheaton>-你们好呀  -你好呀  威尔
<3-6,Wil Wheaton>- Hey, you guys. - Oh, hey, Wil.

118
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,540
<3-7,Leonard>谢谢能来参加霍华德的派对
<3-7,Leonard>Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.

119
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,110
<3-8,Wil>如果我不来这儿
<3-8,Wil>Well, it was either this or another

121
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,240
<3-8,Wil>就得去乔治·竹井家参加泡澡派对了
<3-8,Wil>hot tub party at George Takei's house.

122
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,250
<3-9,Sheldon>我不太明白
<3-9,Sheldon>I'm confused.

123
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,050
<3-9,Sheldon>我以为自从我们和解之后
<3-9,Sheldon>I thought since our reconciliation,

124
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,550
<3-9,Sheldon>这帮人里只有我才是你的朋友
<3-9,Sheldon>I was your friend in this group.

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,920
<3-10,Wil>霍华德也是我的朋友
<3-10,Wil>Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.

126
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,290
<3-11,Sheldon>原来你只求数量  不求质量
<3-11,Sheldon>I guess you're just friends with anybody.

127

177
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,220
<4-9,Penny>你应该问"会不会从霍华德的姓"这类问题
<4-9,Penny>Ask her things like "Are you going to take Howard's name?"

178
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,330
<4-9,Penny>而不是"谁会骑在谁的上面"

179
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,120

184
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,440

<4-11,Penny>before someone snaps it up.

185
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,840
<4-12,Bernadette>霍华德已经注册了

202
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,620
<5-7,Sheldon>按照传统习惯
<5-7,Sheldon>As is the tradition,

203
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,790
<5-7,Sheldon>我准备了一些无礼的笑话
<5-7,Sheldon>I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes

204
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,530
<5-7,Sheldon>来取笑霍华德  娱乐大众
<5-7,Sheldon>which generate humor at Howard's expense.

205
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,410
<5-7,Sheldon>准备笑到肚子疼吧
<5-7,Sheldon>Prepare to have your ribs tickled...

206
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,880
<5-7,Sheldon>霍华德
<5-7,Sheldon>Howard...

207
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,420
<5-7,Sheldon>我一直以为你会是我们当中最后结婚的人
<5-7,Sheldon>I always thought you'd be the last one of us to ever get married,

208
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,450
<5-7,Sheldon>因为你四肢短小  其貌不扬
<5-7,Sheldon>because you are so short and unappealing.

209
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,520
<5-7,Sheldon>我说的对吧
<5-7,Sheldon>Am I right?

210
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,240
<5-7,Sheldon>看看下面这个
<5-7,Sheldon>Let's see here.

211
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,280
<5-7,Sheldon>不过话说回来  霍华德
<5-7,Sheldon>Oh, seriously though, Howard,

212
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,620
<5-7,Sheldon>你其实是我认识的最聪明的人之一
<5-7,Sheldon>you're actually one of the most intelligent people I know.

213
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,850
<5-7,Sheldon>这是笑点  因为你不是
<5-7,Sheldon>And that's a zinger, because you're not.

214
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,220
<5-7,Sheldon>我一直以为  总有一天
<5-7,Sheldon>I've always thought that you'd make

215
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,290
<5-7,Sheldon>你会"做"个好丈夫
<5-7,Sheldon>someone a fine husband someday.

216
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,220
<5-7,Sheldon>前提是你能找齐零件
<5-7,Sheldon>Assuming you'd be able to get the parts,

217
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,750
<5-7,Sheldon>并拥有足够的工程技术
<5-7,Sheldon>and develop the engineering skills

218
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,780
<5-7,Sheldon>能把自己组装成好丈夫  不过应该是没戏吧
<5-7,Sheldon>to assemble them, which I don't see as likely.

219
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,190
<5-7,Sheldon>好笑吧
<5-7,Sheldon>Hacha!

220
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,650
<5-7,Sheldon>好  再看看这个
<5-7,Sheldon>Okay... Let me see here.

221
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,530
<5-7,Sheldon>好了  不说笑了
<5-7,Sheldon>Okay, kidding aside--

222

224
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,580
<5-8,Leonard>逗你玩  我才不呢
<5-8,Leonard>Bazinga, I don't!

225
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,050
<5-9,Sheldon>-谢尔顿  -还是逗你玩  我希望你好
<5-9,Sheldon>- Sheldon... - Double bazinga! I do!

<5-10,Leonard>霍华德·沃罗威茨要结婚了
<5-10,Leonard>So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot.

228
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,700
<5-10,Leonard>要将疯狂的单身生活抛诸脑后
<5-10,Leonard>Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind.

229
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,570
<5-10,Leonard>他是个疯狂的人
<5-10,Leonard>He was a wild one.

230
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,740
<5-10,Leonard>不过  我们又何尝不是呢
<5-10,Leonard>Well, I guess we all kind of were.

231
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,950
<5-10,Leonard>我记得有一次
<5-10,Leonard>I remember this one time,

232
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,730
<5-10,Leonard>我和一个姑娘去了海边
<5-10,Leonard>I was with this girl at the beach.

233
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,720
<5-10,Leonard>我们在海水里  然后开始亲热
<5-10,Leonard>We were in the ocean and we started making out.

234
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,870
<5-10,Leonard>我知道这挺疯狂的
<5-10,Leonard>I know, it was crazy.

235
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,630
<5-10,Leonard>我连耐克户外鞋都没穿呢
<5-10,Leonard>I wasn't even wearing my Aquasocks.

236
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,790
<5-10,Leonard>接下来
<5-10,Leonard>Then...

237
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,660
<5-11,Kripke>没人想听  霍夫斯塔德
<5-11,Kripke>Nobody cares, Hofstadter.

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,860
<5-11,Kripke>总结陈词吧
<5-11,Kripke>Wrap it up.

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,090
<5-14,Leonard>哥绝对"翻江倒海"过
<5-14,Leonard>I totally had sex in the ocean.

243
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,310
<5-14,Leonard>好吧  我来说几句吧
<5-14,Leonard>Okay, I'll go.

244
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,790
<5-15,Stuart>霍华德  当我想到你和伯纳黛特
<5-15,Stuart>Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette

245
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,610
<5-15,Stuart>马上要开始共筑美好人生时
<5-15,Stuart>starting this wonderful life together,

246
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,420
<5-15,Stuart>我就情不自禁地想哭
<5-15,Stuart>I can't help but get a little choked up.

247
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,080
<5-15,Stuart>我是说
<5-15,Stuart>I mean...

248
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,220
<5-15,Stuart>你看看你
<5-15,Stuart>look at you.

249
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,680
<5-15,Stuart>坐拥一切
<5-15,Stuart>You have everything.

250
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,620
<5-15,Stuart>你再看看我
<5-15,Stuart>Look at me.

251
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,640
<5-15,Stuart>我都三十七岁了
<5-15,Stuart>I'm 37.

252
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,160
<5-15,Stuart>还住在漫画书店的后面
<5-15,Stuart>I sleep in the back of a comic book store,

253
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,620
<5-15,Stuart>而且我的骨密度  堪比八十岁的老头
<5-15,Stuart>and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man.

254
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,170
<5-12,Leonard>敬霍华德
<5-12,Leonard>To Howard.

255
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,730
<5-13,All>敬霍华德
<5-13,All>To Howard.

256
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,830
<5-16,Raj>-谁是下一个  -我来
<5-16,Raj>- Um, uh, who's next?  - I'll go.

257
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,390
<5-17,Kripke>霍华德  我要说几句大家心里有胆想
<5-17,Kripke>Howard, I'm gonna say something to you that everybody's thinking

258
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,950
<5-17,Kripke>却没胆说出来的话
<5-17,Kripke>but no one has the courage to say out loud.

259
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,630
<5-17,Kripke>当你邀请一个男人参加单身派对时
<5-17,Kripke>When you invite a man to a bachelor party,

260
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,500
<5-17,Kripke>潜台词就是  现场会有脱衣舞女
<5-17,Kripke>the implication is, there will be strippers.

261
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,970
<5-17,Kripke>或许不是一丝不挂
<5-17,Kripke>Maybe not completely nude,

262
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,630
<5-17,Kripke>但至少得看见小内内或丁字裤吧
<5-17,Kripke>but at least pasties and G-strings.

263
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,420
<5-18,Raj>这要求相当合理
<5-18,Raj>That's not unreasonable.

264
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,450
<5-19,All>-说得好  说得好  -说得好  说得好
<5-19,All>- Hear, hear.  - Hear, hear.

265
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,580
<5-20,Raj>好了  还有谁要说两句吗
<5-20,Raj>Okay, uh, anybody else?

266
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,430
<5-20,Raj>没了吗
<5-20,Raj>Huh? No?

267
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,680
<5-20,Raj>好吧  那就由我这个伴郎来压轴吧
<5-20,Raj>Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man.

268
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,170
<5-20,Raj>这杯开胃酒把人家喝得"性致"大开哟
<5-20,Raj>Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper.

269
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,110
<5-20,Raj>言归正传  当我第一次来到这个国家时
<5-20,Raj>Okay, okay, when I first came to this country,

270
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,580
<5-20,Raj>我不懂如何待人处事  也不懂如何穿衣打扮
<5-20,Raj>I-I didn't know how to behave or how to dress,

271
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,510
<5-20,Raj>更不知道什么才叫做酷  人家那时候很寂寞
<5-20,Raj>or what was cool...I was pretty lonely.

272
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,420
<5-20,Raj>可当我遇到霍华德之后
<5-20,Raj>But then I met Howard,

273
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,640
<5-20,Raj>突然间  我的人生就此改变
<5-20,Raj>and suddenly, my life changed,

274
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,390
<5-20,Raj>因为有人陪我一起寂寞
<5-20,Raj>because we could be lonely together.

275
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,610
<5-20,Raj>这个男人变成了我的全世界
<5-20,Raj>This man became my whole world.

276
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,790
<5-21,Kripke>说得好  小美人
<5-21,Kripke>Yeah, nice speech, Francine.

277
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,900
<5-22,Raj>我还没说完呢  不过谢谢
<5-22,Raj>I'm not done, but thank you.

278
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,580
<5-22,Raj>我回想起...
<5-22,Raj>I think back....

279
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,010
<5-22,Raj>我们曾共度的美好时光
<5-22,Raj>...to all the good times we had, like, uh,

280
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,110
<5-22,Raj>比如说  我们那次去露营
<5-22,Raj>when we went camping and spent that night

281
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,070
<5-22,Raj>彻夜不睡  分享彼此的小秘密
<5-22,Raj>telling each other all our secrets.

282
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,780
<5-22,Raj>我告诉他  我很爱修脚
<5-22,Raj>I told him I'm addicted to pedicures

283
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,480
<5-22,Raj>而他告诉我  他的初夜给了他的表姐
<5-22,Raj>and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.

284
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,610
<5-23,Howard>那是我的远房表姐
<5-23,Howard>She was my second cousin.

285
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,150
<5-24,Sheldon>也是你第一个让人"不满足"的性伴侣
<5-24,Sheldon>And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually.

286
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,930
<5-24,Sheldon>逗你玩呀  逗你玩
<5-24,Sheldon>Ba-da-bazinga!

287
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,360
<5-25,Raj>没错  还有一次
<5-25,Raj>Oh...oh, yeah, and then there was the time

288
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,100
<5-25,Raj>我和莱纳德带霍华德去拉斯维加斯
<5-25,Raj>when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas

289
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,220
<5-25,Raj>我们雇了个妓女  让她假扮成犹太人
<5-25,Raj>and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish

290
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,390
<5-25,Raj>然后勾搭他  说想吃他的犹太"小黄瓜"
<5-25,Raj>and that she wanted his little kosher pickle.

291
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,480
<5-25,Raj>在所有的"霍华德搞妓女"的故事中
<5-25,Raj>Of all the "Howard humping hookers" stories,

292
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,290
<5-26,Howard>我最爱的就是这个了
<5-26,Howard>that one's my favorite!

293
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,980
<5-26,Howard>好了  兄弟  够了  坐下吧
<5-26,Howard>Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down.

294
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,820
<5-27,Raj>还有那个在动漫节上
<5-27,Raj>Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl

295
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,340
<5-27,Raj>扮成美少女战士的胖妞
<5-27,Raj>in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?

296
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,260
<5-28,Howard>不记得了  坐下吧
<5-28,Howard>Don't remember. Please sit down.

297
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,070
<5-29,Raj>那是我这辈子唯一一次3P经历
<5-29,Raj>The only threesome I've ever had in my life,

298
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,450
<5-29,Raj>而且我很自豪地说  就是跟这边这位男人一起干的
<5-29,Raj>and I'm proud to say it was with this man right here.

299
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,600
<5-30,Howard>我求求你闭嘴吧
<5-30,Howard>Oh, please shut up.

300
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,110
<5-31,Raj>千万别误会
<5-31,Raj>Oh, oh, don't get me wrong,

301
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,310
<5-31,Raj>我和霍华德之间什么也没发生
<5-31,Raj>nothing happened with me and Howard.

302
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,650
<5-31,Raj>我俩中间还夹了两百磅的美胖女战士呢
<5-31,Raj>There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.

303
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,320
<5-32,Wil (filming on his phone)>这段子绝对要在网上红爆了
<5-32,Wil (filming on his phone)>Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.

304
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,170
<5-33,Sheldon>亲娘咧  我喝高了
<5-33,Sheldon>Jeepers, I'm drunk.

305
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,000
<6-1,Howard>谢谢你来接我们
<6-1,Howard>Thank you for picking us up.

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,700
<6-1,Howard>威士忌瓶子上还贴着一条警示标语呢
<6-1,Howard>There's a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle.

307
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,800
<6-1,Howard>老弟  一杯下肚之后
<6-1,Howard>You cannot be operatin' heavy machinery

<6-2,Bernadette>好好笑
<6-2,Bernadette>Funny.

312
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,270
<6-3,Howard>如我保证般  十分低调
<6-3,Howard>Low-key, like I promised.

313
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,390
<6-3,Howard>没有乱来  没有脱衣舞女
<6-3,Howard>No hanky-panky, no strippers.

314
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,160
<6-3,Howard>只是一堆男人讲讲笑话而已
<6-3,Howard>Just the guys telling jokes.

315
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,830
<6-4,Bernadette>不错啊
<6-4,Bernadette>That's nice.

316

<6-5,Howard>你呢  你今晚玩得开心吗

<6-5,Howard>不错  我们包了一下礼物  喝了点红酒
<6-5,Howard>Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine,

318
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,660
<6-5,Howard>然后上网看到了这个
<6-5,Howard>and then went online and saw this.

319
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,610
<6-6,Raj’s Voice>在所有的"霍华德搞妓女"的故事中
<6-6,Raj’s Voice>Of all the "Howard humping hookers" stories,

320
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,770
<6-6,Raj’s Voice>我最爱的就是这段了
<6-6,Raj’s Voice>that one's my favorite.

321
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,890
<6-7,Raj>其实这离我家已经不远了
<6-7,Raj>You know, we're not that far from my apartment.

322
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,370
<6-7,Raj>你可以把我放下来  让我自己走回去吧
<6-7,Raj>If you stop the car, I can walk from here.

323
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,120
<6-8,Bernadette>你哪也别想去  3P男
<6-8,Bernadette>You ain't goin' anywhere, Threeway.

324
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,160
<6-9,Howard>-伯纳黛特  听着  -你骗了我
<6-9,Howard>- Bernadette, listen...  - You lied to me.

325
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,200
<6-10,Bernadette>你说你向我坦白了你所有的女人
<6-10,Bernadette>You said you told me about all the girls you've been with,

326
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,220
<6-10,Bernadette>可你从未提过你还睡过你的表姐
<6-10,Bernadette>but you never mentioned your cousin,

327
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,710
<6-10,Bernadette>妓女  还有拉杰
<6-10,Bernadette>the prostitute or Raj!

328
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,590
<6-11,Raj>说真的  你都用不着停车
<6-11,Raj>Seriously, you don't even have to stop the car.

329
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,230
<6-11,Raj>只要车速不超过每小时十英里
<6-11,Raj>Anything under ten miles an hour

330
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,460
<6-11,Raj>我就能安全跳下车
<6-11,Raj>and I can combat-roll into the street.

331
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,870
<6-12,Howard>好吧  我要澄清一下
<6-12,Howard>Okay, just to set the record straight,

332
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,240
<6-12,Howard>妓女不是我雇的  那是他送我的礼物
<6-12,Howard>I didn't hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him.

333
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,700
<6-12,Howard>你真不知廉耻  拉杰
<6-12,Howard>Shame on you, Raj.

334
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,300
<6-12,Howard>在美国  你可不能这样对待女人
<6-12,Howard>That is not how we treat women in this country.

335
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,970
<6-13,Bernadette>你少把一切都推到他头上
<6-13,Bernadette>Don't you try and blame this on him.

336
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,290
<6-15,Bernadette>-谢谢你  伯纳黛特  -闭嘴吧  变态
<6-15,Bernadette>- Thank you, Bernadette.  - Zip it, pervert!

337
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,480
<7-1,Bernadette>我不知道我该怎么办
<7-1,Bernadette>I don't know what I'm going to do.

338
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,720
<7-1,Bernadette>再过两个礼拜我就要嫁给霍华德了
<7-1,Bernadette>I'm supposed to marry Howard in a couple weeks

339
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,860
<7-1,Bernadette>可我不确定我是否还对这男人了若指掌
<7-1,Bernadette>and I'm not sure I even know who the man is anymore.

340
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,700
<7-2,Amy>我很好奇你最郁闷的是哪件
<7-2,Amy>I'm curious what's bothering you most:

341
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,780
<7-2,Amy>近亲乱伦  招妓
<7-2,Amy>the borderline incest, the prostitute

342
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,630
<7-2,Amy>还是跟穿得像儿童卡通的女孩玩3P
<7-2,Amy>or group sex with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?

343
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,270
<7-3,Penny>艾米  还记得我教过你
<7-3,Penny>Amy, remember when we went over things

344
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,440
<7-3,Penny>什么话该说  什么话不该说吗
<7-3,Penny>that would be helpful and things that wouldn't?

345
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,050
<7-3,Penny>记得
<7-3,Penny>Right.

346
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,840
<7-4,Amy>-那我刚才说的话...  -不该说
<7-4,Amy>- And that was... - Not.

347
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,810
<7-6,Bernadette>我初识霍华德时  觉得他很纯良
<7-6,Bernadette>When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me,

348
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,310
<7-6,Bernadette>只是个跟妈妈同住的善良小伙
<7-6,Bernadette>just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.

349
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,440
<7-7,Penny>你要是喜欢这样的男生
<7-7,Penny>Well, if that's what you like,

350
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,980
<7-7,Penny>我可以带你去漫画书店
<7-7,Penny>I'll take you to the comic book store--

351
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,550
<7-7,Penny>那里都是这样的小伙
<7-7,Penny>the place is full of 'em.

352
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,310
<7-8,Bernadette>等下
<7-8,Bernadette>Wait a minute.

353
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,530
<7-8,Bernadette>是你撮合我和霍德华的
<7-8,Bernadette>You set me up with Howard.

354
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,600
<7-8,Bernadette>你当时就知道他做的全部恶心事吗
<7-8,Bernadette>Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?

355
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,920
<7-9,Penny>一点点吧  道听途说而已
<7-9,Penny>Well, a little. You hear stuff...

356
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,000
<7-10,Bernadette>你为什么不告诉我
<7-10,Bernadette>Why didn't you tell me?

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,730
<7-11,Penny>我想告诉你的  但我觉得
<7-11,Penny>Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think

358
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,430
<7-11,Penny>你们肯定撑不过第一次约会
<7-11,Penny>it would go past the first date.

359
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,950
<7-11,Penny>撑过之后  我又觉得
<7-11,Penny>Then, when it did, I thought for sure

360
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,530
<7-11,Penny>等见完她妈妈  你们俩也该分手了吧
<7-11,Penny>it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother.

361
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,700
<7-11,Penny>最迟等到滚过床单后  也肯定该分了
<7-11,Penny>Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together.

362
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,640
<7-11,Penny>处处都是警告信号
<7-11,Penny>I mean, the warning signs were there--

363
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,840
<7-11,Penny>要怪也只能怪你
<7-11,Penny>this is really on you.

364
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,410
<7-12,Bernadette>老天啊
<7-12,Bernadette>God!

365
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,100
<7-12,Bernadette>亏我还把你当朋友
<7-12,Bernadette>I thought you were my friend.

366
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,510
<7-13,Amy>你刚说的  也是不该讲的吧
<7-13,Amy>I don't think that was helpful.

367
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,550
<8-1,Howard>小妮妮  还是我
<8-1,Howard>Hi, Bernie, it's me again.

368
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,210
<8-1,Howard>请给我回电
<8-1,Howard>Please call me back.

369
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,330
<8-2,Raj>兄弟  我太对不起你了
<8-2,Raj>Dude, I am so sorry.

370
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,580
<8-3,Howard>这不是你的错  是我的
<8-3,Howard>It's not your fault, it's mine.

371
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,890
<8-3,Howard>事都是我干的  不是你
<8-3,Howard>I did all that stuff, not you.

372
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,350
<8-4,Leonard>事实上  有一件倒是你们俩一起"干"的
<8-4,Leonard>Actually, you did do one of them together.

373
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,650
<8-5,Sheldon>给
<8-5,Sheldon>Here.

374
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,770
<8-6,Howard>这是什么
<8-6,Howard>What is this?

375
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,440
<8-7,Sheldon>你很低落
<8-7,Sheldon>You're upset.

376
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,440
<8-7,Sheldon>按我的习惯  要给伤心人一杯热饮
<8-7,Sheldon>The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.

377
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,940
<8-8,Howard>不是  我是说这是什么热饮
<8-8,Howard>No, but what is it?

378
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,280
<8-9,Sheldon>鸡汤
<8-9,Sheldon>Chicken broth.

379
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,330
<8-9,Sheldon>犹太人也都爱喝鸡汤嘛
<8-9,Sheldon>It seemed culturally appropriate.

380
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,530
<8-9,Sheldon>而且  这一整块鸡精块
<8-9,Sheldon>Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon

381
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,040
<8-9,Sheldon>从我刚搬进来就在那橱柜里了
<8-9,Sheldon>in the cupboard when I moved in

382
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,370
<8-9,Sheldon>这事困扰了我八年之久
<8-9,Sheldon>and it's been bothering me for the last eight years...

383
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,610
<8-9,Sheldon>正所谓  一石二鸟嘛
<8-9,Sheldon>So, as they say, two birds.

384
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,960
<8-10,Howard>我不知道接下来该怎么做了
<8-10,Howard>I don't know what my next move is.

385
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,460
<8-11,Leonard>霍华德  我不大了解女人
<8-11,Leonard>Well, Howard, I don't know much about women...

386
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,470
<8-13,Leonard>-然后呢  -没了  就这句话
<8-13,Leonard>- Yeah? - No, uh, that, that's it.

387
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,260
<8-11,Leonard>我不大了解女人
<8-11,Leonard>I don't know much about women.

388
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,270
<8-13,Leonard>拉杰  你有建议吗
<8-13,Leonard>Raj, you got anything?

389
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,310
<8-14,Raj>我有漫画展上那个胖妞的电话号码
<8-14,Raj>I've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.

390
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,110
<8-15,Howard>我才不打给漫画展认识的妞
<8-15,Howard>I'm not calling the girl from Comic-con.

391
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,330
<8-15,Howard>好吧
<8-15,Howard>All right.

392
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,350
<8-16,Raj>那美胖女战士  我独享咯
<8-16,Raj>More Sailor Moon for me.

393
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,300
<8-17,Sheldon>我把单身派对吐光光了
<8-17,Sheldon>I just threw up the bachelor party.

394
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,260
<9-1,Penny>求你出来吧  伯纳黛特
<9-1,Penny>Please come out, Bernadette.

395
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,860
<9-1,Penny>我们来谈谈
<9-1,Penny>Let's talk through this.

396
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,840
<9-2,Bernadette>不要  别理我
<9-2,Bernadette>No, leave me alone.

397
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,670
<9-3,Amy>或许你该以其人之道还治其人之身
<9-3,Amy>Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine.

398
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,980
<9-3,Amy>你有没有特别迷人的表兄弟
<9-3,Amy>Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?

399
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,990
<9-4,Penny>艾米
<9-4,Penny>Amy.

400
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,870
<9-5,Amy>是你把那个下流胚子介绍给她的
<9-5,Amy>Hey, you introduced her to the sleazebag.

401
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,760
<9-5,Amy>我只是帮你收拾烂摊子
<9-5,Amy>I'm just trying to clean up your mess.

402
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,950
<9-8,Howard>我想找伯纳黛特谈谈
<9-8,Howard>I need to talk to Bernadette.

403
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,820
<9-9,Penny>她现在估计不想跟任何人谈吧
<9-9,Penny>Well, I don't think she wants to talk to anyone right now.

404
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,430
<9-10,Howard>好吧  能请你至少帮我转告她吗
<9-10,Howard>All right, well, could you at least give her a message?

405
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,170
<9-11,Penny>当然
<9-11,Penny>Yeah, sure, I guess.

406
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,070
<9-12,Howard>告诉她我真的很抱歉
<9-12,Howard>Tell her I'm really sorry.

407
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:51,030
<9-12,Howard>如果她不想嫁给我了  我能理解
<9-12,Howard>And if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it.

408
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,480
<9-12,Howard>但我真的想让她明白
<9-12,Howard>But what I really want her to know

409
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,860
<9-12,Howard>她所厌恶的那个我
<9-12,Howard>is the guy that she's disgusted by,

410
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,080
<9-12,Howard>也是我所厌恶的
<9-12,Howard>is the guy that I'm disgusted by, too.

411
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,290
<9-12,Howard>但昨日种种譬如昨日死
<9-12,Howard>But that guy doesn't exist anymore; he's gone.

412
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:06,760
<9-12,Howard>正是因为她  我才改过自新
<9-12,Howard>And the reason is because of her.

413
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,240
<9-12,Howard>如果她要跟我分手
<9-12,Howard>So, if this relationship is over,

414
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,410
<9-12,Howard>请帮我告诉她  是她让我成为更好的男人(重获新生)
<9-12,Howard>let her know that she made me a better man,

415
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,430
<9-12,Howard>帮我谢谢她
<9-12,Howard>and tell her thank you.

416
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,030
<9-13,Penny>天啊  霍华德
<9-13,Penny>Oh, my God, Howard.

417
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,530
<9-13,Penny>那是我听过最动人的话语
<9-13,Penny>That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.

418
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,680
<9-13,Penny>而且还是你这货讲出口的
<9-13,Penny>And it came out of you.

419
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,600
<9-14,Bernadette>华仔
<9-14,Bernadette>Howie?

420
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,680
<9-15,Howard>佩妮有话要转告你
<9-15,Howard>Penny has a message for you.

421
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,410
<9-16,Bernadette>我都听到了
<9-16,Bernadette>I heard.

422
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,890
<9-16,Bernadette>你的声音跟你妈的一样
<9-16,Bernadette>Your voice, not unlike your mother's,

423
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,770
<9-16,Bernadette>穿墙入耳
<9-16,Bernadette>travels through walls.

424
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,960
<9-17,Howard>需要我离开吗
<9-17,Howard>Do you want me to go?

425
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,480
<9-17,Howard>不
<9-17,Howard>No.

426
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,300
<9-18,Bernadette>过来
<9-18,Bernadette>Come here.

427
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,890
<9-18,Bernadette>我还在很气你呢
<9-18,Bernadette>I'm still really mad at you.

428
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,420
<9-19,Howard>我明白
<9-19,Howard>I get that.

429
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,030
<9-20,Bernadette>你的过去  还有什么是我该知道的吗
<9-20,Bernadette>Is there anything else about your past I should know?

430
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,000
<9-21,Howard>还有几件吧  但大多数都发生在海外
<9-21,Howard>Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,570
<9-21,Howard>我之后再告诉你
<9-21,Howard>I'll tell you later.

432
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,800
<9-22,Bernadette>好吧
