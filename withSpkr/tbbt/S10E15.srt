1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,110
<1-1,Howard>我正在把微流控通道里的电渗流流速
<1-1,Howard>Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,560
<1-1,Howard>给归零了
<1-1,Howard>in the micro-fluidic channel.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,340
<1-2,Leonard>干得漂亮  霍华德
<1-2,Leonard>Nicely done, Howard.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,010
<1-3,Howard>我老婆身高147公分  性生活和谐
<1-3,Howard>Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,010
<1-3,Howard>很明显能看出我对于小东西很有一套
<1-3,Howard>so clearly I know my way around tiny things.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,940
<1-4,Leonard>给你点赞  在尖端新科技之前
<1-4,Leonard>Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,720
<1-4,Leonard>还能继续开这种
<1-4,Leonard>and still making inappropriate comments

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,550
<1-4,Leonard>不尊重你孩子母亲的玩笑
<1-4,Leonard>about the mother of your child.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,760
<1-5,Howard>你听到的  还只是我说出口的"干净版"呢
<1-5,Howard>Those are just the things I say out loud.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,110
<1-6,Sheldon>先生们  我们得立即停工
<1-6,Sheldon>Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:30,980
<1-7,Howard>出什么事了
<1-7,Howard>What's wrong?

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,270
<1-8,Sheldon>我看着这算式
<1-8,Sheldon>I'm looking at the math,

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,280
<1-8,Sheldon>我觉得我们能够做出
<1-8,Sheldon>and I think we can make the device

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,100
<1-8,Sheldon>比现有版本小8到10%的仪器
<1-8,Sheldon>between eight and ten percent smaller.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,870
<1-9,Leonard>很好啊  可是空军已经同意之前的规格了
<1-9,Leonard>That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs.

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,790
<1-9,Leonard>我们可以继续做下去了
<1-9,Leonard>We're good to go.

17
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,100
<1-10,Howard>对啊  没必要把它再做更小
<1-10,Howard>Yeah. It doesn't need to be smaller.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,330
<1-11,Sheldon>你们要不要脸了
<1-11,Sheldon>Shame on you.

19
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,450
<1-11,Sheldon>要是贵宾犬繁殖者都是你们这态度会怎么样
<1-11,Sheldon>Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude?

20
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,240
<1-11,Sheldon>我来告诉你们
<1-11,Sheldon>I'll tell you.

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,010
<1-11,Sheldon>我们现在只会有标准型跟迷你型贵宾犬
<1-11,Sheldon>We would have the standard and the miniature poodle,

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,440
<1-11,Sheldon>不会有玩具型跟茶杯型
<1-11,Sheldon>but no toy or teacup.

23
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,200
<1-11,Sheldon>顺带一说
<1-11,Sheldon>Which by the way,

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,900
<1-11,Sheldon>茶杯型并不是官方承认的品种
<1-11,Sheldon>is not an officially recognized breed,

25
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,520
<1-11,Sheldon>不过这都是贵宾犬界的事了
<1-11,Sheldon>but that's just poodle politics.

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,010
<1-12,Leonard>我们能不能不聊贵宾犬了
<1-12,Leonard>Can we please stop talking about poodles?

27
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,280
<1-13,Sheldon>行啊  巧克力棒
<1-13,Sheldon>Fine. Candy bars.

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,580
<1-13,Sheldon>你喜欢迷你版的吗  我知道你喜欢
<1-13,Sheldon>Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.

29
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,570
<1-14,Howard>谢尔顿  我们不需要把它做得更小了
<1-14,Howard>Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller.

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,460
<1-14,Howard>你的职责已经完成了  回家吧
<1-14,Howard>Your work is done. Go home.

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,910
<1-15,Sheldon>我不想回家
<1-15,Sheldon>I don't want to go home.

34
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,790
<1-16,Leonard>行  那你去散个步吧
<1-16,Leonard>Fine, go for a little walk.

35
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,780
<1-17,Sheldon>然后呢
<1-17,Sheldon>Then what?

36
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,350
<1-18,Leonard>你就一直走别停就对了
<1-18,Leonard>Just keep walking.

47
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,860
<2-1,Leonard>至少他去洗手间时这里很清静
<2-1,Leonard>At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.

48
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,440
<2-2,Howard>我知道啊
<2-2,Howard>I know.

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,540
<2-2,Howard>所以我才总在他不注意时  往他水杯里添水
<2-2,Howard>That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,260
<2-3,Leonard>你是在开玩笑吧
<2-3,Leonard>You're kidding.

51
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,670
<2-4,Howard>就算加水加到干旱  也是值得的
<2-4,Howard>I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,190
<2-5,Leonard>其实我还真有个方法可以摆脱他
<2-5,Leonard>You know, I-I do have a way to get him out of our hair.

53
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,750
<2-5,Leonard>我已经把这招留着几年了
<2-5,Leonard>I've been holding onto this for a few years,

54
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,150
<2-5,Leonard>或许现在是时候了
<2-5,Leonard>but maybe now's the time.

55
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,710
<2-6,Howard>我们锁上门也行啊  不用为此宰了他吧
<2-6,Howard>W-We can just lock the door; you don't have to kill him.

56
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,260
<2-6,Howard>我们才杀不了他
<2-6,Howard>You can't kill him;

57
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,660
<2-7,Leonard>他会在最后一次存档的点重生
<2-7,Leonard>he'll just respawn at the last save point.

58
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,730
<2-8,Sheldon>这是我第六次去上厕所了
<2-8,Sheldon>Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.

59
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,970
<2-8,Sheldon>反正不是因为尿路感染就好
<2-8,Sheldon>As long as that's not a urinary tract infection,

60
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,390
<2-8,Sheldon>这可是我个人新纪录呢
<2-8,Sheldon>that's a personal best.

61
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,530
<2-9,Leonard>兄弟  我有个礼物给你
<2-9,Leonard>Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.

<2-12,Sheldon>This doesn't happen very often,

72
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,060
<2-12,Sheldon>但大抱抱要来啦
<2-12,Sheldon>but here comes a hug.

77
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,860
<3-2,Amy>他甚至在他妈的悼词里都提了  就写吧
<3-2,Amy>Well, he mentioned it in his mother's eulogy, so why not?

78
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,250
<3-3,Penny>我真不敢相信你得为一个婴儿
<3-3,Penny>I can't believe you have to fill out

132
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,640
<4-10,Sheldon>守车的问题是  里面没有洗手间
<4-10,Sheldon>Now, the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom,

133
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,440
<4-10,Sheldon>简易宿舍的问题是  它不是守车
<4-10,Sheldon>but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.

134
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,390
<4-10,Sheldon>第一天
<4-10,Sheldon>On the first day,

135
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,960
<4-10,Sheldon>我可以开蒸汽机火车
<4-10,Sheldon>I get to drive a steam engine.

136
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,380
<4-10,Sheldon>第二天是柴油机火车
<4-10,Sheldon>Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine.

137
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,450
<4-10,Sheldon>还有还有
<4-10,Sheldon>Oh, and

138
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,070
<4-10,Sheldon>如果我自愿做轨道养护和文书工作
<4-10,Sheldon>if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork,

139
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,840
<4-10,Sheldon>那我想在那待多久都行
<4-10,Sheldon>they'll let me stay as long as I want.

140
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,390
<4-10,Sheldon>所以你最好带的衣服够我们余生穿
<4-10,Sheldon>So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.

141
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,710
<4-11,Amy>我现在可以尿尿了吗
<4-11,Amy>Can I pee now?

142
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,190
<4-11,Amy>听这个
<4-11,Amy>Oh, get this!

143
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,750
<4-12,Sheldon>我还能参加考试  试题出自一本125页的手册
<4-12,Sheldon>I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual.

144
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,900
<4-12,Sheldon>我可以学很多东西  比如手势信号
<4-12,Sheldon>I get to learn things like hand signals.

145
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,760
<4-12,Sheldon>前进  倒车
<4-12,Sheldon>There's forward, uh, reverse,

146
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,720
<4-12,Sheldon>刹车
<4-12,Sheldon>set the brakes.

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,620
<4-12,Sheldon>你完事了没
<4-12,Sheldon>Are you done yet?

148
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,680
<4-12,Sheldon>你错过了一些很赞的东西
<4-12,Sheldon>You're missing some great stuff out here.

149
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,480
<4-12,Sheldon>这个太赞了
<4-12,Sheldon>Oh, this is good.

150
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,480
<4-12,Sheldon>那里有许多铁路公路交叉口
<4-12,Sheldon>There are dozens of railroad crossings

151
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,500
<4-12,Sheldon>你必须得吹哨子指挥
<4-12,Sheldon>you have to blow the whistle for.

152
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,990
<4-12,Sheldon>我说的"你"是泛指  不是真的指你本人
<4-12,Sheldon>But that is the figurative you, not the literal you.

153
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,100
<4-12,Sheldon>我才是吹哨子那个
<4-12,Sheldon>I'll be blowing the whistle.

154
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,730
<4-12,Sheldon>艾米  起床  该上班了
<4-12,Sheldon>Amy, get up. It's time to go to work.

155
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,930
<5-1,Leonard>火车的吸引力比我想象中还要大
<5-1,Leonard>This train thing worked out better than I thought.

156
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,510
<5-1,Leonard>他现在在家学习火车驾驶员手册呢
<5-1,Leonard>He's home studying the engineer's manual.

157
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,360
<5-2,Howard>他不在  真的好安静啊
<5-2,Howard>It's so peaceful without him here.

158
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,000
<5-2,Howard>我能问问花了你多少钱吗
<5-2,Howard>Can I ask you how much that cost?

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
<5-3,Leonard>四千大洋  每一分都花得值
<5-3,Leonard>$4,000-- worth every penny.

160
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,850
<5-4,Col Williams>先生们
<5-4,Col Williams>Gentlemen.

161
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,030
<5-5,Leonard>-威廉姆斯上校  -先生
<5-5,Leonard>- Colonel Williams. - Sir.

162
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,340
<5-6,Col Williams>过来看看导向系统进展如何
<5-6,Col Williams>Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.

163
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,910
<5-7,Howard>很好  我们研究出一个冷却方案
<5-7,Howard>Great. We found a cooling solution

164
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,640
<5-7,Howard>可以让原型机的大小
<5-7,Howard>that allowed us to get the size of the prototype

165
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,350
<5-7,Howard>缩小至目标规格
<5-7,Howard>down to the target specs.

166
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,150
<5-8,Leonard>这个冷却方案  是不是很酷[冷]呢
<5-8,Leonard>As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.

167
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,660
<5-9,Col Williams>别开冷笑话
<5-9,Col Williams>Don't do that.

168
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,240
<5-9,Col Williams>这是什么
<5-9,Col Williams>What's this?

169
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,180
<5-10,Leonard>没什么  一些我们用不着的数学
<5-10,Leonard>Oh, nothing. Just some math we don't need.

170
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,500
<5-11,Col Williams>这是另一种方案
<5-11,Col Williams>This is a different approach.

171
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,330
<5-11,Col Williams>你们是想把这个导向系统做得更小吗
<5-11,Col Williams>Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?

172
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,420
<5-12,Leonard>这只是纸上谈兵
<5-12,Leonard>It's just a theory.

173
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,310
<5-12,Leonard>还没有实践成功呢
<5-12,Leonard>Uh, it's not even worked out.

174
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,480
<5-13,Col Williams>我要这个方案
<5-13,Col Williams>I want this.

175
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,040
<5-14,Howard>但我们已经做到之前约定的规格了
<5-14,Howard>But we've already met the agreed upon specs.

176
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,180
<5-14,Howard>将规格变小需要花好几周重新计算
<5-14,Howard>Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.

177
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,040
<5-15,Col Williams>那就让那个长袖套短袖的小孩做啊
<5-15,Col Williams>So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.

178
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,700
<5-16,Leonard>现在  请容许我说一句  我们已经花费
<5-16,Leonard>Sir, uh, I-if I may, uh, we've put a lot

179
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,530
<5-16,Leonard>大量的心思和功夫在现在这台原型机上
<5-16,Leonard>of thought and effort into this current prototype.

180
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,330
<5-16,Leonard>这真的是一个完美的方案了
<5-16,Leonard>It's a really elegant solution,

181
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,080
<5-16,Leonard>最重要的是  它可以实现
<5-16,Leonard>and most importantly, it works.

182
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,530
<5-17,Col Williams>我知道  我就要这个方案
<5-17,Col Williams>Yeah, I want this.

183
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,570
<5-18,Howard>但那个方案只是纸上谈兵
<5-18,Howard>But that's just a theory.

184
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,460
<5-18,Howard>甚至称不上是一个完整的构思
<5-18,Howard>It's not even a complete thought.

185
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,160
<5-19,Col Williams>你们俩说得都非常有道理
<5-19,Col Williams>You both make excellent points.

186
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,710
<5-19,Col Williams>感谢你们如此清晰地表达出来
<5-19,Col Williams>And thank you for presenting it so articulately.

187
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,800
<5-19,Col Williams>把这个方案做出来
<5-19,Col Williams>Make this.

188
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,410
<5-20,Howard>那个长袖套短袖的小屁孩再一次祸害了我们
<5-20,Howard>The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.

189
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,180
<6-1,Penny>好了  你们俩准备好疯狂玩乐了吗
<6-1,Penny>All right. You guys ready to get crazy?

190
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,760
<6-2,Amy>今天穿的可不是肉色内衣哦
<6-2,Amy>Well, the bra under here ain't beige.

191
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,090
<6-2,Amy>好了
<6-2,Amy>Okay.

192
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,940
<6-3,Raj>你们女士今晚好好玩
<6-3,Raj>You ladies have fun tonight.

193
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,360
<6-4,Stuart>别担心哈雷  有斯尔图特叔叔呢
<6-4,Stuart>Don't worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart's on the job.

194
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,520
<6-5,Raj>她的教父会密切监控他的工作
<6-5,Raj>Under the careful supervision of her godfather.

195
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,970
<6-6,Stuart>抱歉  我无意冒犯你  唐·柯里昂
<6-6,Stuart>My apologies. I didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.

197
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,810
<6-7,Raj>我都说啦  你们好好玩
<6-7,Raj>Like I said, you ladies have fun.

198
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,070
<6-8,Bernadette>会的  舞鞋穿上  母乳吸完
<6-8,Bernadette>We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump.

199
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,900
<6-8,Bernadette>狂欢开始
<6-8,Bernadette>Let's party.

200
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,370
<6-9,Penny>如果你在酒吧里吸奶
<6-9,Penny>You know, if you pump at the bar,

201
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,600
<6-9,Penny>我保证我们一定有免费酒水喝
<6-9,Penny>I promise we'll get free drinks.

202
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,420
<6-10,Bernadette>有问题就打给我
<6-10,Bernadette>Call if there's any problems.

203
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,020
<6-11,Penny>不许  她很忙  打给霍华德
<6-11,Penny>No. She's busy. You call Howard.

204
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,450
<6-12,Raj>知道了
<6-12,Raj>Got it.

205
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,620
<6-13,Bernadette>打给我  别打给霍华德
<6-13,Bernadette>Call me. Don't call Howard.

206
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,430
<6-14,Raj>我决不会打给霍华德
<6-14,Raj>I would never call Howard.

207
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,810
<6-15,Stuart>好了  与其整晚斗嘴
<6-15,Stuart>Okay, instead of arguing all night,

208
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,830
<6-15,Stuart>不如分分工如何照顾宝宝
<6-15,Stuart>let's just split up the baby chores.

209
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,180
<6-16,Raj>好的  上半身的嘴交给我来喂
<6-16,Raj>Yeah, great. Um, I'll put food in her top half,

210
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,790
<6-16,Raj>下半身拉的屎尿交给你来清
<6-16,Raj>you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.

211
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,110
<7-1,Howard>真不敢相信我们得请谢尔顿
<7-1,Howard>I can't believe we have to ask Sheldon

212
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,670
<7-1,Howard>回去帮忙我们
<7-1,Howard>to come back and help us.

213
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,590
<7-2,Leonard>你有我惨吗
<7-2,Leonard>Oh, boo-hoo.

214
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,840
<7-2,Leonard>我花了四千大洋买的礼物
<7-2,Leonard>I spent four grand on a gift

215
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,760
<7-2,Leonard>结果只能摆脱他一个下午
<7-2,Leonard>that only got rid of him for an afternoon.

216
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,510
<7-2,Leonard>那是什么声音
<7-2,Leonard>What is that?

217
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,710
<7-3,Howard>我不知道  但如果他大喊
<7-3,Howard>I don't know, but if he yells,

218
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,920
<7-3,Howard>"它是活的"  我们就赶紧跑
<7-3,Howard>"It's alive," we run.

219
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,350
<7-4,Sheldon>你们要是敲门了  我也听不见
<7-4,Sheldon>If you knocked, I couldn't hear you.

220
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,980
<7-4,Sheldon>我在焊接火车头呢
<7-4,Sheldon>I'm welding this locomotive engine.

221
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,580
<7-4,Sheldon>你们要是没敲门  拜托有点基本礼仪好吗
<7-4,Sheldon>And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?

222
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,020
<7-5,Howard>你是怎么把这玩意弄上楼的
<7-5,Howard>How'd you even get that up the stairs?

223
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,810
<7-6,Sheldon>我不断鼓励自己  "你行的  你行的"
<7-6,Sheldon>I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."

224
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,400
<7-6,Sheldon>结果我不行  于是...
<7-6,Sheldon>And then I couldn't, so...

225
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,300
<7-6,Sheldon>我花钱请了两个答应不会来抢我们的人搬的
<7-6,Sheldon>I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.

226
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,520
<7-7,Leonard>听着  谢尔顿  上校想让我们
<7-7,Leonard>Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us

227
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,510
<7-7,Leonard>把导向系统做得更小一点
<7-7,Leonard>to make the guidance system smaller,

228
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,550
<7-7,Leonard>没有你我们做不到
<7-7,Leonard>and we can't do it without you.

229
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,430
<7-8,Sheldon>有意思
<7-8,Sheldon>Interesting.

230
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,920
<7-8,Sheldon>这么说我是正确的
<7-8,Sheldon>Well, so I was right.

231
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,570
<7-9,Howard>快开窗  有人马上要释放婊气了
<7-9,Howard>Open a window. It's about to get smug in here.

232
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,700
<7-10,Sheldon>本来我会很愿意帮助你们
<7-10,Sheldon>Well, I would love to help you,

233
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,040
<7-10,Sheldon>但自从我体会到了
<7-10,Sheldon>but since I discovered the satisfaction

234
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,620
<7-10,Sheldon>动手调适火车头引擎的的满足感
<7-10,Sheldon>of working with my hands on a train engine,

235
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,240
<7-10,Sheldon>我觉得我无法再回去搞理论了
<7-10,Sheldon>I don't think I can go back to theory.

236
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,350
<7-10,Sheldon>现在我是一名工程师了
<7-10,Sheldon>I'm an engineer now.

237
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,640
<7-10,Sheldon>先把话说清楚
<7-10,Sheldon>And, hey, just to be clear,

238
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,070
<7-10,Sheldon>是火车驾驶员[工程师]
<7-10,Sheldon>a train engineer.

239
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,980
<7-10,Sheldon>不是你那种蠢蛋工程师
<7-10,Sheldon>Not that goofy kind you are.

240
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,350
<7-11,Leonard>谢尔顿  你几周后再去旅行也不迟啊
<7-11,Leonard>Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks.

241
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,400
<7-11,Leonard>帮帮我们吧
<7-11,Leonard>Just help us out.

242
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,250
<7-12,Sheldon>抱歉  我得继续研究这个火车头
<7-12,Sheldon>Sorry. I need to work on this engine

243
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,030
<7-12,Sheldon>这样我到铁路站场时才不会看起来像白痴
<7-12,Sheldon>so when I get to the train yard I won't look foolish.

244
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,140
<7-13,Howard>他居然担心自己看起来像白痴
<7-13,Howard>He's worried about looking foolish.

245
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,740
<7-13,Howard>这是何等讽刺啊
<7-13,Howard>That's a Heapin' helpin' of irony right there.

246
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,520
<7-14,Leonard>拜托  你明知道自己不会放弃物理
<7-14,Leonard>Come on, you know you're not leaving physics.

247
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,240
<7-14,Leonard>你这一出到底是为哪般啊
<7-14,Leonard>Why are you doing this?

248
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,810
<7-15,Sheldon>莱纳德  在理论物理的世界里
<7-15,Sheldon>Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics,

249
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,840
<7-15,Sheldon>永远得不到结论  无法证明的东西太多了
<7-15,Sheldon>you never finish; so much is unprovable.

250
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,970
<7-15,Sheldon>但在我学习那本铁路指南的时候
<7-15,Sheldon>But when I was studying that railway guide,

251
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,450
<7-15,Sheldon>是那么真实可触  是那么令人满足
<7-15,Sheldon>it was so tangible and so satisfying

252
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,250
<7-15,Sheldon>和我"咔"一声一拍即合
<7-15,Sheldon>that something just clicked.

253
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,190
<7-15,Sheldon>然后又"嗒"一声
<7-15,Sheldon>Then it clacked.

254
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,550
<7-15,Sheldon>然后"咔嗒  咔嗒"
<7-15,Sheldon>Then it clicked, then it clacked,

255
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,180
<7-15,Sheldon>"咔嗒  咔嗒"  火车来啦
<7-15,Sheldon>click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are.

256
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,060
<8-1,Amy>加州理工的幼儿园给你回复了吗
<8-1,Amy>Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?

257
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,320
<8-2,Bernadette>还没  不过我们会申请很多其他幼儿园
<8-2,Bernadette>Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others

258
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,710
<8-2,Bernadette>不会在一棵树上吊死
<8-2,Bernadette>just to keep our options open.

259
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,510
<8-3,Penny>够了  别再聊幼儿园的事了
<8-3,Penny>Okay, stop that! No more preschool talk.

260
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,340
<8-3,Penny>今晚的重点是玩得开心
<8-3,Penny>Tonight is about having fun.

261
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,610
<8-4,Amy>没什么比被你训更开心了
<8-4,Amy>Nothing says fun like being scolded.

262
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,480
<8-5,Bernadette (phone rings)>是拉杰
<8-5,Bernadette (phone rings)>It's Raj.

263
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,900
<8-5,Bernadette (phone rings)>一切都还好吗
<8-5,Bernadette (phone rings)>Everything okay?

264
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,410
<8-6,Raj>别担心  一切都好
<8-6,Raj>Don't worry. Everything's fine.

265
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,610
<8-7,Stuart>把电话挂了  我们不需要帮助
<8-7,Stuart>Hang up! We don't need help.

266
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,530
<8-8,Raj>我不需要你帮我决定  我们需不需要帮助
<8-8,Raj>I don't need your help deciding when we need help!

267
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,560
<8-9,Bernadette>拉杰  怎么了
<8-9,Bernadette>Raj, what's going on?

268
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,690
<8-10,Raj>是这样的
<8-10,Raj>Yes, so,

269
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,390
<8-10,Raj>我刚刚在帮哈雷热奶
<8-10,Raj>I was just warming up some milk for Halley,

270
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,450
<8-10,Raj>我觉得奶闻起来有点怪味
<8-10,Raj>and I-I thought it smelled a little funky,

271
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,890
<8-10,Raj>所以我看了你写在奶瓶上的日期
<8-10,Raj>so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle,

272
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,550
<8-10,Raj>结果上面写的是"星期囧"
<8-10,Raj>and it says "Flerbsday."

273
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,050
<8-11,Stuart>写的是"星期二"
<8-11,Stuart>It says "Tuesday."

274
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,600
<8-12,Raj>这怎么可能是"二"
<8-12,Raj>How is that a "T"?!

275
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,050
<8-13,Bernadette>我很肯定奶没变质  但如果你担心
<8-13,Bernadette>I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried,

276
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,640
<8-13,Bernadette>冰箱里还有新的
<8-13,Bernadette>there's extra milk in the freezer.

277
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,690
<8-14,Raj>好的好的
<8-14,Raj>Okay, yes,

278
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,030
<8-14,Raj>为了万无一失
<8-14,Raj>I will err on the side of caution

279
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,260
<8-14,Raj>我就解冻新的吧
<8-14,Raj>and defrost a fresh batch.

280
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,850
<8-15,Stuart>你白白浪费了一瓶没变质的奶
<8-15,Stuart>You're wasting perfectly good milk.

281
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,130
<8-16,Raj>-好  那你喝了它  -奶而已我怕什么
<8-16,Raj>- Fine, you drink it. - It's just milk.

282
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,690
<8-18,Bernadette>斯图尔特  不准你喝老娘的奶
<8-18,Bernadette>Stuart, don't you drink my milk!

283
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,130
<8-19,Penny>给我
<8-19,Penny>Okay, give-

284
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,860
<8-19,Penny>你俩到底能不能搞定
<8-19,Penny>Can you guys handle this or not?

285
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,380
<8-20,Raj>我们当然能搞定
<8-20,Raj>Oh, of course we can.

286
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,030
<8-20,Raj>你们几个姑娘玩得开心点
<8-20,Raj>Uh, you girls have a good time.

287
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,120
<8-20,Raj>她说这里我说了算
<8-20,Raj>She said I was in charge.

288
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,220
<8-21,Stuart>所以我们就这么把这瓶奶倒了吗
<8-21,Stuart>So we just throw this away?

289
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,990
<8-22,Raj>不然还能怎么办
<8-22,Raj>What else are you gonna do with it?

290
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,320
<8-22,Raj>加在咖啡里吗
<8-22,Raj>Put it in your coffee?

291
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,870
<8-23,Stuart>我喝咖啡的确加奶啊
<8-23,Stuart>Well, I don't take it black.

292
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,910
<9-1,Leonard>好的  他写在板子上的全部内容都在这了
<9-1,Leonard>Okay. This is everything he had on the board.

293
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,570
<9-1,Leonard>我很肯定我们能补全这个理论
<9-1,Leonard>I'm sure we can figure the rest out.

294
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,740
<9-1,Leonard>好
<9-1,Leonard>All right.

295
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,950
<9-2,Howard>你尽管开口打断我
<9-2,Howard>Feel free to jump in.

296
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,760
<9-2,Howard>我除了哼一声也没啥想法了
<9-2,Howard>"Hmm" is all I got.

297
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,890
<9-3,Leonard>我们能做到
<9-3,Leonard>Oh, we can get this.

298
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,660
<9-3,Leonard>会不会是我把上下弄颠倒了
<9-3,Leonard>Is there any chance it's upside-down?

299
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,630
<9-4,Howard>或许我们可以找其他理论物理学家来帮忙
<9-4,Howard>Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.

300
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,830
<9-5,Leonard>这是机密研究项目
<9-5,Leonard>It's classified.

301
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,510
<9-5,Leonard>如果我们告诉其他人会惹上麻烦的
<9-5,Leonard>If we tell anyone, we'd get in trouble.

302
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,890
<9-6,Howard>至少我想出了这个主意  还哼了一声
<9-6,Howard>Hey, I came up with that and "Hmm."

303
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,970
<9-6,Howard>你屁都没贡献
<9-6,Howard>You haven't pitched anything.

304
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,190
<9-7,Leonard>接着琢磨吧
<9-7,Leonard>Just keep thinking.

305
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,370
<9-7,Leonard>我想到了
<9-7,Leonard>I got it.

306
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,640
<9-8,Howard>你真的琢磨出来了吗
<9-8,Howard>You really figured it out?

307
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
<9-8,Howard>没有
<9-8,Howard>No,

308
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,590
<9-9,Leonard>但只要我们让谢尔顿看到这堆鬼扯
<9-9,Leonard>but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon,

309
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,910
<9-9,Leonard>他会被逼疯  然后会忍不住纠正我们
<9-9,Leonard>it will make him crazy, and he'll have to fix it.

310
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,660
<9-10,Howard>你真是天才
<9-10,Howard>Oh, you're a genius.

311
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,820
<9-11,Leonard>是啊  我知道
<9-11,Leonard>Yeah, I know.

312
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,350
<9-11,Leonard>这个根本连数学符号都不是
<9-11,Leonard>That's not even a math symbol.

313
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,040
<9-11,Leonard>是卡通角色查理·布朗的头发
<9-11,Leonard>That's just Charlie Brown's hair.

314
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,270
<10-1,Penny>抱歉  姑娘们
<10-1,Penny>Sorry, guys.

315
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,820
<10-1,Penny>这间夜店本来很火的
<10-1,Penny>This club was so great.

316
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,760
<10-1,Penny>怎么就改建成书店了呢
<10-1,Penny>How could they turn it into a bookstore?

317
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,320
<10-1,Penny>我还以为人类已经彻底摆脱书店了
<10-1,Penny>I thought we got rid of all those.

318
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,740
<10-2,Amy>现在觉得文艺复兴合唱团听起来挺有趣了吧
<10-2,Amy>Renaissance Choir's looking pretty good right now, huh?

319
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,140
<10-3,Bernadette (on phone)>怎么了
<10-3,Bernadette (on phone)>Hello?

320
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,570
<10-4,Raj>没什么可担心的
<10-4,Raj>Nothing to worry about.

321
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,090
<10-4,Raj>只是她哭了好一阵了
<10-4,Raj>She's just been crying for a little while,

322
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,910
<10-4,Raj>我想知道你有没有什么哄她睡觉的小技巧
<10-4,Raj>and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.

323
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,650
<10-5,Stuart>她本来睡得好好的  你非要和她一起自拍
<10-5,Stuart>She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her!

324
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,130
<10-6,Raj>她吹了个口水泡泡
<10-6,Raj>She was blowing a spit bubble.

325
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,380
<10-6,Raj>那么可爱你让我怎么忍
<10-6,Raj>It was adorable!

326
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,100
<10-7,Bernadette>你们能搞定吗  要不要我回家去
<10-7,Bernadette>You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?

327
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,020
<10-8,Stuart>等一下
<10-8,Stuart>Wait.

328
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,300
<10-8,Stuart>她哭得没那么厉害了
<10-8,Stuart>She's settling down.

329
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,170
<10-9,Raj>没事了  只是误报
<10-9,Raj>Oh, okay, false alarm.

330
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,590
<10-9,Raj>分享一点育儿经验
<10-9,Raj>Little parenting tip:

331
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,360
<10-9,Raj>睡着的宝宝讨厌被人开闪光灯拍照
<10-9,Raj>sleeping babies hate flash photography.

332
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,420
<10-10,Penny>没什么事吧
<10-10,Penny>Is everything okay?

333
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,340
<10-10,Penny>没事
<10-10,Penny>Yeah.

334
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,000
<10-11,Bernadette>我可能把我襁褓中的女儿
<10-11,Bernadette>I may have just left my infant daughter

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,110
<10-11,Bernadette>留给了海绵宝宝和派大星这对活宝
<10-11,Bernadette>with Patrick and SpongeBob.

336
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,220
<10-12,Amy>附近还有另一间夜店
<10-12,Amy>Hey, there's another dance club nearby.

337
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,780
<10-12,Amy>不知道你们是否喜欢拉丁音乐
<10-12,Amy>I mean, I don't know how you feel about Latin music,

338
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,140
<10-12,Amy>但根据他们的营业时间  现在还没关门
<10-12,Amy>but according to their horas of operacion, they're open.

339
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,420
<10-13,Penny>要不今晚到此为止吧
<10-13,Penny>Maybe we should just call it a night.

340
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,270
<10-14,Amy>确定吗  他们两点才关门哦
<10-14,Amy>You sure? They're open till dos.

341
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,040
<10-15,Bernadette>是啊  我们都精心打扮了
<10-15,Bernadette>Yeah, we're all dressed up.

342
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,090
<10-15,Bernadette>回家可惜了
<10-15,Bernadette>Why go home?

343
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,250
<10-16,Penny>我只是没心情了
<10-16,Penny>I'm just not really in the mood anymore.

344
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,650
<10-17,Bernadette>你怎么了
<10-17,Bernadette>What's going on with you?

345
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,310
<10-18,Penny>不知道  只是觉得
<10-18,Penny>I don't know. This is all starting to feel

346
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,800
<10-18,Penny>想抓住青春的尾巴挺伤感的
<10-18,Penny>like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.

347
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,010
<10-20,Amy>我不伤感
<10-20,Amy>I'm not sad.

348
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,340
<10-19,Bernadette>我只想喝醉  不用穿宽松的运动裤
<10-19,Bernadette>I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.

349
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,150
<10-20,Amy>我也不伤感
<10-20,Amy>I'm not sad.

350
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,240
<10-20,Amy>瞧瞧
<10-20,Amy>I mean, hello.

351
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,430
<10-21,Penny>也许是我伤感
<10-21,Penny>Okay, maybe I'm the one who's sad.

352
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,570
<10-22,Amy>你伤感什么呢
<10-22,Amy>What are you sad about?

353
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,370
<10-23,Penny>也许是因为你生了孩子
<10-23,Penny>Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.

354
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,680
<10-24,Bernadette>我生了孩子你不高兴吗
<10-24,Bernadette>You're upset I had a baby?

355
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,610
<10-25,Penny>当然不是  我只是...
<10-25,Penny>No, of course not. I just...

356
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,280
<10-25,Penny>我没想到会让我有这么多的感触
<10-25,Penny>I didn't think it would make me have all these feelings.

357
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,420
<10-26,Amy>什么感触
<10-26,Amy>What feelings?

358
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,850
<10-27,Penny>压力
<10-27,Penny>Pressure!

359
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,930
<10-27,Penny>她在找幼儿园
<10-27,Penny>I mean, she's looking at preschools,

360
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,310
<10-27,Penny>她有厢式车  她有401K[退休账户]
<10-27,Penny>she has a minivan, she has a 401k.

361
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,890
<10-27,Penny>她没解释前  我以为这是一个种族
<10-27,Penny>Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.

362
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,840
<10-28,Bernadette>你觉得这些东西很有趣吗
<10-28,Bernadette>You think that stuff is fun?

363
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,920
<10-28,Bernadette>为人父母令人害怕
<10-28,Bernadette>Being a parent is terrifying.

364
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,560
<10-28,Bernadette>我时时担心  刻刻疲倦
<10-28,Bernadette>I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired,

365
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,460
<10-28,Bernadette>过一会儿  我得在书店的停车场
<10-28,Bernadette>and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself

366
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,320
<10-28,Bernadette>把奶泵出来
<10-28,Bernadette>in a bookstore parking lot.

367
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,060
<10-29,Penny>我明白
<10-29,Penny>I get that, okay?

368
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,990
<10-29,Penny>只是我和莱纳德结婚两年了
<10-29,Penny>It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years,

369
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,400
<10-29,Penny>我们和约会时相比  没有任何进展
<10-29,Penny>and we're no further along than when we were dating.

370
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,960
<10-29,Penny>别这样
<10-29,Penny>Come on.

371
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,570
<10-30,Amy>你有很多值得开心的事
<10-30,Amy>You've got so much to feel good about.

372
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,550
<10-30,Amy>你现在有份好工作
<10-30,Amy>You've got a great job now.

373
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,910
<10-31,Penny>我想我的薪水是还不错
<10-31,Penny>Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.

374
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,670
<10-32,Amy>你赚的钱比我多
<10-32,Amy>You make more than I do.

375
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,560
<10-33,Bernadette>虽说你们还没买房子  但你们的公寓非常棒
<10-33,Bernadette>You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.

376
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,320
<10-34,Amy>比我的公寓大
<10-34,Amy>It's bigger than mine.

377
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,930
<10-35,Bernadette>莱纳德深爱着你  娶了你两次
<10-35,Bernadette>And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.

378
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,470
<10-36,Amy>我连一次订婚经历都没有
<10-36,Amy>I'm not even engaged once.

379
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,410
<10-36,Amy>我甚至不知道谢尔顿是否考虑过婚姻
<10-36,Amy>I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage.

380
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,250
<10-36,Amy>我年纪越来越大了
<10-36,Amy>I'm not getting any younger.

381
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,060
<10-36,Amy>说实话  我现在在想
<10-36,Amy>Honestly, I kind of thought by now,

382
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,320
<10-36,Amy>也许我们...
<10-36,Amy>we might have had some sort of...

383
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,900
<10-37,Bernadette>小心  哭泣声会让我分泌乳汁
<10-37,Bernadette>Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.

384
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,470
<10-38,Amy>对不起  我忍不住
<10-38,Amy>I'm sorry. I can't help it.

385
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,260
<10-39,Penny>这下我也想哭了
<10-39,Penny>Oh, that's gonna make me cry.

386
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,590
<10-40,Bernadette>果然出来了
<10-40,Bernadette>And there they go.

387
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,060
<11-1,Leonard>谢尔顿  原来我们根本不需要你
<11-1,Leonard>Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn't need you after all.

388
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,000
<11-2,Howard>没错  我们自己解决了
<11-2,Howard>That's right. We figured it out all by ourselves.

389
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,220
<11-2,Howard>也没那么难
<11-2,Howard>Wasn't even that hard.

390
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,890
<11-4,Sheldon>两位真厉害
<11-4,Sheldon>Well, good for you guys.

391
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,730
<11-4,Sheldon>看  我手上有油污  但我都不在乎
<11-4,Sheldon>Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I'm okay with it.

392
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,310
<11-5,Leonard>你不看看白板吗  看我们多正确
<11-5,Leonard>Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?

393
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,120
<11-6,Sheldon>不用  多谢  我忙着修这个燃油泵
<11-6,Sheldon>No, thanks. I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.

394
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,860
<11-7,Howard>那是歧管
<11-7,Howard>It's a manifold.

395
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,350
<11-8,Sheldon>那看来修好了
<11-8,Sheldon>Well, I guess it's fixed.

396
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,340
<11-9,Leonard>快看下白板
<11-9,Leonard>Just look at the board.

397
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,710
<11-10,Sheldon>错了
<11-10,Sheldon>That's wrong.

398
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,250
<11-11,Leonard>不是吧
<11-11,Leonard>Oh, no!

399
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,430
<11-11,Leonard>那要怎么改正呢
<11-11,Leonard>What should we have done differently?

400
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,910
<11-12,Sheldon>首先  在同一方程中
<11-12,Sheldon>Well, first of all, you can't use relativistic

401
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,870
<11-12,Sheldon>不能使用相对和非相对向量
<11-12,Sheldon>and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.

402
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,350
<11-13,Howard>跟你说过了
<11-13,Howard>Told ya.

403
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,910
<11-13,Howard>你能纠正我们吗
<11-13,Howard>Can you fix it for us?

404
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,610
<11-14,Sheldon>好  但是下不为例
<11-14,Sheldon>Okay, but this is the last time.

405
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,100
<11-14,Sheldon>小瞧哥了  蠢货
<11-14,Sheldon>Nice try, blockheads.

406
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,410
<11-15,Leonard>拜托  谢尔顿  你不能就这样放弃物理
<11-15,Leonard>Come on, Sheldon. You can't turn your back on physics.

407
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,530
<11-15,Leonard>而且你根本不知道你在捣鼓些什么
<11-15,Leonard>Besides, you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff.

408
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,500
<11-16,Howard>如果你真想学机械方面的知识
<11-16,Howard>But if you really want to learn the mechanical side,

409
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,010
<11-16,Howard>你想知道的  我都能教你
<11-16,Howard>I can teach you anything you want to know.

410
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,030
<11-17,Leonard>与其站着傻看
<11-17,Leonard>And instead of standing around watching,

411
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,440
<11-17,Leonard>你不如帮我们创建更小的导向系统
<11-17,Leonard>you can help us build your smaller guidance system.

412
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,880
<11-18,Howard>有了新的技能
<11-18,Howard>And with all these new skills,

413
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,360
<11-18,Howard>你可以修好任何火车模型
<11-18,Howard>you'd be able to fix any model train.

414
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,990
<11-18,Howard>你将成为火车模型店之王
<11-18,Howard>You'd be the king of the train store!

415
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,880
<11-19,Sheldon>不好意思  哥有女朋友
<11-19,Sheldon>Excuse me. I have a girlfriend.

416
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,590
<11-19,Sheldon>哥已经是火车模型店之王了
<11-19,Sheldon>I'm already king of the train store.

417
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,440
<11-20,Leonard>怎么样
<11-20,Leonard>So, what do you say?

418
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,650
<11-21,Sheldon>我能有什么选择  你们需要我
<11-21,Sheldon>Oh, what choice do I have? You need me.

419
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,100
<11-21,Sheldon>我就像这个团队的曲轴
<11-21,Sheldon>I'm like the crankshaft of this team.

420
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,310
<11-22,Howard>那是涡轮增压机
<11-22,Howard>That's a turbo.

421
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,380
<11-23,Sheldon>无论是什么  看起来很沉
<11-23,Sheldon>Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.

422
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,460
<11-23,Sheldon>你们两个在艾米回家前把它抬楼下去
<11-23,Sheldon>I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.

423
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,130
<12-1,Sheldon>抱歉这里这么热
<12-1,Sheldon>I apologize that it's so warm in here.

424
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,560
<12-2,Amy>的确很热
<12-2,Amy>It is warm in here.

425
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,140
<12-3,Sheldon>我都流汗了
<12-3,Sheldon>I've worked up a bit of a sweat.

426
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,730
<12-4,Amy>我也是
<12-4,Amy>Me, too.

427
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,360
<12-5,Sheldon>水能给我吗
<12-5,Sheldon>May I borrow your water?

428
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,610
<12-5,Sheldon>* 大爷在此 *
<12-5,Sheldon>* Here I am *

430
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,120
<12-5,Sheldon>* 像飓风般震撼你 *
<12-5,Sheldon>* Rock you like a hurricane *

431
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,650
<12-6,Sheldon (voice)>* 大爷在此 *
<12-6,Sheldon (voice)>* Here I am *

432
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,830
<12-6,Sheldon (voice)>* 像飓风般震撼你 *
<12-6,Sheldon (voice)>* Rock you like a hurricane *

433
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,230
<12-6,Sheldon (voice)>绿灯了
<12-6,Sheldon (voice)>The light's green.

434
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,160
<12-7,Amy (now in her car)>对不起
<12-7,Amy (now in her car)>Sorry.

435
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,490
<12-8,Sheldon>导航说还有三小时就到铁路了
<12-8,Sheldon>GPS says we'll be at the railway in three hours.

436
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,830
<12-9,Amy>我能在两小时内开到
<12-9,Amy>I can get us there in two.
