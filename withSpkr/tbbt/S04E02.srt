1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,200
<1-1,Leonard>在干嘛呢
<1-1,Leonard>Whatcha doin' there?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,100
<1-1,Leonard>研究抓哔哔鸟的新方法吗
<1-1,Leonard>Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,940
<1-2,Sheldon>你这个幽默暗指我是大笨狼怀尔吗
<1-2,Sheldon>The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,300
<1-3,Leonard>没错
<1-3,Leonard>Yes.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,970
<1-4,Sheldon>而板上画的捕鸟设备
<1-4,Sheldon>And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,940
<1-4,Sheldon>最终只会适得其反  让我受伤吗
<1-4,Sheldon>that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,010
<1-5,Leonard>没错
<1-5,Leonard>Yes.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,850
<1-6,Sheldon>我正在做的
<1-6,Sheldon>What I'm doing here

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,190
<1-6,Sheldon>是想计算出我的死亡时间
<1-6,Sheldon>is trying to determine when I'm going to die.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,690
<1-7,Leonard>很多人都在做这方面的研究
<1-7,Leonard>A lot of people are working on that research.

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,430
<1-7,Leonard>那这些是什么
<1-7,Leonard>So what is all this?

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,330
<1-8,Sheldon>我家人的寿命长短
<1-8,Sheldon>My family history factoring in longevity

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,730
<1-8,Sheldon>疾病倾向等信息
<1-8,Sheldon>propensity for disease, et cetera.

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,800
<1-9,Leonard>有意思
<1-9,Leonard>Interesting.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,000
<1-9,Leonard>卡尔叔叔的死因是KBB
<1-9,Leonard>Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,040
<1-9,Leonard>KBB是什么
<1-9,Leonard>What's "KBB"?

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,370
<1-10,Sheldon>被獾所杀
<1-10,Sheldon>"Killed by badger."

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,110
<1-11,Leonard>怎么回事
<1-11,Leonard>How's that?

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,180
<1-12,Sheldon>那是感恩节
<1-12,Sheldon>It was Thanksgiving.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,810
<1-12,Sheldon>卡尔叔叔说"我觉得有只獾住在咱家烟囱里"
<1-12,Sheldon>Uncle Carl said, "I think there's a badger living in our chimney. "

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,720
<1-12,Sheldon>"把手电筒给我"
<1-12,Sheldon>"Hand me that flashlight."

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,950
<1-12,Sheldon>那是他对我们说的最后几句话
<1-12,Sheldon>Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,350
<1-13,Leonard>我觉得
<1-13,Leonard>I don't think you need

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,360
<1-13,Leonard>你没必要担心被獾所杀会遗传
<1-13,Leonard>to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,830
<1-14,Sheldon>不对
<1-14,Sheldon>Not true.

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,530
<1-14,Sheldon>战斗或逃跑的本能受基因控制
<1-14,Sheldon>The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically.

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,530
<1-14,Sheldon>他没选择逃跑  反而赤手空拳
<1-14,Sheldon>Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,200
<1-14,Sheldon>跟鼬类动物中强壮的一员战斗
<1-14,Sheldon>against a brawny member of the weasel family.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,440
<1-14,Sheldon>谁能肯定我没遗传这种有缺陷的基因
<1-14,Sheldon>Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA?

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,010
<1-15,Leonard>你反正可以找只獾来验证的
<1-15,Leonard>You can always get a badger and find out.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,650
<1-16,Sheldon>说实在的
<1-16,Sheldon>But seriously

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,280
<1-16,Sheldon>即使我忽略卡尔叔叔这个因素
<1-16,Sheldon>even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,750
<1-16,Sheldon>我最多也只剩60年寿命
<1-16,Sheldon>at best I have 60 years left.

34
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,350
<1-17,Leonard>还有那么长啊
<1-17,Leonard>That long, huh?

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,020
<1-18,Sheldon>60年我只能活到这里
<1-18,Sheldon>60 only takes me to here.

36
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,190
<1-18,Sheldon>我要活到这里
<1-18,Sheldon>I need to get to here.

37
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,060
<1-19,Leonard>那里有什么
<1-19,Leonard>What's there?

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,830
<1-20,Sheldon>据预计奇点最早出现的时间
<1-20,Sheldon>The earliest estimate of the singularity

39
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,060
<1-20,Sheldon>人们能将自己的意识
<1-20,Sheldon>when man will be able to transfer his consciousness

40
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,770
<1-20,Sheldon>转移进机器而获得永生
<1-20,Sheldon>into machines and achieve immortality.

41
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,200
<1-21,Leonard>这么说  你不高兴自己会错失
<1-21,Leonard>So, you're upset about missing out

42
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,910
<1-21,Leonard>变成某种怪异的有自我意识的机器人的机会
<1-21,Leonard>on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?

43
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,940
<1-22,Sheldon>就差这么一点啊
<1-22,Sheldon>By this much.

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,210
<1-23,Leonard>真可惜  你要吃鸡蛋吗
<1-23,Leonard>Tough break.  You want eggs?

45
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,980
<1-24,Sheldon>你不明白  莱纳德
<1-24,Sheldon>You don't get it, Leonard.

46
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,580
<1-24,Sheldon>我会错过很多东西
<1-24,Sheldon>I'm going to miss so much.

47
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,120
<1-24,Sheldon>统一场论  冷聚变  还有章狗
<1-24,Sheldon>the unified field theory, cold fusion, the dogapus.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,720
<1-25,Leonard>章狗是什么
<1-25,Leonard>What's a dogapus?

49
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,930
<1-26,Sheldon>狗和章鱼的杂交动物
<1-26,Sheldon>The hybrid dog and octopus.

50
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,900
<1-26,Sheldon>人类在水下的忠实朋友
<1-26,Sheldon>Man's underwater best friend.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,470
<1-27,Leonard>有人研究这个吗
<1-27,Leonard>Is somebody working on that?

52
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,730
<1-28,Sheldon>我打算过研究的
<1-28,Sheldon>I was going to.

53
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,410
<1-28,Sheldon>我想把它作为我三百岁的生日礼物
<1-28,Sheldon>I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.

54
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,470
<1-29,Leonard>等等  你讨厌狗
<1-29,Leonard>Wait a minute. You hate dogs.

55
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,810
<1-30,Sheldon>章狗玩接球时能接八个球
<1-30,Sheldon>A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls.

56
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,480
<1-30,Sheldon>没有人能讨厌这个
<1-30,Sheldon>No one can hate that.

57
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,890
<1-30,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-30,Sheldon>第四季第二集

58
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,290
<2-1,Howard>我们欠你多少钱
<2-1,Howard>What do we owe you?

<2-2,Leonard>一共是28.17美元
<2-2,Leonard>It came to $28.17.

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,890
<2-2,Leonard>每人就六美元吧
<2-2,Leonard>Let's say six bucks apiece.

61
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,660
<2-3,Howard>给你
<2-3,Howard>Here you go.

65
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,870
<2-7,Penny>你要我给钱啊
<2-7,Penny>Oh, you wanted me to pay.

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,100
<2-8,Leonard>-不用了  -不不不  你是对的
<2-8,Leonard>- It's no big deal. - No, no, no, no. You're right.

67
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,540
<2-9,Penny>我们已经分手了  我应该自己付钱
<2-9,Penny>We're not going out anymore; I should pay for myself.

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,510
<2-9,Penny>笑什么
<2-9,Penny>What?

69
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,810
<2-10,Howard>他说"如果他有女人身子"
<2-10,Howard>He said, "If he had woman parts

70
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,420
<2-10,Howard>"他后半辈子就不愁吃了"
<2-10,Howard>"he'd eat for free the rest of his life"

71
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,590
<2-11,Penny>是啊  可你也没办法跟自己说话了
<2-11,Penny>Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself.

72
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,220
<2-11,Penny>我现金有点紧张啊
<2-11,Penny>I'm a little low on cash.

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,330
<2-12,Leonard>-你有多少  -没有
<2-12,Leonard>- How much you got?  - Nothing.

74
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,860
<2-14,Leonard>你不带钱怎么出门啊
<2-14,Leonard>How can you walk around with no money?

75
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,500
<2-15,Penny>我漂亮  别人请客
<2-15,Penny>I'm cute. I get by.

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,260
<2-16,Leonard>没事  欠着吧
<2-16,Leonard>It's okay, you can owe me.

<2-18,Leonard>-谢谢  -谢尔顿  六美元
<2-18,Leonard>- Thank you.  - Sheldon, six bucks.

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,270
<2-19,Sheldon>不了  谢谢  我今晚不吃披萨
<2-19,Sheldon>No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.

79
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,370
<2-20,Penny>可今天是星期四
<2-20,Penny>But it's Thursday.

80
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,010
<2-20,Penny>星期四是披萨之夜
<2-20,Penny>Thursday's pizza night.

81
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,110
<2-21,Sheldon>对我来说不是
<2-21,Sheldon>Not for me.

82
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,180
<2-21,Sheldon>现在改成十字花科蔬菜之夜了
<2-21,Sheldon>Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,550
<2-21,Sheldon>今晚的特选  小包菜
<2-21,Sheldon>Tonight's selection: Brussels sprouts.

84
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,680
<2-22,Howard>真的吗
<2-22,Howard>Really?

85
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,380
<2-22,Howard>你要改谢尔顿日程表
<2-22,Howard>You're changing the Sheldonian calendar?

86
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,490
<2-23,Sheldon>-这只是个小小的代价  -为啥
<2-23,Sheldon>- It's a small price to pay. - For what?

87
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,020
<2-26,Penny>-不  别问啊  -对不起
<2-26,Penny>- No, no, don't ask. - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

88
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,360
<2-27,Sheldon>为了把我的寿命延长到能把意识
<2-27,Sheldon>In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness

89
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,960
<2-27,Sheldon>转移到人造大脑上  我要改变饮食
<2-27,Sheldon>with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,230
<2-28,Penny>等等  人造大脑是机器人之类的吧
<2-28,Penny>Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?

91
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,200
<2-29,Sheldon>没错
<2-29,Sheldon>Correct.

92
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,700
<2-30,Penny>这么说你想把自己变成某种机器人
<2-30,Penny>So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?

93
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,900
<2-31,Sheldon>本质上是这样
<2-31,Sheldon>Essentially, yes.

94
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,170
<2-32,Penny>我想问个问题
<2-32,Penny>Okay, here's my question.

95
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,600
<2-32,Penny>你不是已经变成机器人了吗
<2-32,Penny>Didn't you already do that?

96
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,580
<2-33,Sheldon>虽然我受宠若惊  可惜还没有
<2-33,Sheldon>Flattering, but sadly, no.

97
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,050
<2-33,Sheldon>我还打算开始一种运动养生法
<2-33,Sheldon>I'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen

98
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,480
<2-33,Sheldon>加强我的心血管系统
<2-33,Sheldon>designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system.

99
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,750
<2-33,Sheldon>也就是慢跑
<2-33,Sheldon>AKA jogging.

100
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,320
<2-34,Penny>等等  亲爱的  你以前跑过步吗
<2-34,Penny>Wait. Honey, have you ever run before?

101
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,620
<6-5,Leonard>当然跑过
<6-5,Leonard>Certainly.

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,830
<2-35,Sheldon>我被恶霸  狗和暴走的鸡追过
<2-35,Sheldon>I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens...

103
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,460
<2-35,Sheldon>还有个锲而不舍执意要给我做
<2-35,Sheldon>and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher

104
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,730
<2-35,Sheldon>脊柱侧弯测试的体育老师
<2-35,Sheldon>determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.

105
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,840
<2-36,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>你说得对  佩妮经常跑步
<2-36,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>You're right. Penny jogs.

106
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,410
<2-36,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>你们可以一起跑的
<2-36,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>Maybe you guys can run together.

107
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,770
<2-37,Sheldon>这主意太棒了
<2-37,Sheldon>That's an excellent idea.

108
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,510
<2-37,Sheldon>如果我们边跑边聊
<2-37,Sheldon>Yeah, if we chat

109
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,750
<2-37,Sheldon>就会感觉时间流逝得更快了
<2-37,Sheldon>it will create the illusion of time going faster.

110
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,750
<2-38,Penny>绝对不可能
<2-38,Penny>No, it won't.

111
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,990
<2-38,Penny>他怎么知道我跑步的
<2-38,Penny>Um, how does he know I jog?

112
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,260
<2-39,Howard>因为他在车里用高倍望远镜尾行你
<2-39,Howard>Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.

113
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,130
<2-40,Penny>我的天呐  这太猥琐了
<2-40,Penny>Oh, my God, that is so creepy!

114
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,790
<2-40,Penny>我就说嘛
<2-40,Penny>I know!

115
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,500
<2-41,Howard>他说他要坚持发扬下去
<2-41,Howard>And he says he's not gonna stop.

116
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,140
<2-41,Howard>那找心理医生解决怎么和女人说话的问题啊
<2-41,Howard>Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.

117
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,250
<3-2,Leonard>什么玩意儿
<3-2,Leonard>What the hell?

118
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,590
<3-2,Leonard>怎么了
<3-2,Leonard>What's the matter?

119
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,630
<3-3,Sheldon>疼痛以我的肚脐为起点
<3-3,Sheldon>I have pain radiating from my navel

120
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,460
<3-3,Sheldon>延伸到我的右下腹
<3-3,Sheldon>to my lower right abdomen.

121
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,560
<3-3,Sheldon>我感到恶心和发热
<3-3,Sheldon>I'm nauseated and feverish.

122
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,430
<3-3,Sheldon>我觉得我得霍乱了
<3-3,Sheldon>I believe I may have cholera.

123
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,770
<3-4,Leonard>帕萨迪纳才没霍乱呢
<3-4,Leonard>There's no cholera in Pasadena.

124
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,870
<3-4,Leonard>就跟去年夏天帕萨迪纳也没有疟疾一样
<3-4,Leonard>Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.

125
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,240
<3-5,Sheldon>好吧  如果那不是霍乱
<3-5,Sheldon>Well, if it's not cholera

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,140
<3-5,Sheldon>根据搜索结果
<3-5,Sheldon>then based on a quick Internet search

127
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,010
<3-5,Sheldon>由相似度递减排列的其他解释分别是
<3-5,Sheldon>the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood

128
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,880
<3-5,Sheldon>先天性巨结肠  肉毒杆菌中毒  一条30英尺长的绦虫
<3-5,Sheldon>are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm

129
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,790
<3-5,Sheldon>或者是不小心摄入菊花
<3-5,Sheldon>or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.

130
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,590
<3-6,Leonard>你什么时候会不小心摄入菊花的
<3-6,Leonard>When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?

131
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,190
<3-7,Sheldon>这是包括了梦游
<3-7,Sheldon>It's part of an unlikely scenario

132
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,830
<3-7,Sheldon>和24小时营业的花店
<3-7,Sheldon>that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart

133
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,060
<3-7,Sheldon>以及不靠谱的经营者的不可能场景
<3-7,Sheldon>with a less-than- vigilant proprietor.

134
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,500
<3-7,Sheldon>噢  老天  我的肚子
<3-7,Sheldon>Oh, Lord, my belly!

135
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,370
<3-8,Leonard>你切除过阑尾吗
<3-8,Leonard>Ever had your appendix out?

136
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,600
<3-8,Leonard>没有
<3-8,Leonard>I haven't.

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,070
<3-9,Sheldon>我想来着  但谁有那时间啊
<3-9,Sheldon>I've been meaning to, but who has the time?

138
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,640
<3-10,Leonard>我送你去医院吧
<3-10,Leonard>Let's get you to the hospital.

139
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,840
<3-11,Sheldon>于是乎就此了结
<3-11,Sheldon>So this is how it ends...

140
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,980
<3-11,Sheldon>真是无比残酷的讽刺
<3-11,Sheldon>with cruel irony.

141
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,280
<3-11,Sheldon>正当我保证要保护爱惜自己的身体之时
<3-11,Sheldon>Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body

142
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,820
<3-11,Sheldon>我被自己的阑尾所背叛  就一退化的器官
<3-11,Sheldon>I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ.

143
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,290
<3-11,Sheldon>你知道阑尾原本的作用是什么吗  莱纳德
<3-11,Sheldon>Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?

144
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,390
<3-12,Leonard>不知道
<3-12,Leonard>No.

145
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,260
<3-13,Sheldon>我知道  而知道太多的却灭亡而你却能继续活下去
<3-13,Sheldon>I do. And yet I'm doomed while you live on.

146
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,430
<3-14,Leonard>结局很出乎意料  是不是
<3-14,Leonard>Funny how things work out, isn't it?

147
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,140
<3-15,Sheldon>噢  天呐  我感觉要爆炸了
<3-15,Sheldon>Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst!

148
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,210
<3-15,Sheldon>还有种可能
<3-15,Sheldon>On the other hand

149
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,940
<3-15,Sheldon>也许都是小包菜的错
<3-15,Sheldon>it might have been the Brussels sprouts.

150
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,480
<3-16,Leonard>晚安您呐
<3-16,Leonard>Good night.

151
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,780
<3-16,Leonard>晚安
<3-16,Leonard>Good night.

152
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,380
<3-17,Sheldon>阑尾炎
<3-17,Sheldon>Appendicitis.

153
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,090
<3-17,Sheldon>自己紧张个甚啊
<3-17,Sheldon>What a nervous Nelly.

154
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,460
<4-1,Sheldon>佩妮  佩妮  佩妮

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,400
<4-3,Sheldon>这是我娘的
<4-3,Sheldon>They're my mother's.

159
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,940
<4-4,Penny>闪电侠T恤是什么意思
<4-4,Penny>Oh. And the Flash shirt is what?

160
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
<4-4,Penny>你要跑的飞快吗
<4-4,Penny>Because, what, you're gonna run really fast?

161
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,670
<4-5,Sheldon>不是  穿闪电侠衫是因为今天是星期五
<4-5,Sheldon>No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday

162
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,140
<4-5,Sheldon>但要是真能有效就更好了
<4-5,Sheldon>but it's nice when things work out.

163
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,240
<4-5,Sheldon>-你的心率监测器在哪儿  -没有
<4-5,Sheldon>- Where's your heart rate monitor?  - I don't have one.

167
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,920
<4-11,Sheldon>就出去像兔子一样随便蹦蹦跳跳一下吗
<4-11,Sheldon>You just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?

168
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,530
<4-12,Penny>不  也就跑到饿了  然后买个熊爪包吃
<4-12,Penny>No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.

169
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,260
<4-13,Sheldon>为什么要这么做
<4-13,Sheldon>Why are you doing that?

170
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,900
<4-14,Penny>在跑步前最好拉伸下肌肉
<4-14,Penny>It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.

171
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,170
<4-15,Sheldon>好吧

212
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,900
<5-18,Sheldon-bot>鉴于近来发生的事
<5-18,Sheldon-bot>Recent events

213
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,340
<5-18,Sheldon-bot>我意识到我的肉身太过脆弱

<5-18,Sheldon-bot>承受不了大千世界的种种
<5-18,Sheldon-bot>to endure the vicissitudes of the world.

215
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,310
<5-18,Sheldon-bot>因此  在我能够
<5-18,Sheldon-bot>Until such time as I am able

216
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,740
<5-18,Sheldon-bot>转移意识之前

<5-19,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>没搞错吧  你就想问这个--
<5-19,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>Really? That's your question--

222
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,820
<5-20,Sheldon-bot>可能一开始感觉会有点怪
<5-20,Sheldon-bot>This may seem a little odd at first

223
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,460
<5-20,Sheldon-bot>但时间久了  你们就会渐渐习惯
<5-20,Sheldon-bot>but over time, you'll grow accustomed

224
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,760
<5-20,Sheldon-bot>和这样的我打交道
<5-20,Sheldon-bot>to dealing with me in this configuration.

225
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,660
<5-21,Penny>是咩  说实话  我觉得没什么不同
<5-21,Penny>Yeah, to be honest, I don't see much difference.

226
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,860

228
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,770
<5-22,Sheldon-bot>那个  莱纳德  明天我们去上班时
<5-22,Sheldon-bot>Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work

229
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,740
<5-22,Sheldon-bot>你得腾出点时间来
<5-22,Sheldon-bot>you'll need to allow some extra time

230
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,540
<5-22,Sheldon-bot>把我搬下楼梯
<5-22,Sheldon-bot>to get me down the stairs.

231
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,210
<5-22,Sheldon-bot>为了让你省力  我会分解成四个部分
<5-22,Sheldon-bot>For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.

232
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,250
<6-1,Leonard>这太荒唐了
<6-1,Leonard>This is ridiculous.

233
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,420
<5-23,Leonard>我要去找你谈谈
<5-23,Leonard>I'm coming to talk to you.

234
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,720
<5-24,Sheldon-bot>你不知道我在哪儿
<5-24,Sheldon-bot>You don't know where I am.

235
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,760
<5-24,Sheldon-bot>我的肉身现被安置在

251
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,260
<6-3,Leonard>不  你没有

252
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,730
<6-4,Sheldon>无视床上的那个人
<6-4,Sheldon>Pay no attention to that man in the bed.

253
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,770
<6-5,Leonard>你不能以这种方式存在于这世上
<6-5,Leonard>You cannot exist as a virtual presence.

<6-5,Leonard>这儿不行  工作时就更不行了
<6-5,Leonard>Not here and certainly not at work.

<6-6,Sheldon>你知不知道  我这年纪的人
<6-6,Sheldon>At my age, do you know

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,940
<6-6,Sheldon>统计数字上最可能怎么死吗
<6-6,Sheldon>how I'm statistically most likely to die?

258
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,210
<6-7,Leonard>被你室友做掉吗
<6-7,Leonard>At the hands of your roommate?

259
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,780
<6-8,Sheldon>死于一场意外
<6-8,Sheldon>An accident.

260
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,250
<6-9,Leonard>我就准备弄成像是一场意外
<6-9,Leonard>That's how I'm going to make it look.

261
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,890
<6-10,Sheldon>在我将自己的智慧
<6-10,Sheldon>Until I can transfer my intellect

262
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,190
<6-10,Sheldon>转移到一个更持久的容器内之前

<6-10,Sheldon>我的肉身将被安全安置在我的床上
<6-10,Sheldon>my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,590
<6-12,Sheldon>你必须帮我  室友协议里写了
<6-12,Sheldon>You have to help-- it's in the roommate agreement.

266
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,100
<6-13,Leonard>不  才没有
<6-13,Leonard>No, it's not.

267
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,430
<6-14,Sheldon>74条C款

<6-14,Sheldon>另一人所应尽的各项义务和责任
<6-14,Sheldon>in the event one of them becomes a robot.

270
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,240
<6-15,Leonard>让我一头撞死好了
<6-15,Leonard>I'll be damned.

271
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,420
<7-1,Sheldon-bot>这种感觉太赞了
<7-1,Sheldon-bot>This is delightful.

272
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
<7-2,Leonard>哼哼
<7-2,Leonard>Uh-huh.

273
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,690
<7-3,Sheldon-bot>不用担心死于车祸
<7-3,Sheldon-bot>It's much easier to enjoy

274
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,700
<7-3,Sheldon-bot>这样在上班路中欣赏美景
<7-3,Sheldon-bot>the picturesque route we travel to work

275
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,930
<7-3,Sheldon-bot>就更加怡然自得了
<7-3,Sheldon-bot>when you remove the specter of fiery vehicular death.

276
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,200
<7-4,Leonard>提醒我下
<7-4,Leonard>Refresh my memory.

277
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,800
<7-4,Leonard>我干嘛不直接把你塞进后备箱呢
<7-4,Leonard>Why didn't I just put you in the trunk?

278
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,770
<7-5,Sheldon-bot>因为我先抢了前排座位  记得不
<7-5,Sheldon-bot>Because I called shotgun. Remember?

279
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,440
<7-6,Leonard>好吧
<7-6,Leonard>Right.

280
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,780
<7-7,Sheldon-bot>你看着压力很大
<7-7,Sheldon-bot>You seem tense.

281
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,480
<7-7,Sheldon-bot>这样会不会感到放松
<7-7,Sheldon-bot>Perhaps this will relax you.

282
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,630
<7-8,Leonard>我不想听音乐  谢尔顿
<7-8,Leonard>I don't want to listen to music, Sheldon.

283
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,230
<7-9,Sheldon-bot>好吧
<7-9,Sheldon-bot>Very well.

284
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,140
<7-9,Sheldon-bot>真不明白你为什么不喜欢这样
<7-9,Sheldon-bot>I don't understand why you're not enjoying this.

285
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,670
<7-9,Sheldon-bot>你和增强功能的我  一起在车里
<7-9,Sheldon-bot>Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities

286
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,210
<7-12,Leonard>这就好比霹雳游侠嘛
<7-12,Leonard>we're like Knight Rider.

288
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,010
<7-10,Leonard>那里面的车可不是括约肌吱吱响的废柴
<7-10,Leonard>Except in Knight Rider, the car isn't a yammering sphincter.

289
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,950
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>你居然嘲笑括约肌
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>You mock the sphincter

290
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,720
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>括约肌可是人体的一组肌肉
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>but the sphincter is a class of muscle

291
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,190
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>没有的话人类没法存活的哦
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>without which human beings couldn't survive.

292
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,530
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>人体内共有超过50种
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>There are over 50 different sphincters

293
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,200
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>不同的括约肌
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>in the human body.

294
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,560
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>你能叫出多少
<7-11,Sheldon-bot>How many can you name?

295
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,470
<7-12,Leonard>我错了  这就是一霹雳游侠  没说的
<7-12,Leonard>I was wrong-- this is exactly like Knight Rider.

296
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
<7-13,Sheldon-bot>你大概会对另一个游戏感兴趣
<7-13,Sheldon-bot>Perhaps you'd be interested in a different game.

297
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,070
<7-14,Leonard>没兴趣
<7-14,Leonard>No.

298

<7-15,Sheldon-bot>这张照片  是在1911年
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>This is a photograph of the 1911

<7-15,Sheldon-bot>召开的辐射和量子理论索尔瓦会议
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta.

300
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,580
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>我PS了几处不该存在的东西
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>Using Photoshop, I've introduced a few anachronisms.

301
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,950
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>看看你能不能找出所有24处
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>See if you can spot all 24.

302
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,450
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>我先给你第一个提示好了
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>I'll give you the first one.

303
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,760
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>居里夫人不该带着电子表
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch.

304
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,130
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>你继续吧
<7-15,Sheldon-bot>And go.

306
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
<7-16,Leonard>够了  拜拜
<7-16,Leonard>That's it. Bye-bye.

307
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,130
<7-17,Sheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on)>吓死你
<7-17,Sheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on)>Bazinga.

<7-19,Sheldon-bot>我有更高权限的开关
<7-19,Sheldon-bot>I have an override switch.

309
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,140
<7-20,Leonard>我差点被你害死了
<7-20,Leonard>I almost died!

310
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,640
<7-21,Sheldon-bot >而我仍安然无恙地坐在床上
<7-21,Sheldon-bot >And I'm safe and sound in bed.

311
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,810
<7-21,Sheldon-bot >现在再看谁是疯子
<7-21,Sheldon-bot >Who's crazy now?

312
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,510
<7-22,Leonard>我还是会说你
<7-22,Leonard>I'm still going to go with you.

<8-1,Sheldon-bot >很遗憾那帮瑞典佬推翻了你的理论
<8-1,Sheldon-bot >Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory.

317
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
<8-1,Sheldon-bot >莱纳德  我的门
<8-1,Sheldon-bot >Leonard, my door.

318
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,970
<8-2,Leonard>你的门怎么了
<8-2,Leonard>What about it?

<8-5,Sheldon-bot >你以为你难住我了  对吗
<8-5,Sheldon-bot >You think you have me stymied, don't you?
