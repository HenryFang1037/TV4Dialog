1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,200
<1-1,Howard>好险
<1-1,Howard>That was close,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,080
<1-2,Raj>我太喜欢清晨彩弹的味道了
<1-2,Raj>God,I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,600
<1-3,Howard>还是很搞笑  拉杰
<1-3,Howard>Yeah,still finny,Raj.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,740
<1-4,Leonard>没办法去山脊了
<1-4,Leonard>There's no way we can get to the ridge.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,990
<1-4,Leonard>化学部的人完全把我们堵死了
<1-4,Leonard>The chemistry department has us completely cut off.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,500
<1-5,Howard>河床呢
<1-5,Howard>But what about the creek bed?

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,600
<1-6,Sheldon>被药理学部门拿下了
<1-6,Sheldon>The pharmacology department controls that,

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,330
<1-6,Sheldon>他们全都吃了兴奋剂
<1-6,Sheldon>And they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,460
<1-7,Raj>完了  我们死定了
<1-7,Raj>That's it then. we're doomed.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,790
<1-8,Sheldon>现在该承认我们会沦落至此
<1-8,Sheldon>I think the time has come to acknowledge that

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,270
<1-8,Sheldon>就是因为某人没参加
<1-8,Sheldon>we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,600
<1-8,Sheldon>我的物理学部门战略会议
<1-8,Sheldon>Physics department paintball strategy meeting.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,830
<1-9,Howard>我说了  我妈妈得了微血管扩张
<1-9,Howard>I told you my mom has spider veins.

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,830
<1-9,Howard>我要带她去激光治疗
<1-9,Howard>I had to take her to the laser clinic.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,030
<1-10,Sheldon>我也跟你说了  我要看医嘱
<1-10,Sheldon>And I told you I wanted to see a doctor's note.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,800
<1-11,Raj>我们要定个策略
<1-11,Raj>We need a plan.

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,560
<1-11,Raj>-"上帝之锤"怎么样  -我忘了
<1-11,Raj>How about operation hammer of the gods? I forget.

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,730
<1-12,Leonard>哪个是"上帝之锤"
<1-12,Leonard>Which one is hammer of the gods?

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,680
<1-13,Raj>我们藏到停车场的垃圾桶后面
<1-13,Raj>We hide behind the dumpsters in the parking

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,660
<1-13,Raj>伏击去尿尿的人
<1-13,Raj>Lot and ambush people when they come to pee.

21
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,400
<1-14,Howard>不行
<1-14,Howard>No go.

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,760
<1-14,Howard>垃圾桶那边完全是天文学部门的领地
<1-14,Howard>The dumpsters are deep in astronomy department territory.

23
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,960
<1-15,Leonard>应该不成问题
<1-15,Leonard>That shouldn't be a problem.

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,460
<1-15,Leonard>金星白天都显现
<1-15,Leonard>Venus is up during the day.

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,560
<1-15,Leonard>他们估计都在望天呢
<1-15,Leonard>They're probably just all staring at the sky.

26
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,330
<1-16,Sheldon>行了  我们现在要战术性撤退
<1-16,Sheldon>All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat.

27
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,200
<1-16,Sheldon>你们看了那集《星际之门》吗
<1-16,Sheldon>Did you see the episode of stargate

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,810
<1-16,Sheldon>他们在一个
<1-16,Sheldon>where they found themselves on a planet

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,820
<1-16,Sheldon>类似雅典和斯巴达文明的星球上
<1-16,Sheldon>with a culture based loosely on earth's athens and sparta?

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,700
<1-16,Sheldon>算了
<1-16,Sheldon>Not important.

31
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,630
<1-16,Sheldon>莱纳德  拉杰和我一起冲出大门逃跑
<1-16,Sheldon>Leonard, raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away.

32
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,860
<1-16,Sheldon>霍华德掩护
<1-16,Sheldon>Howard will cover us.

33
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,460
<1-17,Howard>为什么不是我逃跑你掩护
<1-17,Howard>Why don't I run away and you cover me?

34
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,100
<1-18,Sheldon>因为你用胜利来换取带你母亲看病
<1-18,Sheldon>Because you chose your mother's veins over victory.

35
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,400
<1-18,Sheldon>数到三
<1-18,Sheldon>On three.

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,730
<1-18,Sheldon>一  二  三  闪
<1-18,Sheldon>One, two, three, go!

37
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,530
<1-19,Howard>我必须带她去
<1-19,Howard>I had to take her!

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,800
<1-19,Howard>都快到穿泳衣的天气了
<1-19,Howard>It's almost bathing suit weather!

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,060
<1-19,Howard>我投降  别开枪
<1-19,Howard>I surrender! don't shoot!

40
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,060
<1-20,Leslie>他们从那边走了
<1-20,Leslie>They went that way!

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,230
<1-20,Leslie>霍华德  我是你的队友
<1-20,Leslie>Howard, I'm on your team.

42
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,030
<1-21,Howard>莱斯利  谢天谢地
<1-21,Howard>Oh, leslie, thank god.

43
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,760
<1-22,Leslie>你们小队的其他人呢
<1-22,Leslie>Where's the rest of your squad?

44
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,630
<1-23,Howard>他们把我留下来等死
<1-23,Howard>Ah, they left me here to die.

45
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,160
<1-23,Howard>你的呢
<1-23,Howard>What about yours?

46
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,500
<1-24,Leslie>都死了
<1-24,Leslie>Dead, all of them.

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
<1-25,Howard>真遗憾
<1-25,Howard>Sorry.

48
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,560
<1-25,Howard>没必要
<1-25,Howard>Don't be.

49
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,860
<1-26,Leslie>都是友军误伤
<1-26,Leslie>It was friendly fire.

50
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,760
<1-26,Leslie>他们就是不听话
<1-26,Leslie>They just wouldn't listen.

51
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,930
<1-27,Howard>我们被包围了
<1-27,Howard>Well, we're surrounded,

52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,500
<1-27,Howard>只能等着被俘虏
<1-27,Howard>So I guess there's nothing for us to do

53
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,100
<1-27,Howard>或者被干掉了
<1-27,Howard>but wait to be captured or killed.

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,860
<1-28,Leslie>最难受的是等待
<1-28,Leslie>Hmm, that's the worst part, the waiting.

55
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,450
<1-29,Howard>知道有颗带有你的名字的子弹
<1-29,Howard>All the while knowing that there's a

56
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,600
<1-29,Howard>始终会在那里等着你
<1-29,Howard>Paint pellet out there with your name on it.

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,800
<1-30,Leslie>大大的死亡湿球
<1-30,Leslie>Yeah, the big wet ball of death.

58
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,830
<1-30,Leslie>更能让你感觉自己还活着  对吧
<1-30,Leslie>Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,330
<1-31,Howard>确实
<1-31,Howard>It kind of does.

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,430
<1-32,Leslie>还是别浪费时间吧
<1-32,Leslie>I say we make every moment count.

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,530
<1-33,Howard>可以
<1-33,Howard>I agree.

62
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,660
<1-33,Howard>有什么可做的呢
<1-33,Howard>How exactly do we do that?

63
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,300
<1-34,Leonard (voice)>霍华德  你怎么不掩护我们
<1-34,Leonard (voice)>Howard, why aren't you covering us?!

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,300
<1-34,Leonard (voice)>我们快被杀光了
<1-34,Leonard (voice)>We're getting slaughtered out here!

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,630
<1-35,Howard>战场就是地狱
<1-35,Howard>War is hell.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,670
<2-1,Raj>你们早上看了新的预算备忘了吗
<2-1,Raj>Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?

67
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,640
<2-2,Leonard>又减少了
<2-2,Leonard>Yeah, more cutbacks.

68
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,250
<2-3,Sheldon>太无法接受了
<2-3,Sheldon>Unacceptable.

69
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,990
<2-3,Sheldon>我就想不明白  他们干嘛不直接放弃你们
<2-3,Sheldon>It baffles me why they don't simply let some of

70
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,170
<2-3,Sheldon>就有更多钱给我做试验了
<2-3,Sheldon>You go so that there's money available for my research.

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,840
<2-4,Leonard>你知道我烦恼什么吗  谢尔顿
<2-4,Leonard>You know what baffles me, sheldon?

72
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,640
<2-5,Sheldon>就你的成绩来看  我看是任何事
<2-5,Sheldon>Based on your academic record, any number of things, I imagine.

73
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,240
<2-6,Leslie>-伙计们  -莱斯利
<2-6,Leslie>Hey, guys. hey, leslie. hey.

74
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,740
<2-9,Leslie>霍华德  我帮你拿到高速原型机的批准了
<2-9,Leslie>Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.

75
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,910
<2-10,Howard>太好了  莱斯利  谢谢
<2-10,Howard>That's great, leslie. thanks.

76
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,040
<2-11,Leslie>互帮互助而已啦
<2-11,Leslie>You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,210
<2-12,Raj>那是什么意思
<2-12,Raj>What was all that about?

78
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,310
<2-13,Howard>没什么
<2-13,Howard>Oh, uh, no big deal.

79
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,240
<2-13,Howard>他们让莱斯利管一些自由经费
<2-13,Howard>They gave leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.

80
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,310
<2-14,Leonard>那挠背和"喵"又是怎么回事
<2-14,Leonard>Yeah, okay, but what's with the back- scratching and the meow!

81
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,380
<2-15,Sheldon>我觉得挠背的隐喻
<2-15,Sheldon>I believe the back-scratching metaphor

82
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,140
<2-15,Sheldon>通常指投桃报李的情况
<2-15,Sheldon>Generally describes a quid pro quo situation where

83
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,480
<2-15,Sheldon>一方提供物品或服务给另一方
<2-15,Sheldon>One party provides goods or services to the

84
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,140
<2-15,Sheldon>报答一种类似之举
<2-15,Sheldon>Second party in compensation for a similar action.

85
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,240
<2-16,Leonard>谢谢
<2-16,Leonard>Thank you.

86
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,240
<2-17,Sheldon>至于"喵"  我感觉听起来像非洲的麝猫
<2-17,Sheldon>The meow, that sounded to me like an african civet cat.

87
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,670
<2-18,Leonard>说完了吗
<2-18,Leonard>Are you done?

88
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,870
<2-18,Leonard>没有
<2-18,Leonard>No.

89
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,110
<2-19,Sheldon>尽管名字里有猫  但其实麝猫不是真的猫
<2-19,Sheldon>Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat.

90
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,040
<2-18,Leonard>说完了
<2-18,Leonard>Now I'm done.

91
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,570
<2-19,Sheldon>知道我怎么想吗
<2-19,Sheldon>You know what I'm thinking?

92
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,270
<2-20,Raj>我觉得霍华德并不是用挠背做隐喻
<2-20,Raj>I'm thinking howard wasn't making a back-scratching metaphor.

93
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,740
<2-20,Raj>我觉得确有挠背一说呢
<2-20,Raj>I'm thinking there was some actual scratching involved.

94
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,710
<2-21,Leonard>是吗  霍华德
<2-21,Leonard>What about it, howard?

95
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,200
<2-22,Howard>我不想说是因为
<2-22,Howard>I didn't want to say anything 'cause I

96
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,710
<2-22,Howard>我知道你和莱斯利以前好过
<2-22,Howard>Know you and leslie have a little history.

97
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,020
<2-23,Leonard>我不在乎
<2-23,Leonard>I don't care about that.

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,220
<2-24,Howard>太好了  我其实早就想说了
<2-24,Howard>Great, 'cause I've been dying to say something?

99
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,350
<2-26,Howard>在彩弹小屋里!  两次!
<2-26,Howard>In the paintball shed! twice!

100
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,200
<2-27,Sheldon>这就是为什么你没有掩护我们撤退
<2-27,Sheldon>Is that why you didn't cover our Escape

101
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,720
<2-27,Sheldon>还让我们像牲口般被屠宰?
<2-27,Sheldon>and let us get cut down like animals?

102
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,350
<2-28,Howard>对此我非常抱歉
<2-28,Howard>Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

103
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,760
<2-29,Sheldon>阵前脱逃
<2-29,Sheldon>Dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is

104
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,980
<2-29,Sheldon>是要被送交军事法庭的
<2-29,Sheldon>a court-martial offense.

105
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,100
<2-30,Howard>管他什么军事法庭[德语]
<2-30,Howard>Court-martial, schmort-martial,

106
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,020
<2-30,Howard>莱斯利·温克尔是第五个和我做过爱的女生
<2-30,Howard>Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with.

107
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,720
<2-30,Howard>我是说  不包括付费的
<2-30,Howard>I mean, for free.

108
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,080
<2-31,Raj>而且你还拿到了高速原型机
<2-31,Raj>And plus, you got a rapid prototyper.

109
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,850
<2-31,Raj>老兄 那玩意可不便宜
<2-31,Raj>That's an expensive piece of equipment, dude.

110
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,550
<2-31,Raj>我们剩下的人的预算就被啃到见骨了
<2-31,Raj>And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.

111
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,600
<3-1,Howard>你可以这样看这个问题
<3-1,Howard>Okay, one way to look at this is that I'm getting new equipment,

112
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,880
<3-1,Howard>我有了新设备  你们没有  这不公平
<3-1,Howard>And you're not, and that's unfair.

113
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,130
<3-1,Howard>更好的角度是 我有女人而你们没有
<3-1,Howard>But a better way to look at this is that I'm getting sex and you're not,

114
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,550
<3-1,Howard>还有什么比这更好
<3-1,Howard>And that's delightful.

115
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,520
<3-1,Howard>所有东西都不响应了
<3-1,Howard>The whole thing froze.

116
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,680
<4-1,Penny>不知道怎么回事
<4-1,Penny>I don't know what happened.

117
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,020
<4-2,Leonard>冷静点  能解决的
<4-2,Leonard>Calm down. we'll figure it out.

118
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,350
<4-3,Penny>我怎么能冷静得了?
<4-3,Penny>How can I calm down?

119
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,950
<4-3,Penny>我的整个购物车都要被清空了

<4-12,Sheldon>In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency.

<4-12,Sheldon>on a four-dimensional cartesian Coordinate system,

133
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,310
<4-12,Sheldon>这个座位从我坐上那一刻开始 就成为了 (0,0,0,0)
<4-12,Sheldon>That spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.

134
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,210
<4-13,Penny>你说啥?
<4-13,Penny>What?

<4-17,Penny>我爱他 不过他也太极品怪胎了
<4-17,Penny>Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.

140
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,510
<4-18,Leonard>好了  电脑修好了
<4-18,Leonard>Okay, that should do it.

141

<4-19,Penny>太感谢了  真是我的恩人
<4-19,Penny>Oh, thank you. you are a lifesaver.

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,450
<4-20,Leonard>你订了可真不少
<4-20,Leonard>That's a lot of shoes you ordered.

143
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,180
<4-21,Penny>可悲的是其实这些对我来说真的不算多了
<4-21,Penny>Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it's really not.

144
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,450
<4-21,Penny>这就是你们的彩弹枪?

148
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,780
<4-23,Penny>要么是让他们别妨碍我和男友办事
<4-23,Penny>or make them leave our boyfriends alone.

<5-1,Leslie>孩子  你心跳在狂飙 我果然魅力无边啊

<5-2,Howard>一半是你的原因   一半是我先天就心律紊乱
<5-2,Howard>Well, it's partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

151
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,450

<5-5,Leslie>你满足了我
<5-5,Leslie>Satisfactory?

154
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,980
<5-6,Howard>这不是我原本打算的措辞  不过当然
<5-6,Howard>That wasn't quite the word I was looking for, but sure,

155
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,080
<5-6,Howard>我知道我合格了
<5-6,Howard>I'll do this pass-fail.

<5-9,Leslie>Isn't it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?

160
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,480
<5-10,Howard>一般人理解不了
<5-10,Howard>You know, most people don't get that.

<7-10,Sheldon>你声称说一周就好
<7-10,Sheldon>You claimed it's going to be a week,

249
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,810

<8-18,Howard>用研究旅行和新设备来控制我

<9-24,Leonard>Yeah, well, before they went out of business,

356
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,770
<9-24,Leonard>我买了四千个他们的盒子
<9-24,Leonard>I bought 4,000 containers.

357
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,730
<9-24,Leonard>然后藏在我车子后面
<9-24,Leonard>I keep them in the trunk of my car.

358
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,970
<9-25,Sheldon>但是
<9-25,Sheldon>But...

359
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,830
<9-25,Sheldon>天哪  一切都不同了
<9-25,Sheldon>Oh, this changes everything.

360
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,700
<9-26,Leonard>我觉得这样他就不会去想坐垫
<9-26,Leonard>I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.

361
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,370
<9-27,Sheldon>什么是真实  什么是虚假
<9-27,Sheldon>What's real? what isn't?

362
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,700
<9-27,Sheldon>我怎么才能知道
<9-27,Sheldon>How can I know?

363
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,970
<9-28,Penny>你编故事的是不
<9-28,Penny>You did make that up, right?

364
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,930
<9-29,Leonard>我倒希望是编的
<9-29,Leonard>Oh, god, I wish I had.

365
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,630
<9-30,Sheldon>莱纳德?
<9-30,Sheldon>Leonard?

366
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,530
<9-31,Leonard>怎么老兄
<9-31,Leonard>Yeah, buddy?

367
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,430
<9-32,Sheldon>我还是不喜欢这个垫子
<9-32,Sheldon>I still don't like this cushion.

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,370
<10-1,Leonard>首先  佩妮感谢你能加入我们
<10-1,Leonard>Ok first of all, penny, thank you for coming.

369
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,830
<10-2,Penny>谢谢你买的鞋子
<10-2,Penny>Thanks for the shoes.

370
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,200
<10-3,Leonard>佩妮射击很牛叉
<10-3,Leonard>Penny is an amazing shot.

371
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,030
<10-3,Leonard>我想我们这次很可能会赢
<10-3,Leonard>I think we have a real chance to win this week.

372
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,030
<10-4,Howard>什么策略
<10-4,Howard>What's the plan?

373
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,770
<10-4,Howard>好  我们先跑出去
<10-4,Howard>Okay. now, we all run out.

374
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,200
<10-4,Howard>谢尔顿和我在树那边切断他们的左路
<10-4,Howard>Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees.

375
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,920
<10-3,Leonard>拉杰 和霍华德 还有莱斯利
<10-3,Leonard>Raj, howard and leslie

376
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,570
<10-3,Leonard>你们从石头后面包抄
<10-3,Leonard>flank to the right behind the rocks.

377
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,380
<10-3,Leonard>这样佩妮的视野就开阔了
<10-3,Leonard>Then we'll all have a great view as penny

378
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,230
<10-3,Leonard>然后她把视野内所有敌人消灭
<10-3,Leonard>Runs out and kills everyone else in sight.

379
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,200
<11-1,Sheldon>我们开始前还有一件事
<11-1,Sheldon>Just one thing before we start.

380
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,100
<11-2,Leonard>什么  谢尔顿
<11-2,Leonard>What is it, sheldon?

381
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,130
<11-3,Penny>搞什么
<11-3,Penny>What the hell?!

382
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,300
<11-4,Sheldon>这是为我的坐垫
<11-4,Sheldon>That was for my cushion.

383
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,870
<11-5,Leonard>谢尔顿  佩妮是我们唯一的希望
<11-5,Leonard>Sheldon, penny was our only hope.

00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,930
<11-6,Sheldon>对不起莱纳德
<11-6,Sheldon>I'm sorry, leonard.

385
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
<11-6,Sheldon>君子报仇十年不晚
<11-6,Sheldon>But revenge is a dish best served cold.

386
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,130
<11-7,Penny>去你的
<11-7,Penny>Screw that.

387
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,790
<11-8,Sheldon>她不能射我  她已经死了
<11-8,Sheldon>She can't shoot me. she's dead.

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,790
<11-9,Leonard>是的  你不能
<11-9,Leonard>He's right. you can't.

389
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,730
<11-10,Sheldon>好  如果我们要堕入无政府主义混乱的话...
<11-10,Sheldon>Well, if we're going to descend into anarchy...

390
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,700
<11-11,Howard>你们慢慢打  我们先走了
<11-11,Howard>Okay, see you.

391
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,530
<11-12,Leonard>等等你们去哪儿
<11-12,Leonard>Where are you going?

392
