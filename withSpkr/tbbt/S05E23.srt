1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,830
<1-1,Howard>霍华德·沃罗威茨
<1-1,Howard>Howard Wolowitz.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,890
<1-2,Voice>霍华德  我是太空总署的戴夫·罗杰
<1-2,Voice>Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,970
<1-2,Voice>我们需要谈谈你接下来的任务
<1-2,Voice>We need to talk about your upcoming mission.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,400
<1-3,Howard>没问题  我每天都还有在做俯卧撑呢
<1-3,Howard>Yes, yes, I've been doing my push-ups.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,170
<1-3,Howard>虽然我目前只能做九个  但...
<1-3,Howard>I'm still stuck at nine, but...

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,490
<1-3,Howard>这都是没人托着我的情况下顺利完成的
<1-3,Howard>...that's going all the way down with no one holding me.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,010
<1-4,Roeger>那很好  但这不是我找你的原因
<1-4,Roeger>That's great, uh, but that's not why I called.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,900
<1-4,Roeger>我们遇到点大麻烦
<1-4,Roeger>We've run into a bit of a snafu.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,380
<1-4,Roeger>你的联盟号太空舱没通过增压测试
<1-4,Roeger>Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test,

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,800
<1-4,Roeger>总而言之  你的任务被废止了
<1-4,Roeger>so bottom line, mission's been scrubbed.

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,240
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>不是吧  那"废止"的意思是...
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>You're kidding. So what does that mean?

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,540
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>我不得不说
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>Boy, I got to tell you,

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,990
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>我真的很失望
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>I'm really disappointed.

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,000
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>这是我儿时以来的梦想
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>This was my dream ever since I was a little kid.

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,910
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>无论如何  还是要感谢您的来电
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>Okay, well, uh,  thanks for the call.

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,310
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>好的  您也保重
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>Yep, you, too.

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,100
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>太棒了  谢天谢地啊
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>Yes! Thank you!

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,040
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>老子不用死在太空里了
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>I'm not gonna die in space!

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,130
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>我可以按照上帝的旨意
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>I'm gonna die the way God intended,

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,500
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>五六十岁时  死于吃太多熏肉引发的心脏病了
<1-5,Howard (Picks up receiver)>in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,190
<2-1,Sheldon (off)>我需要一件更大的衬衫
<2-1,Sheldon (off)>I'm going to need a larger shirt.

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,330
<2-1,Sheldon (off)>这件腋下部位有点紧
<2-1,Sheldon (off)>This one's a little tight under the arms.

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,420
<2-2,Assistant>好吧
<2-2,Assistant>Okay.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,010
<2-3,Leonard>你不觉得之所以会紧
<2-3,Leonard>Do you think maybe it's tight

34
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,830
<2-3,Leonard>是因为你里面穿了套长的内衣裤吗
<2-3,Leonard>because you're wearing long underwear?

35
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,970
<2-4,Sheldon>废话  当然是因为这个
<2-4,Sheldon>Yes, of course that's why it's tight.

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,880
<2-5,Leonard>好吧  让我重新表述下问题
<2-5,Leonard>All right, let me rephrase the question.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,480
<2-5,Leonard>你干嘛要穿长的内衣裤啊
<2-5,Leonard>Why are you wearing long underwear?

38
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,920
<2-5,Leonard>你不是吧
<2-5,Leonard>You're kidding.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,370
<2-6,Sheldon>重点应该是  "为何你不穿长内衣裤"
<2-6,Sheldon>Shouldn't the question be: why aren't you?

40
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,160
<2-7,Leonard>不  应该是"为何你穿啊"
<2-7,Leonard>No, it should be: why are you?

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,900
<2-8,Sheldon>莱纳德  这些租赁的礼服早已被
<2-8,Sheldon>Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,710
<2-8,Sheldon>上百个满身臭汗的陌生人穿过
<2-8,Sheldon>worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers.

43
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,930
<2-8,Sheldon>我连沾到自己的汗都讨厌
<2-8,Sheldon>I don't like my own sweat touching my skin,

44
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,480
<2-8,Sheldon>陌生人的汗不是更要命吗
<2-8,Sheldon>how do you think I feel about theirs?

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,930
<2-9,Assistant>试试这件吧
<2-9,Assistant>Why don't you slip this on?

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,050
<2-10,Sheldon>就跟绞刑吏来送绞索一样
<2-10,Sheldon>Said the hangman offering a noose.

47
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,830
<2-11,Raj>虽然不如他租保龄球鞋时搞笑
<2-11,Raj>Well, that wasn't as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes,

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,620
<2-11,Raj>不过也相差无几了
<2-11,Raj>but it was right up there.

49
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,940
<2-12,Howard>好吧  木已成舟
<2-12,Howard>Well, that's it.

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,780
<2-12,Howard>我的任命被撤销了
<2-12,Howard>My orders have been rescinded.

51
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,260
<2-12,Howard>我正式"去不成"太空了
<2-12,Howard>I am officially "no go" to space.

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,420
<2-13,Leonard>我很遗憾  霍华德  不过老实说
<2-13,Leonard>I'm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you,

53
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,310
<2-13,Leonard>你去不成  我反倒松了一口气
<2-13,Leonard>I'm a little relieved you're not going.

54
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,450
<2-14,Howard>为什么
<2-14,Howard>Why?

55
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,010
<2-15,Leonard>拜托  送你上太空的火箭
<2-15,Leonard>Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket

56
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,400
<2-15,Leonard>可是俄国人在上世纪六十年代设计的
<2-15,Leonard>designed in the 1960s by the Russians.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,770
<2-16,Howard>是啊  那又如何
<2-16,Howard>Yeah, so?

58
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,520
<2-17,Leonard>你可有过去百思买购物时
<2-17,Leonard>When was the last time you were at Best Buy

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,780
<2-17,Leonard>听别人说  "快看这个蓝光播放器
<2-17,Leonard>and you heard someone say, "ooh, check out this Blu-ray player,

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,920
<2-17,Leonard>是俄国制造的呢  肯定不错"的经验吗
<2-17,Leonard>it must be good, it was built in Russia"?

61
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,670
<2-18,Howard>他们的技术也没那么糟啦
<2-18,Howard>Well, their technology isn't that bad.

62
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,250
<2-19,Raj>当你坐着联盟号太空舱返回地球时
<2-19,Raj>When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule,

63
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,730
<2-19,Raj>你会以每小时500英里的速度自由落体
<2-19,Raj>you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour,

64
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,360
<2-19,Raj>唯一帮你减速的东西
<2-19,Raj>and the only thing that slows you down

65
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,980
<2-19,Raj>是你撞向地面的前一刻
<2-19,Raj>is a little parachute that pops out

66
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,620
<2-19,Raj>弹出的小小降落伞
<2-19,Raj>right before you crash into the ground.

67
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,090
<2-19,Raj>而设计这火箭的人  可是连飞鼠洛奇和
<2-19,Raj>And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds

68
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,330
<2-19,Raj>驯鹿布尔温克都抓不到的"聪明"俄国人呢
<2-19,Raj>who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.

69
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,330
<2-19,Raj>飞鼠洛奇和驯鹿布尔温克
<2-19,Raj>美国六十年代经典卡通片《飞鼠洛基冒险记》的主角

70
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,750
<2-20,Howard>好吧  不管怎么说
<2-20,Howard>All right, well, whatever.

71
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,060
<2-20,Howard>我一点也不担心
<2-20,Howard>I wasn't worried.

72
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,150
<2-21,Raj>是吗
<2-21,Raj>You weren't?

73
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,070
<2-22,Howard>让我解释一下你和我的区别
<2-22,Howard>Let me explain the difference between you and me.

74
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,120
<2-22,Howard>你是《星际迷航》的看客
<2-22,Howard>You watch Star Trek

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,420
<2-22,Howard>而我是住客
<2-22,Howard>I live it.

76
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,770
<2-23,Raj>拜托  《星际迷航》可有过任何一集
<2-23,Raj>Oh, please. I don't remember the episode of Star Trek

77
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,310
<2-23,Raj>是讲一个没去成太空的家伙
<2-23,Raj>where the guy never goes to space

78
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,720
<2-23,Raj>在礼服店自吹自擂的故事啊
<2-23,Raj>and brags about it in a tuxedo store.

79
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,350
<2-24,Howard>随你怎么嘲笑我
<2-24,Howard>Make all the jokes you want,

80
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,520
<2-24,Howard>但我们之中  也就只有一个人足够勇敢
<2-24,Howard>but there's only one of us here brave enough

81
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,060
<2-24,Howard>差点真做了上太空的大业
<2-24,Howard>to almost do what I almost did.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,210
<2-25,Sheldon>这回好多了
<2-25,Sheldon>Ah, much better.

83
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,390
<2-26,Leonard>你现在肯定热得要死吧
<2-26,Leonard>You must be burning up.

84
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,340
<2-27,Sheldon>是有点  不过也比你们从那些裤子染上点
<2-27,Sheldon>A little. But not more than your urethras will be

85
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,750
<2-27,Sheldon>不知名的病菌  然后尿道灼热瘙痒来得强
<2-27,Sheldon>after whatever's in those pants swims up them.

86
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,210
<2-27,Sheldon>我将潇洒与卫生完美的结合起来了  不是吗
<2-27,Sheldon>I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I?

87
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,200
<2-27,Sheldon>我看上去就像是闪电侠要结婚了
<2-27,Sheldon>I look like the Flash about to get married.

88
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,280
<2-27,Sheldon>天啊  废纸巾  废纸巾
<2-27,Sheldon>Oh! A tissue! A tissue!

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,650
<2-27,Sheldon>上帝啊
<2-27,Sheldon>Oh, good Lord!

90
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,040
<2-28,Assistant>他要上哪去
<2-28,Assistant>Uh, where's he going?

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,400
<2-29,Leonard>他在车里准备了紧急消毒液
<2-29,Leonard>He keeps emergency Purell in the car.

92
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,940
<2-30,Sheldon>钥匙给我 给我  给我
<2-30,Sheldon>Keys! Keys! Keys!

93
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,890
<3-2,Leonard>-是你啊  -我进来之前
<3-2,Leonard>- Hey, you. - Before I come in,

94
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,260
<3-2,Leonard>得先告诉你  我可是有"气"而来哟
<3-2,Leonard>you should know, I have gas.

95
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,230
<3-3,Penny>说起来  你还说过更烂的开场白呢
<3-3,Penny>For the record, not your worst opening line.

96
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,130
<3-4,Leonard>来看吧  这瓶气是我用来让
<3-4,Leonard>Check it out. It's the gas I use

97
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,470
<3-4,Leonard>自由电子激光支持高电压的
<3-4,Leonard>in my free-electron laser to support high voltages.

98
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,980
<3-4,Leonard>但它还有个有趣的第二用途
<3-4,Leonard>But it also has an interesting secondary use.

99
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,120
<3-4,Leonard>给你  吸一口
<3-4,Leonard>Here. Breathe this in.

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,150
<3-5,Penny>在我吸之前
<3-5,Penny>B-Before I do it,

101
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,000
<3-5,Penny>如果你是条子  你会告诉我的吧
<3-5,Penny>if you're a cop you have to tell me, right?

102
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,130
<3-6,Leonard>-吸就好啦  -好吧
<3-6,Leonard>- Just try it. - Okay.

103
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,710
<3-7,Penny>吸完后会...
<3-7,Penny>What's it supposed to...

104
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,590
<3-7,Penny>天啊  这太诡异了
<3-7,Penny>Oh, my God, that's so freaky!

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,780
<3-8,Leonard (in low voice)>"你这个小气鬼"
<3-8,Leonard (in low voice)>You're a mean one

107
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,100
<3-8,Leonard (in low voice)>"圣诞怪杰先生"
<3-8,Leonard (in low voice)>Mr. Grinch.

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
<3-9,Penny>好了好了  到我了  准备好没
<3-9,Penny>Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?

109
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,800
<3-9,Penny>莱纳德  我是你爹
<3-9,Penny>Leonard, I am your father.

110
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,290
<3-10,Leonard>我这辈子从没这么被一个
<3-10,Leonard>I have never been more attracted to a woman

111
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,090
<3-10,Leonard>声音像男人的女人吸引过
<3-10,Leonard>who sounds like a man in my life.

112
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,320
<3-11,Penny>你知道我们一直...
<3-11,Penny>Hey... you know how we've been...

113
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,190
<3-11,Penny>进展得比较慢吧
<3-11,Penny>taking things slow?

114
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,680
<3-12,Leonard>我最近一直在想...
<3-12,Leonard>Well, I've been thinking, and...

115
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,670
<3-13,Penny>或许我准备好...
<3-13,Penny>maybe I'm ready to...

116
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,400
<3-13,Penny>让进展加快...一点点啦
<3-13,Penny>take things a little... faster.

117
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,380
<3-14,Leonard>太好了
<3-14,Leonard>Oh, great.

118
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,670
<3-16,Leonard>我向你保证  憋了四个月之后
<3-16,Leonard>And I promise, after waiting four months,

119
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,420
<3-16,Leonard>也就只能当"快枪手"了
<3-16,Leonard>fast is what you're gonna get.

120
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,070
<3-17,Penny>不过有个问题
<3-17,Penny>You know, just-just one thing.

121
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,470
<3-17,Penny>我们现在关系那么融洽
<3-17,Penny>Look, we're in a really great place right now,

122
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,700
<3-17,Penny>我不想做出任何
<3-17,Penny>and I don't want to do anything

123
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,470
<3-17,Penny>把关系弄尴尬的事情
<3-17,Penny>that will make stuff all weird again.

124
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,280
<3-18,Leonard>那我们就别让它变尴尬不得了
<3-18,Leonard>So we won't let it get weird.

125
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,000
<3-19,Penny>行  我还得提个醒
<3-19,Penny>Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up...

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,910
<3-19,Penny>从我们上次"亲密"到现在这之间
<3-19,Penny>mm, since the last time you saw me naked,

128
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,700
<3-19,Penny>我纹了个甜怪饼纹身
<3-19,Penny>I got a Cookie Monster tattoo.

129
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,570
<3-19,Penny>你看到的时候  除了称赞"好炫"
<3-19,Penny>The acceptable response"s when you see it

130
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,170
<3-19,Penny>我不想听到其他废话
<3-19,Penny>are "awesome" or nothing.

131
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,330
<3-20,Leonard>那我就说
<3-20,Leonard>What about...

132
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,890
<3-20,Leonard>我要甜饼
<3-20,Leonard>Cookies!

133
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,340
<4-1,Sheldon>艾米
<4-1,Sheldon>Amy?

134
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,590
<4-1,Sheldon>艾米
<4-1,Sheldon>Amy?

135
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,840
<4-1,Sheldon>艾米
<4-1,Sheldon>Amy?

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,970
<4-2,Amy>七点  刚好准时
<4-2,Amy>7:00, right on time.

137
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,670
<4-3,Sheldon>这可不是什么"刚好"
<4-3,Sheldon>It's not an accident.

138
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,930
<4-3,Sheldon>人家在足足在门外等了二十分钟呢
<4-3,Sheldon>I waited outside your door for 20 minutes.

139
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,380
<4-4,Amy>晚餐马上就好
<4-4,Amy>Well, dinner's almost ready.

140
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,630
<4-5,Sheldon>我不得不说
<4-5,Sheldon>I must say,

141
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,940
<4-5,Sheldon>我真没想到你会选择在家里
<4-5,Sheldon>I was surprised you chose to spend

142
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,700
<4-5,Sheldon>度过我们的约会之夜
<4-5,Sheldon>our date night in your apartment.

143
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,880
<4-5,Sheldon>正如我提到的
<4-5,Sheldon>As I mentioned,

144
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,890
<4-5,Sheldon>帕萨迪纳市议会正在辩论加长行人过马路的时间
<4-5,Sheldon>the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times,

145
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,670
<4-5,Sheldon>而且  乐高专卖店午夜还会举行疯狂大甩卖
<4-5,Sheldon>and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale.

146
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,230
<4-5,Sheldon>任谁都觉得那样的约会更血脉喷张
<4-5,Sheldon>You ask anyone, that's a hot date.

147
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,450
<4-6,Amy>是挺诱人  不过今晚我准备了
<4-6,Amy>Tempting choices, but I have something special

148
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,670
<4-6,Amy>一些特别的东西
<4-6,Amy>planned for tonight.

149
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,010
<4-7,Sheldon>有什么能比
<4-7,Sheldon>What can be more special than

150
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,670
<4-7,Sheldon>在去买乐高夺宝奇兵模型的路上
<4-7,Sheldon>having an adequate amount of time to cross the street

151
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,910
<4-7,Sheldon>能有充足时间过马路更特别啊
<4-7,Sheldon>on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?

152
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,040
<4-8,Amy>鉴于我们的朋友  关系都正在向前发展
<4-8,Amy>With our friends moving forward in their relationships,

153
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,790
<4-8,Amy>我决定我们的关系也该更进一步了
<4-8,Amy>I've decided that we should make progress in ours as well.

154
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,610
<4-9,Sheldon>老天哪
<4-9,Sheldon>Oh, dear Lord.

155
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,760
<4-9,Sheldon>两年前我们还不认识对方呢
<4-9,Sheldon>Two years ago, we didn't even know each other,

156
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,890
<4-9,Sheldon>现在我们就"夜晚时分你家见"了
<4-9,Sheldon>and now I'm in your apartment after dark.

157
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,330
<4-9,Sheldon>这关系进展得还不够快吗
<4-9,Sheldon>How much faster can this thing go?

158
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,000
<4-10,Amy>我早有预感你会不同意
<4-10,Amy>I had a feeling you'd be reluctant,

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,220
<4-10,Amy>所以我准备要使出我
<4-10,Amy>which is why I'm going to dip

160
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,270
<4-10,Amy>神经生物学版的锦囊妙计了
<4-10,Amy>into my neurobiological bag of tricks.

161
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,680
<4-11,Sheldon>你那些猴子主意最好玩了  挖吧
<4-11,Sheldon>Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.

162
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,530
<4-12,Amy>我设计了一个实验
<4-12,Amy>I have devised an experiment

163
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,860
<4-12,Amy>我相信这能让你
<4-12,Amy>that I believe will increase your feelings for me

164
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,410
<4-12,Amy>加快对我产生感情
<4-12,Amy>in an accelerated time frame.

165
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,800
<4-13,Sheldon>你准备怎么做呢
<4-13,Sheldon>And how do you propose to do that?

166
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
<4-13,Sheldon>希望你不是想着
<4-13,Sheldon>Uh, hope you're not thinking

167
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,140
<4-13,Sheldon>用迷幻药来对我进行思想控制
<4-13,Sheldon>about some sort of LSD thought control.

168
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,800
<4-13,Sheldon>因为我只喜欢一种迷药  此药名"知识"
<4-13,Sheldon>Because there's only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys,

169
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,380
<4-13,Sheldon>"唯知识能令我着迷"
<4-13,Sheldon>and that's called school.

170
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,590
<4-14,Amy>情感的依赖是随着人类生长而诞生的
<4-14,Amy>Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up.

171
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,640
<4-14,Amy>以你来说  你依恋母亲  超能英雄等等
<4-14,Amy>In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera.

172
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,040
<4-14,Amy>我准备尝试一个实验
<4-14,Amy>I'm going to attempt an experiment that

173
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,610
<4-14,Amy>让你将这些情感转移到我身上
<4-14,Amy>will get you to transfer those feelings to me.

174
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,390
<4-15,Sheldon>看来今晚的菜
<4-15,Sheldon>Well, seems what's on the menu tonight

175
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,140
<4-15,Sheldon>只有"胡言乱语"和"胡说八道"呢
<4-15,Sheldon>is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.

176
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,050
<4-16,Amy>试了才知道
<4-16,Amy>We'll see.

177
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,780
<4-16,Amy>我们先听一首浪漫的晚餐音乐  好吗
<4-16,Amy>Let's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?

178
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,240
<4-17,Sheldon>超级玛丽的主题曲
<4-17,Sheldon>Super Mario Bros.theme?

179
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,260
<4-18,Amy>没错
<4-18,Amy>Yes.

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,150
<4-19,Sheldon>我明白你在干什么了
<4-19,Sheldon>I see what you're doing.

181
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:16,700
<4-19,Sheldon>德国心理学家  首先设计了测量机械学习和记忆的实验方法
<4-19,Sheldon>证实了记忆是基于联想

182
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,360
<4-19,Sheldon>你想如法炮制艾宾豪斯的方法
<4-19,Sheldon>You're attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus

183
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,700
<4-19,Sheldon>从潜意识勾起我玩这个游戏时的记忆
<4-19,Sheldon>by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game--

184
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,850
<4-19,Sheldon>也就是我儿时那最快乐的六百个小时
<4-19,Sheldon>admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood...

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,520
<4-19,Sheldon>不过这是没用的
<4-19,Sheldon>...but it won't work.

186
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,290
<4-20,Amy>好吧  但也不影响我们享用晚餐
<4-20,Amy>Fine. There's no reason we still can't have a lovely dinner.

187
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,660
<4-20,Amy>你先就坐吧
<4-20,Amy>Why don't you have a seat.

188
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,710
<4-22,Amy>我给你倒点饮料喝吧
<4-22,Amy>May I offer you something to drink?

189
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,280
<4-23,Sheldon>你知道我不喝饮料
<4-23,Sheldon>You know I don't drink.

190
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,630
<4-24,Amy>这个也不喝吗
<4-24,Amy>Not even...

191
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,010
<4-24,Amy>草莓速溶奶
<4-24,Amy>strawberry Quik?

192
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,750
<4-25,Sheldon>我超爱草莓速溶奶
<4-25,Sheldon>I love strawberry Quik.

193
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,950
<4-25,Sheldon>我最喜欢的粉色液体
<4-25,Sheldon>It's my favorite pink fluid,

194
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,810
<4-25,Sheldon>比佩托比斯摩[粉色液体胃药]略胜一筹
<4-25,Sheldon>narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.

195
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,420
<4-26,Amy>我知道
<4-26,Amy>Oh, I know.

196
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,110
<4-26,Amy>我觉得这个正好搭配
<4-26,Amy>I think it will go nicely

197
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,790
<4-26,Amy>我特意准备的
<4-26,Amy>with what I have prepared...

198
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,100
<4-26,Amy>晚餐
<4-26,Amy>for dinner.

199
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,060
<4-27,Sheldon>意粉  里面还加了热狗切片
<4-27,Sheldon>Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!

200
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,350
<4-28,Amy>跟以前你妈妈做的一样
<4-28,Amy>Just like your mommy used to make.

201
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,210
<4-29,Sheldon>大餐啊大餐
<4-29,Sheldon>Oh... yummy, yummy!

202
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,720
<4-29,Sheldon>我们以后要经常这样约会
<4-29,Sheldon>We should do this more often.

203
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,840
<4-29,Sheldon>糟糕
<4-29,Sheldon>Uh-oh.

204
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,400
<5-1,Leonard>对不起  我错了
<5-1,Leonard>I'm sorry. I did,

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,310
<5-1,Leonard>我太过分了  我不是故意的
<5-1,Leonard>I crossed a line. I didn't mean to!

206
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,810
<5-2,Penny>有谁会在做爱的时候说这样的话啊
<5-2,Penny>Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?!

207
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,120
<5-3,Leonard>我不知道  不自觉就说出口了
<5-3,Leonard>I don't know, it just came out.

208
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,550
<5-3,Leonard>很多人在做爱期间都会说奇怪的话嘛
<5-3,Leonard>People say weird things during sex all the time.

209
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,880
<5-4,Penny>可没人会说这个啊
<5-4,Penny>Okay, well, they sure as hell don't say that.

210
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,190
<5-5,Leonard>-高潮时刻  情不自禁嘛  -放屁
<5-5,Leonard>- It was the heat of the moment. - No,

211
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,120
<5-6,Penny>高潮时刻应该是说"对  太爽了"
<5-6,Penny>the heat of the moment is, "Ooh, yeah, just like that,"

212
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,070
<5-6,Penny>而不是说"你愿意嫁给我吗"
<5-6,Penny>not "will you marry me?"

213
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,400
<5-6,Penny>对不起
<5-6,Penny>I'm sorry.

214
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,970
<5-7,Leonard>再给我一次机会吧
<5-7,Leonard>Just-just give me another chance.

215
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,540
<5-8,Penny>好让你下次能有机会在滚床单时说
<5-8,Penny>Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go,

216
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,930
<5-8,Penny>"宝贝  想去看看
<5-8,Penny>"Hey, baby, want to go look for houses

217
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,960
<5-8,Penny>在好学校学区里的房子吗"
<5-8,Penny>in neighborhoods with good schools?"

218
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,670
<5-9,Leonard>我还是那句话  对不起
<5-9,Leonard>Again, I'm sorry.

219
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,050
<5-9,Leonard>你也知道  霍华德和伯纳黛特要结婚了
<5-9,Leonard>You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married,

220
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,980
<5-9,Leonard>我被这股结婚热感染了
<5-9,Leonard>I got caught up in a little wedding fever.

221
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,060
<5-9,Leonard>我收回那句话
<5-9,Leonard>I take it back.

222
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,380
<5-10,Penny>这种话覆水难收啊
<5-10,Penny>You can't take something like that back.

223
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,160
<5-10,Penny>我们现在该如何是好
<5-10,Penny>I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?

224
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,960
<5-11,Leonard>说不定将来  某天回想起
<5-11,Leonard>Okay, at some point, we'll look back

225
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,890
<5-11,Leonard>会觉得这其实挺搞笑的啊
<5-11,Leonard>and this is going to be a funny story.

226
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,240
<5-11,Leonard>我们现在就可以当笑话看嘛
<5-11,Leonard>Why don't we just start doing that now?

227
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,300
<5-12,Penny>-你不是吧  -我是说真的
<5-12,Penny>- You're kidding. - No.

228
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,510
<5-13,Leonard>你还记不记得
<5-13,Leonard>Hey, do you remember...

229
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,070
<5-13,Leonard>我在床上向你求婚的那件事啊
<5-13,Leonard>...that time when I proposed to you in bed?

230
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,800
<5-13,Leonard>你当时一脸惊讶  说"你说毛呢"
<5-13,Leonard>And you were all, like, "What are you doing?"

231
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,820
<5-13,Leonard>真是笑死人了
<5-13,Leonard>That was so funny.

232
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,710
<5-13,Leonard>太好笑了
<5-13,Leonard>So funny.

233
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,430
<5-14,Penny>一点都不好笑
<5-14,Penny>It's not funny.

234
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,730
<5-15,Leonard>让笑点再酝酿一会
<5-15,Leonard>Give it a minute.

235
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,160
<5-15,Leonard>嘴角是不是要扬起微笑啦
<5-15,Leonard>Is that a little smile I see there?

236
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,070
<5-15,Leonard>我还是闪吧
<5-15,Leonard>I should go.

237
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,440
<6-1,Howard>我刚刚在想
<6-1,Howard>Hey, I was thinking.

238
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,630
<6-1,Howard>我们结婚时的第一支舞蹈
<6-1,Howard>For our first dance at the wedding,

239
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,860
<6-1,Howard>我们学电影《辣身舞》里的最后那支舞怎么样
<6-1,Howard>what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?

240
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,650
<6-2,Bernadette>-你说笑的吧  -说真的
<6-2,Bernadette>- You're kidding. - No,

241
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,990
<6-2,Bernadette>来嘛
<6-2,Bernadette>come on.

242
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,450
<6-3,Howard>那该有多酷啊
<6-3,Howard>How cool would that be?

243
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,820
<6-3,Howard>我奔向你的臂弯
<6-3,Howard>Me running into your arms...

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,760
<6-5,Howard>当然啦  有什么好不开心的
<6-5,Howard>Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be?

247
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,230
<6-5,Howard>我就要迎娶我的梦中情人了
<6-5,Howard>You know, I'm marrying the girl of my dreams,

248
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,960
<6-5,Howard>而且我也终于说服我妈
<6-5,Howard>and I finally got my mother to agree

249
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,500
<6-5,Howard>不跟着咱们去度蜜月了
<6-5,Howard>not to come on our honeymoon.

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,310
<6-5,Howard>是航空航天局打来的
<6-5,Howard>Oh, it's NASA.

251

<6-5,Howard>我是沃罗威茨
<6-5,Howard>Wolowitz.

252
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,630
<6-5,Howard>戴夫  怎么了

<6-5,Howard>好的  回头聊
<6-5,Howard>Okay, talk soon.

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,720
<6-6,Bernadette>什么天大的好消息呀
<6-6,Bernadette>What's so great?

259
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,400
<6-7,Howard>看来我还是要上太空了
<6-7,Howard>It looks like I'm going into space after all.

260
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,210
<6-8,Bernadette>华仔  这太棒了
<6-8,Bernadette>Oh, Howie, that's wonderful!

261
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,210
<6-9,Howard>是挺棒
<6-9,Howard>Uh-huh, wonderful.

262
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,680
<6-10,Bernadette>怎么回事  他们不是把你的任务取消了吗
<6-10,Bernadette>What happened? I thought they canceled your mission.

263
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,540
<6-11,Howard>是取消了
<6-11,Howard>Th-They did.

264
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,220
<6-11,Howard>可是航空航天局很想把我的望远镜装上太空站
<6-11,Howard>But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station,

265
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,280
<6-11,Howard>所以他们要让我提前升空
<6-11,Howard>so they're putting me on an earlier launch.

266
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,140
<6-13,Howard>-什么时候  -下周五
<6-13,Howard>- When?  - A...week from Friday.

<6-14,Bernadette>什么  可咱们的婚礼就在那个周日呀
<6-14,Bernadette>What? We're getting married that Sunday.

268
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,540
<6-14,Bernadette>说的没错
<6-14,Bernadette>You're right!

269
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,520
<6-15,Howard>我  我不能去太空
<6-15,Howard>I-I can't go to space.

270
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,370
<6-15,Howard>我要结婚
<6-15,Howard>I have to get married,

271
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,920
<6-15,Howard>这个理由没人能反驳
<6-15,Howard>and no one can say that's not a good reason.

272
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,110
<6-15,Howard>我这就打回给他
<6-15,Howard>I'll call him back.

273
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,310
<6-16,Bernadette>等一下  我不想成为阻碍你的那个人
<6-16,Bernadette>Wait. I don't want to be the one who stands in your way.

274
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,130
<6-17,Howard>可惜  你已经是了  米已成炊了
<6-17,Howard>Well, too bad, you already did. It's a done deal.

275
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,450
<6-17,Howard>但是没关系  我原谅你
<6-17,Howard>Oh, well. But I forgive you.

276
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,590
<6-18,Bernadette>不行  我不想这么开始咱们的婚姻
<6-18,Bernadette>No. That's not how I want to start our marriage,

277
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,040
<6-18,Bernadette>我怎么能一上来就毁掉你的梦想呢
<6-18,Bernadette>killing your dream?

278
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,930
<6-18,Bernadette>等你回来咱们再举办婚礼
<6-18,Bernadette>We'll have the wedding when you get back.

279
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,250
<6-19,Howard>可是我们已经做好计划而且喜帖都发了呀
<6-19,Howard>But wh-what about all the plans and the guests?

280
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,600
<6-20,Bernadette>打电话给大家取消就是了
<6-20,Bernadette>We'll call them.

281
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,490
<6-20,Bernadette>虽然我老爸会因为损失了酒席押金
<6-20,Bernadette>Although my dad's gonna go a little nutso

282
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,520
<6-20,Bernadette>而不是太爽
<6-20,Bernadette>over losing his deposits.

283
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,380
<6-21,Howard>没错  他一定会的
<6-21,Howard>You're right, he is!

284
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,750
<6-21,Howard>你爸会气疯的
<6-21,Howard>Your dad's gonna be furious.

285
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,330
<6-21,Howard>他不可能会同意我们延迟婚礼
<6-21,Howard>There's no way he's gonna let us postpone this wedding.

286
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,720
<6-21,Howard>至少咱们努力过了
<6-21,Howard>Well, we tried.

287
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,240
<6-23,Howard>我去跟他谈
<6-23,Howard>I'll talk to him.

288
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,970
<6-22,Bernadette>他不会拒绝他的宝贝女儿的
<6-22,Bernadette>He won't say no to his little girl.

289
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,760
<6-23,Howard>不  应该我去跟他谈
<6-23,Howard>No! I-I should talk to him,

290
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,110
<6-23,Howard>来场男人跟男人间的对话
<6-23,Howard>man to man.

291
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,740
<6-24,Bernadette>但是  华仔  我老爸很凶的
<6-24,Bernadette>But, Howie, my dad can be a bully.

292
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,030
<6-24,Bernadette>他会逼你  不让你上太空的
<6-24,Bernadette>He's gonna make you cancel your space flight.

293
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,320
<6-25,Howard>这样最好...
<6-25,Howard>We can only hope...

294
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,900
<6-25,Howard>是别发生啦
<6-25,Howard>that he doesn't.

295
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,710
<7-1,Sheldon>象挪到二层的
<7-1,Sheldon>Bishop to queen four,

296
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,520
<7-1,Sheldon>四号皇后
<7-1,Sheldon>level two.

297
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,450
<7-1,Sheldon>将军
<7-1,Sheldon>Check.

298
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,730
<7-2,Leonard>谢尔顿
<7-2,Leonard>Sheldon...

299
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,900
<7-2,Leonard>马吃掉象
<7-2,Leonard>knight takes bishop.

300
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,600
<7-2,Leonard>你没事吧
<7-2,Leonard>You all right?

301
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,570
<7-3,Sheldon>我没事
<7-3,Sheldon>I'm fine.

302
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,820
<7-3,Sheldon>真的吗
<7-3,Sheldon>Are you?

303
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,860
<7-4,Leonard>你把你的皇后暴露在敌军之中
<7-4,Leonard>You left your queen exposed from above,

304
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,650
<7-4,Leonard>把你的马困在了角落里
<7-4,Leonard>you trapped your knight in the corner,

305
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,680
<7-4,Leonard>还不停地一边叹气一边说"为什么是我"
<7-4,Leonard>and you keep sighing and saying, "Why me?"

306
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,490
<7-5,Sheldon>好吧
<7-5,Sheldon>Very well.

307
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,390
<7-5,Sheldon>我能问你一个关于女人的问题吗
<7-5,Sheldon>Can I ask you a question about women?

308
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,610
<7-6,Leonard>我们去年不是买了那本书给你嘛
<7-6,Leonard>We got you that book last year.

309
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,230
<7-6,Leonard>那里面的东西还不够全面吗
<7-6,Leonard>Wasn't everything in there?

310
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,900
<7-7,Sheldon>不是  我跟艾米有点感情问题
<7-7,Sheldon>No, I'm having a relationship problem with Amy.

311
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,470
<7-7,Sheldon>顺便说一句  我看完那本书就做噩梦
<7-7,Sheldon>And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.

312
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,850
<7-8,Leonard>我跟佩妮最近也闹得很僵
<7-8,Leonard>Well, if it makes you feel any better,

313
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,620
<7-8,Leonard>也许这样能让你觉得好受点
<7-8,Leonard>I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.

314
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,850
<7-9,Sheldon>你看咱俩现在  莱纳德
<7-9,Sheldon>Look at us, Leonard...

315
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,430
<7-9,Sheldon>都会像普通的男人一样
<7-9,Sheldon>engaging in the social convention of

316
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,050
<7-9,Sheldon>聚在一起抱怨自己家的女人了
<7-9,Sheldon>men bellyaching about their ol' ladies.

317
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,710
<7-10,Leonard>是啊
<7-10,Leonard>I guess we are.

318
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,760
<7-10,Leonard>那说说吧  你们怎么了
<7-10,Leonard>So, what's going on?

319
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,400
<7-11,Sheldon>信不信由你
<7-11,Sheldon>Believe it or not,

320
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,910
<7-11,Sheldon>艾米开始想尽办法哄我开心
<7-11,Sheldon>Amy has embarked on a campaign

321
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,150
<7-11,Sheldon>就为了增进
<7-11,Sheldon>to increase my feelings for her

322
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,210
<7-11,Sheldon>我对她的感情
<7-11,Sheldon>by making me happy.

323
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,720
<7-12,Leonard>我深表同情  你肯定觉得"很不好受"
<7-12,Leonard>I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you.

324
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,740
<7-13,Sheldon>简直糟透了
<7-13,Sheldon>It's awful.

325
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,800
<7-13,Sheldon>今早  她替我打点好一切
<7-13,Sheldon>This morning, she arranged for me

326
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,820
<7-13,Sheldon>让我当一天全美铁路客运公司的小售票员
<7-13,Sheldon>to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day.

327
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,920
<7-13,Sheldon>通常  这种机会只提供给小孩子
<7-13,Sheldon>It-It's usually only open to children.

328
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,700
<7-13,Sheldon>她逼人家为我破例了
<7-13,Sheldon>She got them to make an exception.

329
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,570
<7-14,Leonard>她真无耻
<7-14,Leonard>Shame on her.

330
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,990
<7-15,Sheldon>他们让我吹哨子了  莱纳德
<7-15,Sheldon>They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.

331
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,710
<7-16,Leonard>她还真有两下子
<7-16,Leonard>She's good.

332
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,940
<7-17,Sheldon>就是啊  而且事态愈发严重了
<7-17,Sheldon>I know. And it gets worse.

333
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,840
<7-17,Sheldon>她的努力已经开始让我
<7-17,Sheldon>Her efforts are causing me

334
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,990
<7-17,Sheldon>在不恰当的时候
<7-17,Sheldon>to have affectionate feelings for her

335
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,390
<7-17,Sheldon>对她想入非非了
<7-17,Sheldon>at inappropriate times.

336
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,280
<7-18,Leonard>你是指在床上或是在你冲凉的时候吗
<7-18,Leonard>You mean, like in bed or in the shower?

337
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,510
<7-18,Leonard>才不是呢
<7-18,Leonard>No!

338
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,800
<7-19,Sheldon>你能别再引用那本万恶淫书中的句子了吗
<7-19,Sheldon>Would you please stop referencing that infernal book?

339
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,920
<7-19,Sheldon>比如说  今天早上
<7-19,Sheldon>For example, this morning,

340
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,160
<7-19,Sheldon>我正在计算真空条件下虚粒子的
<7-19,Sheldon>I was calculating the random motion

341
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
<7-19,Sheldon>无规则运动
<7-19,Sheldon>of virtual particles in a vacuum,

342
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,070
<7-19,Sheldon>突然间那些虚粒子
<7-19,Sheldon>when suddenly the particles morphed

343
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,380
<7-19,Sheldon>变形成了艾米的头皮屑
<7-19,Sheldon>into an image of Amy's dandruff...

344
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,510
<7-19,Sheldon>慢慢地从她的头上倾泻而下
<7-19,Sheldon>...gently cascading down onto her pale,

345
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,730
<7-19,Sheldon>落在她苍白又微微隆起的肩膀上
<7-19,Sheldon>slightly hunched shoulders.

346
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,030
<7-19,Sheldon>这个女巫到底对我下了什么药啊  莱纳德
<7-19,Sheldon>What has that vixen done to me, Leonard?

347
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,550
<7-19,Sheldon>我怎么才能停止这一切呀
<7-19,Sheldon>And how do I make it stop?

348
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,820
<7-20,Leonard>如果你俩有肉体关系的话
<7-20,Leonard>Well, if you had a physical relationship,

349
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,850
<7-20,Leonard>我会建议你在跟她亲热的过程中求婚
<7-20,Leonard>I'd say propose during sex.

350
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,770
<7-20,Leonard>绝对一招毙命  性趣全无
<7-20,Leonard>Turns out that's a real mood killer.

351
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,520
<7-21,Sheldon>-我猜咱俩现在聊得是你咯  -没错
<7-21,Sheldon>- I assume we're talking about you now?  - Yeah.

352
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,840
<7-23,Sheldon>所以这种社交场合就是这样的吗
<7-23,Sheldon>So, that's how this works?

353
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,190
<7-23,Sheldon>我抱怨几句  然后你再接着抱怨几句
<7-23,Sheldon>I complain, and then you complain,

354
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,380
<7-23,Sheldon>可大家都没什么解决办法
<7-23,Sheldon>and no one offers any solutions?

355
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,400
<7-24,Leonard>基本上就是这样
<7-24,Leonard>Pretty much.

356
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,330
<7-25,Sheldon>怪不得女人们开始占上风了呢
<7-25,Sheldon>Well, no wonder the women are winning.

357
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,990
<8-1,Howard>罗森考斯基先生  你在忙吗
<8-1,Howard>Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?

358
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,810
<8-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>我只是在看些老照片  进来吧
<8-2,Mr. Rostenkowski>Oh, just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.

359
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,340
<8-3,Howard>是家庭照片  还是...
<8-3,Howard>Family pictures, or...?

360
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,610
<8-3,Howard>天哪  那是个死人
<8-3,Howard>H-Holy crap, that's a dead person.

361
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,720
<8-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>我退休前最后一桩谋杀案
<8-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>Last murder case before I retired.

362
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,790
<8-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>这里有多少具死尸
<8-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>How many bodies do you see there?

363
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,910
<8-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>好好数
<8-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>Careful,

364
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,890
<8-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>这个问题很有难度
<8-4,Mr. Rostenkowski>it's a trick question.

365
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,380
<8-5,Howard>我不确定
<8-5,Howard>I'm not sure.

366
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,860
<8-6,Mr. Rostenkowski>算了  你也猜不到
<8-6,Mr. Rostenkowski>Nah, you'll never get it.

367
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,940
<8-6,Mr. Rostenkowski>是来自同一尸体的碎块
<8-6,Mr. Rostenkowski>It's a fraction.

368
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,870
<8-7,Howard>意想不到啊
<8-7,Howard>How about that.

369
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,160
<8-7,Howard>是这样的  先生
<8-7,Howard>Anyway, sir,

370
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,930
<8-7,Howard>我有点事想找你谈谈
<8-7,Howard>I need to talk to you about something.

371
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,290
<8-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>要吃核桃吗
<8-8,Mr. Rostenkowski>Walnut?

372
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,020
<8-9,Howard>不用了  谢谢
<8-9,Howard>No, thank you.

373
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,160
<8-9,Howard>我对核桃过敏
<8-9,Howard>I'm allergic.

374
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,510
<8-10,Mr. Rostenkowski>好的
<8-10,Mr. Rostenkowski>Oh, sure.

375
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,910
<8-10,Mr. Rostenkowski>我搭档也过敏
<8-10,Mr. Rostenkowski>My partner used to have that.

376
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,610
<8-10,Mr. Rostenkowski>他已经死了
<8-10,Mr. Rostenkowski>He's dead now.

377
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,560
<8-11,Howard>死于坚果吗[疯子]
<8-11,Howard>From nuts?

378
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,350
<8-12,Mr. Rostenkowski>不是  被他老婆枪杀的
<8-12,Mr. Rostenkowski>Nah, his wife shot him.

379
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,860
<8-12,Mr. Rostenkowski>不过她是疯子  所以某种意义上来说...
<8-12,Mr. Rostenkowski>But she was nuts, so in a way...

380
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,370
<8-13,Howard>真是好故事
<8-13,Howard>Nice story.

381
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,420
<8-13,Howard>总之
<8-13,Howard>Anyway,

382
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,750
<8-13,Howard>我想跟你谈谈的原因是
<8-13,Howard>the reason I wanted to talk to you is

383
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,720
<8-13,Howard>宇航局把我上太空站的发射提前了
<8-13,Howard>NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.

384
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,310
<8-14,Mr. Rostenkowski>-那又如何  -那就是说
<8-14,Mr. Rostenkowski>- Yeah, so? - So...

385
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,820
<8-15,Howard>发射日期跟我娶你女儿的日期有冲突
<8-15,Howard>the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter.

386
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,410
<8-15,Howard>我知道你想说什么
<8-15,Howard>Now, I know what you're going to say--

387
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,280
<8-15,Howard>我已对伯纳黛特和您家作出承诺
<8-15,Howard>I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family

388
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,540
<8-15,Howard>我鼓起万般勇气来到这里
<8-15,Howard>and I've got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here

389
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,320
<8-15,Howard>提出延期的要求实在是太过分了
<8-15,Howard>and demanding that we postpone this thing.

390
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,120
<8-15,Howard>所以  我明白了也理解了
<8-15,Howard>Well, message heard and understood.

391
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,710
<8-15,Howard>取消去太空站的任务  打扰了
<8-15,Howard>Mission canceled. Thank you.

392
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,470
<8-16,Mr. Rostenkowski>你要去哪
<8-16,Mr. Rostenkowski>Where are you going?

393
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,090
<8-17,Howard>抱歉
<8-17,Howard>I'm sorry.

394
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,910
<8-17,Howard>我可以离开了吗
<8-17,Howard>May I be excused?

395
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,070
<8-18,Mr. Rostenkowski>不可以
<8-18,Mr. Rostenkowski>No, you may not.

396
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,530
<8-18,Mr. Rostenkowski>我来告诉你
<8-18,Mr. Rostenkowski>Let me tell you something.

397
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,240
<8-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>我第一次见到你时
<8-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>When I first met you...

398
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,060
<8-18,Mr. Rostenkowski>你就站在那里听吗
<8-18,Mr. Rostenkowski>You just gonna stand there?

399
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,850
<8-19,Howard>抱歉  我不知道  是要...
<8-19,Howard>I'm sorry, I didn't know, is this going to...

400
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,860
<8-19,Howard>好的  我坐下
<8-19,Howard>Well, I should sit...

401
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,650
<8-19,Howard>我能坐吗...我坐下就是
<8-19,Howard>May I be seat... Well, I'll just sit.

402
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,060
<8-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>我第一次见到你时
<8-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>When I first met you,

403
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,540
<8-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>很不喜欢你
<8-20,Mr. Rostenkowski>I didn't like you.

404
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,750
<8-21,Howard>我知道  先生
<8-21,Howard>I'm aware of that, sir.

405
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,140
<8-22,Mr. Rostenkowski>跟你相处过一段时间后
<8-22,Mr. Rostenkowski>But then you and I had some time together.

406
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
<8-24,Mr. Rostenkowski>还是不喜欢你
<8-24,Mr. Rostenkowski>It did not get better.

407
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,350
<8-25,Howard>好吧
<8-25,Howard>Right, right.

408
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,610
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>你那愚蠢的披头士发型
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>That silly Beatle haircut

409
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,900
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>骑一辆红色小摩托
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>and...you riding around on a red Vespa,

410
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,570
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>还跟你妈妈一起住
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>and you're still living at home with your mother.

411
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,550
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>老实说  我觉得伯纳黛特选择你
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you

412
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,140
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>是为了惩罚我
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>to punish me.

413
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,580
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>然后我听到你要当宇航员的事
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>But then I heard about your astronaut thing,

414
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,170
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>我才意识到
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>and I realized

415
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,800
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>我过于草率的判断你了
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>I judged you too fast.

416
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,840
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>也许你就是最适合我女儿的白马王子
<8-26,Mr. Rostenkowski>Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.

417
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,200
<8-27,Howard>我就是  而且你也知道的
<8-27,Howard>Oh, I am. And just so you know,

418
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,470
<8-27,Howard>即使我不去太空了  我也依旧是宇航员
<8-27,Howard>I'd still be an astronaut, even if I didn't go to space.

419
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,800
<8-27,Howard>我有身份认证卡和宇航局的高尔夫衫
<8-27,Howard>I've got an I.D. card and a NASA golf shirt.

420
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,730
<8-28,Mr. Rostenkowski>不不  你一定得去
<8-28,Mr. Rostenkowski>No, no, you got to go.

421
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,160
<8-28,Mr. Rostenkowski>不应该放弃这样的一个机会
<8-28,Mr. Rostenkowski>You can't turn down an opportunity like this.

422
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,440
<8-29,Howard>那婚礼怎么办
<8-29,Howard>B-But what about the wedding

423
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,080
<8-29,Howard>还有你为婚宴投下去的钱怎么办
<8-29,Howard>and all the money you put down for the reception?

424
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,800
<8-30,Mr. Rostenkowski>这事我烦恼就好
<8-30,Mr. Rostenkowski>You let me worry about that.

425
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,770
<8-30,Mr. Rostenkowski>你安心去那个空间站
<8-30,Mr. Rostenkowski>You go up to that space station,

426
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,870
<8-30,Mr. Rostenkowski>让我为你骄傲
<8-30,Mr. Rostenkowski>and you make me proud.

427
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,090
<8-31,Howard>好吧
<8-31,Howard>Um, okay.

428
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,980
<8-32,Mr. Rostenkowski>你觉得这有什么问题吗
<8-32,Mr. Rostenkowski>You got a problem with that?

429
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,240
<8-33,Howard>好吧  我跟你说老实话
<8-33,Howard>All right, look, I'm gonna level with you.

430
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,820
<8-33,Howard>我很害怕进入太空
<8-33,Howard>I'm terrified about going into space.

431
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,010
<8-33,Howard>要是我回不来怎么办
<8-33,Howard>What if I don't make it back?

432
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,120
<8-34,Mr. Rostenkowski>会没事的  女婿
<8-34,Mr. Rostenkowski>It's gonna be okay, son.

433
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,420
<8-35,Howard>你真的这么想吗
<8-35,Howard>You really think so?

434
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,910
<8-35,Howard>当然
<8-35,Howard>Of course.

435
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,650
<8-36,Mr. Rostenkowski>伯纳黛特那么漂亮
<8-36,Mr. Rostenkowski>A pretty girl like Bernadette...

436
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,200
<8-36,Mr. Rostenkowski>肯定会找到新归宿
<8-36,Mr. Rostenkowski>she'll find a new guy.

441
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,560
<9-6,Leonard>我一直在想那天
<9-6,Leonard>I've been thinking about what I said

442
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,380
<9-6,Leonard>我们上床时我说过的话
<9-6,Leonard>when we were in bed the other night.

00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,790
<9-8,Leonard>你一直都还没回答我呢

<9-14,Leonard>-你上车打电话给我谈吧  -别想
<9-14,Leonard>- Do you want to call me from the car? - No!

451
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,930
<9-16,Leonard>还处理的挺不错嘛
<9-16,Leonard>Think I played that pretty well.
