00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,860
<1-1,Sheldon>回到大自然的感觉真好
<1-1,Sheldon>It's nice to get back to nature.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,590
<1-1,Sheldon>我真该多多这么做
<1-1,Sheldon>Why don't I do this more often?

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,200
<1-1,Sheldon>这森林真美
<1-1,Sheldon>What a beautiful forest.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,520
<1-1,Sheldon>你好呀  小蝴蝶
<1-1,Sheldon>Hello, little butterfly.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,520
<1-1,Sheldon>你叫什么...
<1-1,Sheldon>What's your na...

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,650
<1-2,Leonard>你在干嘛
<1-2,Leonard>Whatcha doing?

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,340
<1-3,Sheldon>我刚沉浸在虚拟现实的乐趣中
<1-3,Sheldon>I was enjoying some virtual reality,

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,120
<1-3,Sheldon>而你这张现实的大脸把我拉了出来
<1-3,Sheldon>until you ruined it with your actual face.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,510
<1-4,Penny>这是什么味儿
<1-4,Penny>What am I smelling?

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,070
<1-5,Sheldon>这是汽车香片
<1-5,Sheldon>Oh, it's car air freshener.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,850
<1-5,Sheldon>我在模拟森林的味道
<1-5,Sheldon>I was simulating the smell of the forest.

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,830
<1-6,Penny>真正的森林可不是这个味儿
<1-6,Penny>That's not what the forest smells like.

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,890
<1-7,Sheldon>我咋知道
<1-7,Sheldon>Well, how would I know?

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,590
<1-8,Leonard>你干嘛意淫自己在户外
<1-8,Leonard>Why are you pretending to be outdoors?

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,870
<1-8,Leonard>你又不喜欢
<1-8,Leonard>You hate it.

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,460
<1-9,Sheldon>艾米给我看了一个有说服力的研究
<1-9,Sheldon>Amy showed me a compelling study

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,110
<1-9,Sheldon>研究证实花点时间待在野外
<1-9,Sheldon>that demonstrated the cognitive benefit

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,960
<1-9,Sheldon>对认知能力有好处
<1-9,Sheldon>of spending time in the wilderness.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,410
<1-10,Leonard>伙计  只要你想
<1-10,Leonard>Buddy, I am ready to drive you

20
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,710
<1-10,Leonard>我随时都可以开车载你去野外
<1-10,Leonard>into the wilderness any time you want

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,530
<1-10,Leonard>然后把你扔那儿
<1-10,Leonard>and leave you there.

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,580
<1-11,Sheldon>随便你笑  但部分参与者
<1-11,Sheldon>Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,330
<1-11,Sheldon>远离所有科技  在树林待了四天后
<1-11,Sheldon>who spent four days in the woods away from all technology

24
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,530
<1-11,Sheldon>记录指出  回来后逻辑思维能力提高了50%
<1-11,Sheldon>reported a 50% gain in reasoning skills upon their return.

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,590
<1-12,Penny>好吧  如果那是真的
<1-12,Penny>Okay, if that's true,

26
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,610
<1-12,Penny>为什么没有出现更多的天才松鼠
<1-12,Penny>why aren't there more genius squirrels?

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,580
<1-13,Sheldon>你可能比我更需要这个
<1-13,Sheldon>You may need this more than I do.

38
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,380
<2-1,Amy>你的茶泡好了
<2-1,Amy>Here's your tea.

39
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,220
<2-2,Sheldon>不要悄悄走近一个坐在圆木上的男人
<2-2,Sheldon>Do not sneak up on a guy when he's sitting on a log.

40
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,780
<2-3,Amy>如果你真的那么想亲近大自然
<2-3,Amy>You know, if you really want to be in nature,

41
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,170
<2-3,Amy>我们何不去租一个小木屋
<2-3,Amy>why don't we rent a cabin?

42
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,510
<2-4,Sheldon>抱歉  你啥时候来的  我都没...
<2-4,Sheldon>Look, I'm sorry, when did you even get here? I...

43
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,320
<2-5,Penny>有个跟我有业务往来的医生
<2-5,Penny>You know, there's a cabin in Big Bear

44
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,500
<2-5,Penny>一直邀我去大熊湖那的一个小木屋
<2-5,Penny>that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,680
<2-6,Leonard>因为那男的想勾搭你吗
<2-6,Leonard>Because he's hitting on you?

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,650
<2-7,Penny>女的
<2-7,Penny>She.

47
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,200
<2-8,Leonard>那就好
<2-8,Leonard>Oh, good.

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,550
<2-9,Penny>但我男女通杀
<2-9,Penny>But I could get her.

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,820
<2-10,Amy>我们周末可以一起去
<2-10,Amy>We could all go for the weekend.

<2-10,Amy>It'll be fun.

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,900
<2-11,Sheldon>好吧  借过
<2-11,Sheldon>Yeah... Excuse me.

52
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,170
<2-11,Sheldon>查"好玩"这个词  再跟我谈
<2-11,Sheldon>Here, look up "Fun", get back to me.

53
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,870
<2-12,Leonard>咱俩可以去好好过个周末啊
<2-12,Leonard>You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.

54
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,030
<2-13,Penny>好啊
<2-13,Penny>Sure.

<2-14,Amy>Come on, Sheldon, let's go with them.

56
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,480
<2-15,Sheldon>我不要
<2-15,Sheldon>I hardly think so.

57
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,000
<2-15,Sheldon>你们一定要跟以下生物问好
<2-15,Sheldon>You be sure and say hello to

<2-15,Sheldon>oh, and last, but not least,

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,860
<2-15,Sheldon>玩吉他的少男少女们
<2-15,Sheldon>teenagers with guitars.

62
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,700
<2-16,Penny>我问问能不能出借
<2-16,Penny>I'll see if it's available.

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,140
<2-17,Amy>如果那个研究是真的
<2-17,Amy>You know, if that study's real,

64
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,250
<2-17,Amy>莱纳德回来后可能就会比你聪明哦
<2-17,Amy>Leonard might come back smarter than you.

65
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,860
<2-18,Sheldon>-你这是在逼我就范吗  -是的
<2-18,Sheldon>- Are you trying to manipulate me? - Yes.

66
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,970
<2-20,Sheldon>干得好  很成功  我们去
<2-20,Sheldon>Well done, it worked, we're going.

67
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,980
<2-21,Amy>好棒
<2-21,Amy>Yay!

68
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,270
<3-1,Bernadette>别这样  拉杰
<3-1,Bernadette>Come on, Raj,

69
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,310
<3-1,Bernadette>让我帮你拿个袋吧
<3-1,Bernadette>give me a bag.

70
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,080
<3-2,Raj>不行  你有孕在身
<3-2,Raj>No, no, you're pregnant.

71

<3-2,Raj>你的力气要用来
<3-2,Raj>The only thing you carry

72
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,010
<3-2,Raj>"帮"人类孕育美好明天的希望
<3-2,Raj>is our hope for a better tomorrow.

73
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,930
<3-3,Howard>你去哪儿了
<3-3,Howard>Hey, where you been?

74
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,480
<3-4,Bernadette>拉杰载我去看产科医生
<3-4,Bernadette>Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor

75
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,130
<3-4,Bernadette>然后我们顺便去了一趟杂货店
<3-4,Bernadette>and then we swung by the grocery store.

76
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,260
<3-5,Howard>你有买全麦饼干吗
<3-5,Howard>Did you get graham crackers?

77
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,340
<3-5,Howard>我是说  宝宝还好吗
<3-5,Howard>I mean, are... what... is the baby okay?

78
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,460
<3-6,Bernadette>买了  很好
<3-6,Bernadette>Yes and yes.

79
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,900
<3-7,Howard>我不知道你今天办事需要帮忙
<3-7,Howard>I didn't know you needed help running errands today.

80
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,550
<3-8,Bernadette>不用啊  但拉杰主动来帮忙
<3-8,Bernadette>I didn't, but Raj volunteered.

81
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,260
<3-9,Howard>是吗
<3-9,Howard>Really?

82
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,780
<3-10,Bernadette>是啊  自从你告诉他我怀孕后
<3-10,Bernadette>Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant,

83
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,790
<3-10,Bernadette>他对我真是呵护备至
<3-10,Bernadette>he's really been making a fuss over me.

84
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,390
<3-11,Howard>这样也挺好的
<3-11,Howard>Oh. Well, I guess that's kind of sweet.

85
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,850
<3-12,Raj>妮妮  我刚给你转发了一张
<3-12,Raj>Bernie, I just forwarded you a list

86
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,260
<3-12,Raj>洛杉矶前五位哺乳专家的名单
<3-12,Raj>of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles.

87
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,290
<3-12,Raj>虽然我有最爱的人选
<3-12,Raj>I know my favorite,

88
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,500
<3-12,Raj>但我还是想听听你的意见
<3-12,Raj>but I'd love to hear what you think.

89
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,220
<3-13,Howard>突然开始变味了
<3-13,Howard>And it just got weird.

90
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,310
<4-1,Penny>艾米在楼下了
<4-1,Penny>Hey. Amy's downstairs.

91
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,970
<4-2,Leonard>好的  马上走
<4-2,Leonard>Okay, one sec.

92
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,120
<4-3,Penny>你头上戴的是什么
<4-3,Penny>Uh, what-what you got goin' on here?

93
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,380
<4-4,Leonard>我买了一顶棒球帽
<4-4,Leonard>I bought a baseball cap.

94
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,670
<4-5,Penny>我看出来了
<4-5,Penny>I can see that.

95
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,960
<4-5,Penny>帽子是哪个球队呀
<4-5,Penny>What team did you get?

96
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,440
<4-6,Leonard>《哈利波特》的赫奇帕奇学院
<4-6,Leonard>Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.

97
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,520
<4-7,Penny>去森林戴啥帽子呀
<4-7,Penny>Well, we'll be in the woods.

98
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
<4-8,Sheldon>我可以走了
<4-8,Sheldon>I'm ready to go.

99
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,800
<4-9,Leonard>你有什么话想要对他说吗
<4-9,Leonard>Anything you'd like to say to him?

100
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,050
<4-10,Penny>谢尔顿  帽子不错
<4-10,Penny>Nice hat, Sheldon.

101
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,940
<4-11,Sheldon>谢谢
<4-11,Sheldon>Thanks.

102
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,730
<4-12,Leonard>你干嘛就欺负我
<4-12,Leonard>Why are you so mean to me?

103
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,950
<5-1,Howard>你到底在看什么啊
<5-1,Howard>What the hell are you watching?

104
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,290
<5-2,Bernadette>拉杰在网上找了这些生孩子的视频
<5-2,Bernadette>Raj found all these childbirth videos online.

105
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,750
<5-2,Bernadette>这是一个女人在河里生孩子
<5-2,Bernadette>This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.

106
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,630
<5-3,Howard>好吧  那是我这辈子见过
<5-3,Howard>Okay, that is the least Jewish thing

107
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,120
<5-3,Howard>最不犹太风的事情了
<5-3,Howard>I've ever seen in my life.

108
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,530
<5-3,Howard>你不觉得拉杰对宝宝的事
<5-3,Howard>You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away

109
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,860
<5-3,Howard>有点过于上心吗
<5-3,Howard>with all the baby stuff?

110
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,840
<5-4,Bernadette>不觉得啊
<5-4,Bernadette>I don't think so.

111
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,090
<5-4,Bernadette>他只是想要参与进来而已
<5-4,Bernadette>He just wants to be part of the experience.

112
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,020
<5-5,Howard>好吧  你说是就是吧
<5-5,Howard>All right, if you say so.

113
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,210
<5-5,Howard>盒子里是什么
<5-5,Howard>What's in the box?

114
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,620
<5-6,Bernadette>是一个超声波麦克风
<5-6,Bernadette>Oh, it's an ultrasonic microphone

115
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,360
<5-6,Bernadette>用它可以听到宝宝的心跳
<5-6,Bernadette>so we can hear the baby's heartbeat.

116
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,580
<5-7,Howard>挺酷啊
<5-7,Howard>That's cool.

117
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,790
<5-7,Howard>我们能试试吗
<5-7,Howard>Can we try it?

118
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,720
<5-8,Bernadette>那个其实是拉杰订的
<5-8,Bernadette>Actually, Raj ordered it.

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,650
<5-8,Bernadette>他让我保证会等到他来了再用
<5-8,Bernadette>He made me promise to wait till he was here.

120
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,880
<5-9,Howard>这样他才能...
<5-9,Howard>So he can be...

121
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,980
<5-9,Howard>参与进来吗
<5-9,Howard>part of the experience?

122
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,230
<5-10,Bernadette>是啊
<5-10,Bernadette>Yeah.

123
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,510
<5-11,Howard>真惊讶他居然让我们单独"受孕"
<5-11,Howard>I'm surprised he let us conceive without him.

124
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,920
<5-12,Bernadette>这是他痛处  别在他面前提
<5-12,Bernadette>It's a sore spot-- don't bring it up.

125
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,700
<6-1,Penny>好有爱  好有乡村气息
<6-1,Penny>It's so cute and rustic up here.

126
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,350
<6-1,Penny>对啊
<6-1,Penny>I know.

127
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,400
<6-2,Leonard>你有看到他们还有录影带出租店吗
<6-2,Leonard>Did you see they still have a video rental place?

128
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,490
<6-2,Leonard>好像弗州的威廉斯堡历史保护区
<6-2,Leonard>it's like Colonial Williamsburg.

129
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,640
<6-3,Sheldon>手机信号只剩下一格了
<6-3,Sheldon>Well...cell service is down to one bar,

130
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,630
<6-3,Sheldon>如果有人需要找医生
<6-3,Sheldon>so if anyone needs medical attention

131
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,180
<6-3,Sheldon>或者告诉陌生人  他的政治观点很智障
<6-3,Sheldon>or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid,

132
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,140
<6-3,Sheldon>赶紧趁现在
<6-3,Sheldon>now's the time.

133
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,010
<6-4,Amy>你有彻底断过网吗
<6-4,Amy>Have you ever been off the grid before?

134
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,970
<6-5,Sheldon>有过一次
<6-5,Sheldon>Once.

135
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,710
<6-5,Sheldon>是在我的手机没电
<6-5,Sheldon>The battery ran out on my phone.

136
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,620
<6-5,Sheldon>得等我的iPad开机的那段时间
<6-5,Sheldon>I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.

137
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,980
<6-6,Leonard>那次我以为他要把我生吞活剥了
<6-6,Leonard>I was afraid he was gonna eat me.

138
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,160
<7-1,Howard>拉杰到了
<7-1,Howard>Raj just pulled up.

139
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,520
<7-1,Howard>我得跟他说说这事
<7-1,Howard>I'm gonna say something to him.

140
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,690
<7-2,Bernadette>别说了  他一番好意
<7-2,Bernadette>Leave it alone. He means well.

141
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,730
<7-3,Howard>所以你不觉得他需要稍微有点分寸吗
<7-3,Howard>So you don't think he needs to rein it in a little?

142
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,700
<7-4,Bernadette>不用  没觉得
<7-4,Bernadette>No, not really.

143
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,240
<7-5,Howard>你不担心他表现得有点像
<7-5,Howard>And you're not concerned he's acting like

144
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,170
<7-5,Howard>你肚子里的也是他孩子吗
<7-5,Howard>somehow this is his kid, too?

145
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,890
<7-6,Bernadette>他只是给予我关爱和支持
<7-6,Bernadette>He's just trying to be supportive.

146
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,480
<7-7,Howard>单纯关爱和支持
<7-7,Howard>Just supportive.

147
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,220
<7-7,Howard>完全没越界也不过火吗
<7-7,Howard>Not over-the-top in any way?

148
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,150
<7-8,Bernadette>是的
<7-8,Bernadette>No.

149
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,560
<7-9,Raj>大家安安啊
<7-9,Raj>Hello!

150
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,360
<7-9,Raj>此熊是美国零售商Costco出的巨熊
<7-9,Raj>2.6米高  含外送费只要280美元

151
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,870
<7-10,Bernadette>你早就看见他拿着这个了
<7-10,Bernadette>You saw him carrying that.

152
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,240
<7-11,Howard>宇航员都看见了
<7-11,Howard>Astronauts saw him carrying that.

153
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,530
<8-1,Penny>这地方好棒
<8-1,Penny>This place is great!

154
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,230
<8-2,Leonard>那个医生真好  就白白借你用了
<8-2,Leonard>So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.

155
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,480
<8-3,Penny>她要带我去看拉拉女团的演唱会
<8-3,Penny>Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert,

156
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,630
<8-3,Penny>话先别说太早
<8-3,Penny>so hold that thought.

157
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,500
<8-3,Penny>好
<8-3,Penny>Okay.

158
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,900
<8-4,Sheldon>我们要互相检查有没有虱子了吗
<8-4,Sheldon>Should we check each other for ticks?

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,160
<8-5,Amy>谢尔顿  就下车走进屋这段路而已
<8-5,Amy>Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.

160
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,500
<8-6,Sheldon>随你便
<8-6,Sheldon>Oh. Well, suit yourself.

161
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,470
<8-6,Sheldon>谁想检查我身上
<8-6,Sheldon>Who wants to check me?

162
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,600
<8-7,Amy>不过  不怕一万只怕万一嘛
<8-7,Amy>On the other hand, safety first.

163
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,660
<9-1,Amy>大雨大雨一直下
<9-1,Amy>Wow, it's really coming down.

164
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,090
<9-2,Penny>真是衰透了
<9-2,Penny>This sucks.

165
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,690
<9-3,Leonard>踏青是没戏了
<9-3,Leonard>And there goes our hike.

166
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,980
<9-4,Sheldon>太"失望"了
<9-4,Sheldon>Oh, not our hike!

167
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,560
<9-4,Sheldon>现在我们只能保持安全与暖和了
<9-4,Sheldon>Now we have to stay safe and warm.

168
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,820
<9-5,Penny>我们还是能去啊
<9-5,Penny>You know, we could still go.

169
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,230
<9-5,Penny>一点小雨也不会死人
<9-5,Penny>A little rain isn't gonna kill us.

170
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,060
<9-6,Leonard>你跟谢尔顿在雨中出去过吗
<9-6,Leonard>Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?

171
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,870
<9-8,Leonard>-没  -你会祈求雨能弄死你
<9-8,Leonard>- No. - You'll wish it would kill you.

172
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,930
<9-9,Amy>我们现在干嘛
<9-9,Amy>So what do we do now?

173
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,460
<9-10,Leonard>这里有些桌游啊
<9-10,Leonard>They have some board games.

174
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,830
<9-11,Sheldon>大多数的叠叠乐积木都不见了
<9-11,Sheldon>Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing

175
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,800
<9-11,Sheldon>而拼字游戏只剩七个字母砖
<9-11,Sheldon>and the Scrabble only has seven tiles,

176
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,150
<9-11,Sheldon>除非你想叠一个看起来很垃圾的塔
<9-11,Sheldon>so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure

177
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,130
<9-11,Sheldon>外加"SHNERPF"字样在一旁  否则拉倒吧
<9-11,Sheldon>with the word "SHNERPF" next to it, move on.

178
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,790
<9-12,Penny>我们来生火吧
<9-12,Penny>Hey, let's light a fire.

179
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,560
<9-13,Amy>感觉好舒服
<9-13,Amy>Ooh, that sounds cozy.

180
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,610
<9-14,Leonard>我好像没有生过真的火
<9-14,Leonard>I don't think I've lit a real fire before.

181
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,610
<9-15,Sheldon>只是很基础的热力学
<9-15,Sheldon>Ah, it's basic thermodynamics.

182
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,040
<9-15,Sheldon>我们俩肯定能搞定
<9-15,Sheldon>I'm sure we can figure that out.

183
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,120
<9-16,Leonard>我可以把木头按圆锥状叠来促进空气流动
<9-16,Leonard>I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.

184
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,060
<9-17,Sheldon>这的确能为燃烧提供最足的氧气
<9-17,Sheldon>That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.

185
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,330
<9-18,Leonard>对  所以我们只需要...
<9-18,Leonard>Right. So all we need is to...

186
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,930
<9-19,Penny>搞定
<9-19,Penny>Got it.

187
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,030
<9-20,Leonard>生火装置是科学家发明的
<9-20,Leonard>A scientist made that.

188
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,220
<10-1,Howard>拉杰  你是我全世界最好的朋友
<10-1,Howard>Look, Raj, you're my best friend in the world

189
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,430
<10-1,Howard>我也很感谢你对这孩子这么上心
<10-1,Howard>and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.

190
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,130
<10-2,Raj>别客气  我的荣幸
<10-2,Raj>Please, my pleasure.

191
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,720
<10-3,Bernadette>我跟华仔也很愿意让你全程参与进来
<10-3,Bernadette>And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.

192
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,440
<10-4,Howard>但我们得设一些界线
<10-4,Howard>But we have to set some boundaries.

193
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,250
<10-5,Raj>我不懂了
<10-5,Raj>I don't understand.

194
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,370
<10-6,Howard>这孩子不是我们三个人的
<10-6,Howard>The three of us aren't having this baby.

195
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,160
<10-6,Howard>是我们两个人的
<10-6,Howard>Just the two of us.

196
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,170
<10-7,Howard>好  我懂了
<10-7,Howard>Okay. Yeah, I get it.

197
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,020
<10-7,Howard>我不乱插手了
<10-7,Howard>I'll back off.

198
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,370
<10-8,Howard>谢谢你能理解
<10-8,Howard>Thanks for understanding.

199
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,970
<10-8,Howard>那当然
<10-8,Howard>Of course.

200
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,250
<10-9,Raj>我给你们留点空间吧
<10-9,Raj>I'll give you guys some space.

201
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,800
<10-9,Raj>帮你们把这玩意弄走  别碍事了
<10-9,Raj>Let me just get this out of your way.

202
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,720
<10-10,Howard>你需要帮忙吗
<10-10,Howard>You need some help?

203
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
<10-11,Raj>不用  我能行
<10-11,Raj>No, I got it.

204
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,570
<10-12,Bernadette>拉杰  拉杰  等等
<10-12,Bernadette>Raj... Raj, wait.

205
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,510
<10-13,Raj>别说了  伯纳黛特
<10-13,Raj>Please, Bernadette.

206
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,350
<10-13,Raj>让我带着最后一点尊严离去吧
<10-13,Raj>Let me leave with my dignity.

207
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,820
<11-1,Penny>你们想玩一个喝酒游戏吗
<11-1,Penny>Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?

208
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,920
<11-2,Sheldon>那啥...我们根本赢不了啊
<11-2,Sheldon>Oh, well now, well now, we'll never win.

209
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,670
<11-2,Sheldon>这项活动你老玩
<11-2,Sheldon>You always play the drinking game.

210
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,020
<11-3,Penny>不是"喝酒"这游戏  是喝酒玩的游戏
<11-3,Penny>Not the drinking game, a drinking game.

211
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,240
<11-4,Leonard>说句公道话  两种她都是高手
<11-4,Leonard>To be fair, good at both.

212
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,000
<11-5,Amy>怎么玩
<11-5,Amy>What's the game?

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,530
<11-5,Amy>好  这个游戏叫"我从未做过"
<11-5,Amy>All right, it's called Never Have I Ever.

214
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,520
<11-6,Penny>规则特别简单
<11-6,Penny>The rules are simple.

215
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,970
<11-6,Penny>每人说一件自己从未做过的事
<11-6,Penny>Someone says something they've never done,

216
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,830
<11-6,Penny>但其他人谁做过  谁就得喝酒
<11-6,Penny>but if you have done it, you take a drink.

217
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,050
<11-7,Leonard>我从未玩过这个游戏
<11-7,Leonard>I've never played that before.

218
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,880
<11-8,Sheldon>等一下
<11-8,Sheldon>Hey, now, wait.

219
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,860
<11-8,Sheldon>我们已经开始了吗  我需要喝酒吗
<11-8,Sheldon>Have we started? Do I drink?

220
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,730
<11-8,Sheldon>-到底怎么回事  -好了
<11-8,Sheldon>- What is happening? - Okay.

221
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,510
<11-9,Penny>冷静一点  我先来
<11-9,Penny>Calm down. I'll go first.

222
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,950
<11-9,Penny>好  我看看啊
<11-9,Penny>All right, let's see.

223
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,900
<11-10,Amy>我从未...
<11-10,Amy>Never have I ever...

224
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,320
<11-10,Amy>她正在努力回想一件她没做过的事
<11-10,Amy>She's trying to think of something she's never done before.

225
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,210
<11-10,Amy>这够她想好久了
<11-10,Amy>This could take a while.

226
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,330
<11-11,Penny>好好笑哦
<11-11,Penny>Very funny.

227
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,940
<11-12,Leonard>我从未...
<11-12,Leonard>Okay, never have I ever...

228
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,540
<11-11,Penny>算了吧
<11-11,Penny>Yeah, you know what?

229
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,320
<11-11,Penny>还是先从你们开始吧
<11-11,Penny>Let's just circle back.

230
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,470
<11-12,Leonard>好的  我先来
<11-12,Leonard>Okay, I'll go.

231
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,130
<11-12,Leonard>我从未被逮捕过
<11-12,Leonard>Never have I ever been arrested.

232
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,410
<11-13,Sheldon>那我就得喝了
<11-13,Sheldon>So I drink.

233
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,400
<11-14,Amy>不  只有你做过才需要喝
<11-14,Amy>No, it's only if you've done it.

234
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,840
<11-15,Sheldon>懂了
<11-15,Sheldon>Got it.

235
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,780
<11-16,Amy>真不敢相信你居然被逮捕过
<11-16,Amy>I can't believe you've been arrested.

236
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,060
<11-17,Sheldon>我还不敢相信佩妮没被逮捕过呢
<11-17,Sheldon>I can't believe Penny hasn't.

237
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,260
<11-18,Penny>谢尔顿  你犯了什么事啊
<11-18,Penny>Sheldon, what did you do?

238
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,850
<11-19,Sheldon>这不是一件值得骄傲的事
<11-19,Sheldon>Well, I'm not proud of it,

239
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,730
<11-19,Sheldon>不过
<11-19,Sheldon>but...

240
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,050
<11-19,Sheldon>我曾经乱穿马路
<11-19,Sheldon>I jaywalked.

241
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,280
<11-20,Leonard>我的妈呀  这不就跟恐怖片一样吗
<11-20,Leonard>Oh, no, it's like a horror movie.

242
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,720
<11-20,Leonard>我们和一个疯子一起困在小木屋里
<11-20,Leonard>We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac.

243
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,050
<11-21,Amy>我真惊讶你居然做了这种事
<11-21,Amy>I'm surprised you would do that.

244
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,070
<11-22,Sheldon>我从街道的中间乱穿的
<11-22,Sheldon>No, I crossed in the middle of the street.

245
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,340
<11-22,Sheldon>通常情况下  我不会做这种事
<11-22,Sheldon>And normally, I wouldn't,

246
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,230
<11-22,Sheldon>但我看见了一个虎视眈眈的女童子军
<11-22,Sheldon>but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout,

247
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,580
<11-22,Sheldon>当时又恰逢女童军饼干销售旺季
<11-22,Sheldon>and it was the heart of cookie season.

248
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,920
<11-22,Sheldon>总之  路边站了一个警察
<11-22,Sheldon>Anyway, there was a police officer,

249
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,210
<11-22,Sheldon>他目睹了整个过程
<11-22,Sheldon>and he witnessed the whole thing.

250
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,940
<11-23,Penny>什么  他就为了这个逮捕你吗
<11-23,Penny>What-- he arrested you for that?

251
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,310
<11-24,Sheldon>不  他什么也没做
<11-24,Sheldon>No, he didn't do anything.

252
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,920
<11-24,Sheldon>于是我说  "你刚才看见
<11-24,Sheldon>So I said, "You just saw me jaywalk.

253
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,400
<11-24,Sheldon>我乱穿马路了  你是白吃干饭的吗"
<11-24,Sheldon>Why aren't you doing your job?" You know?

254
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,730
<11-24,Sheldon>"也许我应该以
<11-24,Sheldon>"M-Maybe I should arrest you

255
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,920
<11-24,Sheldon>冒充警察罪逮捕你才对"
<11-24,Sheldon>for-for impersonating a police officer."

256
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,600
<11-25,Penny>然后你就被逮捕了
<11-25,Penny>And then you got arrested.

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,650
<11-26,Sheldon>这也是我被逮捕的原因
<11-26,Sheldon>Oh, and how.

258
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,130
<12-1,Howard>我觉得自己犯了一个大错
<12-1,Howard>I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.

259
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,980
<12-2,Bernadette>没错
<12-2,Bernadette>Yeah.

260
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,670
<12-2,Bernadette>不过从另一方面来说
<12-2,Bernadette>But on the other hand,

261
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,230
<12-3,Howard>我又不是要跟他断绝来往
<12-3,Howard>I didn't kick him out of our lives.

262
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,750
<12-3,Howard>我不过让他别太越界而已
<12-3,Howard>I just asked him to back off a little.

263
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,210
<12-4,Bernadette>没错
<12-4,Bernadette>Yeah.

264
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,290
<12-5,Howard>怎么了  你要哭了吗
<12-5,Howard>What? Are you gonna cry?

265
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,330
<12-6,Bernadette>没错
<12-6,Bernadette>Yeah!

266
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,390
<12-7,Howard>你这是孕期荷尔蒙作祟  还是真的很难过啊
<12-7,Howard>Is it baby hormones or actually sad?

267
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,880
<12-8,Bernadette>我自己也分不出来
<12-8,Bernadette>I can't tell anymore!

268
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,230
<12-9,Howard>我马上去找他
<12-9,Howard>I'll go get him.

269
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,010
<12-10,Bernadette>把熊熊也带回来
<12-10,Bernadette>And bring back the bear!

270
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,480
<13-1,Leonard>这个游戏太危险了
<13-1,Leonard>This game's dangerous.

271
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,900
<13-1,Leonard>我轻轻松松就能让你惹上麻烦
<13-1,Leonard>I could get you in trouble.

272
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,940
<13-2,Penny>此话怎讲
<13-2,Penny>How?

273

<13-3,Leonard>用谢尔顿的牙刷来刷水槽
<13-3,Leonard>used Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink.

275
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,610
<13-4,Penny>好呀  你想这么玩是吧
<13-4,Penny>Fine, is that how you want to play this?

276
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,840
<13-4,Penny>很好  我从未
<13-4,Penny>All right, never have I ever come up

277
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,170
<13-4,Penny>给自己的生殖器取过小名
<13-4,Penny>with a nickname for my own genitals.

278
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,560
<13-5,Leonard>我就不该把《鼠来宝》那三只的名字告诉你
<13-5,Leonard>Never should've told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.

279
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,160
<13-6,Amy>好了  该我了
<13-6,Amy>Okay. My turn.

281
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,110
<13-6,Amy>让我女友在床上爽歪歪
<13-6,Amy>completely rocked my girlfriend's world in bed.

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,840
<13-7,Sheldon>艾米...
<13-7,Sheldon>Amy...

<13-11,Sheldon>All right, my turn.

288
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,100
<13-11,Sheldon>我知道了
<13-11,Sheldon>Oh, I know.

289
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,830
<13-11,Sheldon>我从未因为觉得我老婆不善理财
<13-11,Sheldon>Never have I ever kept a secret bank account,

290
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,450
<13-11,Sheldon>而有一个放私房钱的银行账号
<13-11,Sheldon>because I think my wife can't handle money.

291
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,770
<13-11,Sheldon>我赢了吗
<13-11,Sheldon>Did I win?

292
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,070
<13-11,Sheldon>我觉得好像是我赢了
<13-11,Sheldon>I feel like I won.

293
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,690
<13-12,Penny>我真不敢相信
<13-12,Penny>I can't believe this.

294
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,550
<13-12,Penny>你知道我赚得比你多对吧
<13-12,Penny>You realize I make more money than you?

295
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,650
<13-13,Leonard>我不是  我知道  但可有啥关系啊
<13-13,Leonard>I don't, I know, but this isn't a big deal.

296
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,570
<13-13,Leonard>我不过是私下存了点小钱嘛
<13-13,Leonard>It's just a little savings I put aside.

297
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,430
<13-14,Penny>我们已经结婚了
<13-14,Penny>We're married.

298
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,390
<13-14,Penny>我们应该分享一切
<13-14,Penny>We're supposed to share everything.

299
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,490
<13-15,Leonard>你是指  分享你的巨额信用卡账单吗
<13-15,Leonard>What-- you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?

300
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,790
<13-16,Sheldon>我要宣布了
<13-16,Sheldon>I'm calling it.

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,520
<14-1,Raj>我很感激你来道歉
<14-1,Raj>I appreciate the apology,

303
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,950
<14-1,Raj>但这真的没有必要
<14-1,Raj>but it's really not necessary.

304
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,210
<14-1,Raj>是我过界了
<14-1,Raj>I overstepped my bounds.

305
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,060
<14-2,Howard>不  拉杰  你做得很棒
<14-2,Howard>No, Raj, you've been great.

306
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,740
<14-2,Howard>但我也需要开始承担我的那部分责任了
<14-2,Howard>I just, I need to start doing my part around here.

307
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,630
<14-3,Bernadette>本宫听到了
<14-3,Bernadette>I hear that.

308
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,490
<14-4,Raj>如果是这样的话
<14-4,Raj>Well, if that's the case,

309
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,800
<14-4,Raj>有什么需要我帮忙的吗
<14-4,Raj>is there anything I can do to help?

310
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,950
<14-5,Howard>目前没有
<14-5,Howard>Well, not right now.

311
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,900
<14-5,Howard>不过我们可以试试你给我们买的麦克风
<14-5,Howard>But we could try out that microphone you got us,

312
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,410
<14-5,Howard>听听孩子的心跳
<14-5,Howard>and listen to the baby's heartbeat.

313
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,280
<14-5,Howard>真的吗
<14-5,Howard>Really?

314
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,320
<14-6,Raj>我可以跟你们一起听吗
<14-6,Raj>It's okay if I listen with you?!

315
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,490
<14-7,Bernadette>当然了
<14-7,Bernadette>Of course.

316
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,690
<14-8,Raj>那我能往你的肚肚上射超声波胶吗
<14-8,Raj>Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?

317
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,640
<14-9,Howard>瞧瞧啊
<14-9,Howard>Hey, look at that.

318
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,710
<14-9,Howard>又开始变味了
<14-9,Howard>It's weird again.

319
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,550
<15-1,Leonard>好的  你完全有权生气
<15-1,Leonard>Okay, you have every right to be mad.

320
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,590
<15-1,Leonard>你说的也是实话
<15-1,Leonard>And what you said is true.

321
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,010
<15-1,Leonard>你确实赚得比我多
<15-1,Leonard>You do make more money than me.

322
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,690
<15-1,Leonard>我没有权做出那种事
<15-1,Leonard>So I had no right to do what I did.

323
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,180
<15-1,Leonard>真的很对不起
<15-1,Leonard>And I'm so sorry.

<15-2,Penny>How long have you had this secret account?

326
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,860
<15-3,Leonard>有几年了  但只是每个月存上几块钱
<15-3,Leonard>A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside

327
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,540
<15-3,Leonard>以备不时之需
<15-3,Leonard>every month for emergencies.

<15-6,Penny>what I could do with that kind of money?

333
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,510
<15-7,Leonard>我知道  所以我才藏起来了
<15-7,Leonard>No, I do, and that's why I hid it.

334
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,420
<15-8,Penny>你要是不用  这钱有什么意义
<15-8,Penny>What good is it if you don't use it?

335
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,570
<15-9,Leonard>你有你爱但是从不穿的鞋
<15-9,Leonard>Uh, uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear.

336
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,320
<15-9,Leonard>而我有我爱

<15-9,Leonard>再次说声对不起
<15-9,Leonard>Again, I'm sorry.

340
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,430

<15-10,Penny>其实我也有没告诉你的秘密
<15-10,Penny>Well, I have a secret I've been keeping from you, too.

342
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,340
<15-11,Leonard>是秘密银行账户吗
<15-11,Leonard>Is it a secret bank account?

343
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,370
<15-11,Leonard>因为那就太棒了
<15-11,Leonard>Because that would be awesome.

347
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,270
<15-14,Penny>为了卖药而跟医生调情  感觉特别不好
<15-14,Penny>Because I don't feel good flirting with doctors for sales.

348
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,340
<15-14,Penny>虽然我确实挣了很多钱
<15-14,Penny>I mean, I know I make a lot of money.

<15-14,Penny>但我已经不开心很长一段时间了
<15-14,Penny>But I haven't been happy for a while.

350
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,660
<15-15,Leonard>那你为什么不告诉我呢
<15-15,Leonard>Why didn't you tell me?

351
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,080
<15-16,Penny>因为我知道你有多在乎
<15-16,Penny>Because I know how important it is to you

352
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,370
<15-16,Penny>我能取得一些成绩
<15-16,Penny>that I'm having some success.

353
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,560
<15-17,Leonard>不是这样的
<15-17,Leonard>That's not true.

354
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,290
<15-18,Penny>真的吗  那么我回去当演员
<15-18,Penny>Okay, really? So you'd be fine if I went

355
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,230
<15-18,Penny>当服务员  你也不介意吗
<15-18,Penny>back to acting and waiting tables again?

356
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,380
<15-19,Leonard>如果那是你想做的事  我不介意
<15-19,Leonard>If that's what you want to do, yes.

357
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,980
<15-20,Penny>那不是我想做的事
<15-20,Penny>Well, it's not what I want to do.

358
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,660
<15-21,Leonard>太好了
<15-21,Leonard>Oh, yes.

359
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,100
<15-20,Penny>我想要什么并不重要
<15-20,Penny>Doesn't matter what I want.

360
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,050
<15-22,Penny>这份工作能让我还清卡债
<15-22,Penny>Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt.

361
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,120
<15-22,Penny>我就会做成年人该做的事  坚持到底
<15-22,Penny>So I'm gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.

362
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,040
<15-23,Leonard>那确实是成年人的行为
<15-23,Leonard>Well, that is the grown-up thing.

363
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,720
<15-24,Penny>大概吧
<15-24,Penny>I guess.

<15-25,Leonard>我爱你
