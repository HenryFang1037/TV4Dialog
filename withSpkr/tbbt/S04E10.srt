1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,620
<1-1,Sheldon>谁能给我澄清一下
<1-1,Sheldon>Clarify something for me.

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,170
<1-1,Sheldon>聚餐的精髓难道不该在于
<1-1,Sheldon>Isn't the point of a communal meal

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,670
<1-1,Sheldon>互相交换看法和主张吗
<1-1,Sheldon>the exchange of ideas and opinions?

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,910
<1-1,Sheldon>这难道不该是讨论今日大事的时刻吗
<1-1,Sheldon>An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,890
<1-1,Sheldon>是啊
<1-1,Sheldon>It is.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,220
<1-2,Leonard>但是每当你威胁要将
<1-2,Leonard>You just kind of put a damper on things

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,180
<1-2,Leonard>边吃边说的人至于死地之后
<1-2,Leonard>when you said, "The next person I see talking

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,850
<1-2,Leonard>我们就全无兴致了
<1-2,Leonard>with food in their mouth will be put to death."

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,160
<1-3,Sheldon>如果要深究谁说了什么的话  我们能纠结一整晚
<1-3,Sheldon>Well, we could argue about who said what all night long,

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,960
<1-3,Sheldon>但为了回到正轨上
<1-3,Sheldon>but to set things back on course,

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,520
<1-3,Sheldon>我要为聚餐开启个新的话题了
<1-3,Sheldon>I will propose a new topic of conversation.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,570
<1-4,Leonard>不得了了
<1-4,Leonard>Great.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,790
<1-5,Sheldon>最棒的数字是哪一个
<1-5,Sheldon>What is the best number?

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,990
<1-5,Sheldon>多说一句  答案是唯一的
<1-5,Sheldon>By the way, there's only one correct answer.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,740
<1-5,Sheldon>五百三十一万八千零八
<1-5,Sheldon>5,318,008?

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,180
<1-6,Raj>错误
<1-6,Raj>Wrong.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,540
<1-7,Sheldon>最棒的数字是73
<1-7,Sheldon>The best number is 73.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,030
<1-7,Sheldon>你们估计会疑惑原因
<1-7,Sheldon>You're probably wondering why.

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,920
<1-10,Raj>没没  我们没有
<1-10,Raj>No. Uh-uh. We're good.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,650
<1-11,Sheldon>73是第21个质数
<1-11,Sheldon>73 is the 21st prime number.

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,720
<1-11,Sheldon>而它反过来说  37是第12个质数  而它再反过来21
<1-11,Sheldon>Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21,

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,230
<1-11,Sheldon>则是构成73的两个数字
<1-11,Sheldon>is the product of multiplying--

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,830
<1-11,Sheldon>高潮来了  也就是7和3相乘的结果
<1-11,Sheldon>hang on to your hats-- seven and three.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,620
<1-11,Sheldon>怎么着  怎么着  我说错没
<1-11,Sheldon>Eh? Eh? Did I lie?

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,860
<1-12,Leonard>我们懂了
<1-12,Leonard>We get it.

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,040
<1-12,Leonard>73就是数字界的查克·诺里斯
<1-12,Leonard>73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,310
<1-13,Sheldon>那是对查克·诺里斯的褒奖
<1-13,Sheldon>Chuck Norris wishes.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,300
<1-13,Sheldon>同时73用二进制表示的结果
<1-13,Sheldon>In binary, 73 is a palindrome:

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,000
<1-13,Sheldon>是1-0-0-1-0-0-1
<1-13,Sheldon>"one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one"

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,640
<1-13,Sheldon>所以它反过来念是1-0-0-1-0-0-1
<1-13,Sheldon>which backwards is "one-zero- zero-one-zero zero one"

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,830
<1-13,Sheldon>两者是一致的
<1-13,Sheldon>exactly the same.

33
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,640
<1-13,Sheldon>而把查克·诺里斯的名字反着念是"Sirron Kcuhc"[无意义]
<1-13,Sheldon>All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc."

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,850
<1-14,Raj>我插一句
<1-14,Raj>Just for the record,

35
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,820
<1-14,Raj>如果你把5318008输进计算器后
<1-14,Raj>when you enter 5,318,008 on a calculator,

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,870
<1-14,Raj>它倒过来显示拼写的单词是"咪咪"
<1-14,Raj>upside-down it spells "boobies""

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,530
<1-15,Leonard>记得你曾疑惑过为何
<1-15,Leonard>Remember when you were wondering

38
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,150
<1-15,Leonard>女生们晚上不想跟我们一起吃吗
<1-15,Leonard>why the girls didn't want to eat with us tonight?

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,960
<1-16,Howard>是啊  我现在懂了
<1-16,Howard>Yeah, I get it now.

40
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,990
<2-1,Penny>我喜欢你的心形小吊坠  伯纳黛特
<2-1,Penny>I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,850
<2-2,Bernadette>谢谢
<2-2,Bernadette>Oh, thanks.

42
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,240
<2-2,Bernadette>是霍华德送我的
<2-2,Bernadette>Howard gave it to me.

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,450
<2-2,Bernadette>这是最好玩儿的事了
<2-2,Bernadette>It's the cutest thing.

44
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,240
<2-2,Bernadette>每当我跟他妈妈共进晚餐后
<2-2,Bernadette>Every time I have dinner with his mom,

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,480
<2-2,Bernadette>隔天总会收到他送我的首饰
<2-2,Bernadette>the next day I get jewelry.

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,980
<2-3,Amy>你们知道人们情人节送的这种心形符号
<2-3,Amy>Did you know that the iconic Valentine's heart shape

47
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,060
<2-3,Amy>其实它的原型并不是人的心脏
<2-3,Amy>is not actually based on the shape of a human heart,

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,590
<2-3,Amy>而是女性弯腰时显露的臀部形状吗
<2-3,Amy>but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,910
<2-4,Penny>也就是说我的七年级
<2-4,Penny>Oh, so I spent seventh grade

50
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,830
<2-4,Penny>一直都用的小屁股作为点缀了是吧
<2-4,Penny>dotting my I's with little asses?

51
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,020
<2-4,Penny>酷啊
<2-4,Penny>Cool.

52
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,910
<2-5,Zack>你好啊  佩妮  最近过得如何
<2-5,Zack>Hey, Penny, how's it going?

53
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,350
<2-6,Penny>你好啊  扎克  你来这做什么呢
<2-6,Penny>Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?

54
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,670
<2-7,Zack>我爸的公司为这家店印制菜单
<2-7,Zack>My dad's company prints the menus for this place.

55
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,620
<2-7,Zack>我来送些过塑了的新版本
<2-7,Zack>I'm just dropping off some new ones laminated.

56
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,240
<2-7,Zack>这样吐在上面以后容易打扫一点
<2-7,Zack>Makes 'em easier to clean if people throw up on 'em.

57
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,470
<2-7,Zack>猜猜我怎么想到的点子
<2-7,Zack>Guess how I got the idea?

58
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,440
<2-8,Penny>好了好了  我懂的
<2-8,Penny>Yeah, I got it, I got it.

59
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,060
<2-8,Penny>扎克  这是我的朋友们  伯纳黛特和艾米
<2-8,Penny>Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.

60
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,220
<2-9,Bernadette>-你好啊  -你好
<2-9,Bernadette>- Hi. - Hey.

61
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,760
<2-11,Amy>呼~
<2-11,Amy>Hoo.

62
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,080
<2-12,Zack>很高兴再见到你
<2-12,Zack>Okay, well, it was good to see you.

63
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,690
<2-13,Penny>我也是
<2-13,Penny>Yeah, you, too.

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
<2-14,Bernadette>他好帅啊  你俩怎么认识的
<2-14,Bernadette>He's really cute. How do you know him?

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,650
<2-15,Penny>我们约会过几次
<2-15,Penny>Oh, we went out a couple of times.

66
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,590
<2-16,Amy>我总被时下的表达方式所迷惑
<2-16,Amy>I'm often flummoxed by current slang.

67
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,220
<2-16,Amy>约会过是不是总代表着交媾过
<2-16,Amy>Does "went out" mean "had intercourse"?

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,340
<2-17,Bernadette>-是的  -不是  不是的
<2-17,Bernadette>- Yes. - No, no.

69
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,060
<2-18,Penny>但这次  是的
<2-18,Penny>But in this case, yes.

70
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,500
<2-19,Amy>有意思
<2-19,Amy>Interesting.

71
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,900
<2-19,Amy>是不是过程不太满意啊
<2-19,Amy>And was it not satisfactory?

72
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,840
<2-20,Penny>不  其实还不错
<2-20,Penny>No, it was great.

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,640
<2-20,Penny>只是他没有在智商层面上给我压力
<2-20,Penny>He just didn't really challenge me on an intellectual level.

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,140
<2-21,Bernadette>你不能将就一下他  然后一起去听听NPR吗
<2-21,Bernadette>Couldn't you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?

76
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,020
<2-22,Penny>没用的  扎克连NPR的全称都拼不出来
<2-22,Penny>Wouldn't help. Zack can't even spell NPR.

77
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,540
<2-23,Bernadette>我跟霍华德相处就是这么做的
<2-23,Bernadette>It's what I do with Howard.

78
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,070
<2-23,Bernadette>我比他要聪明
<2-23,Bernadette>I'm much smarter than he is.

79
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,560
<2-23,Bernadette>但保护他的男子气概是很重要的
<2-23,Bernadette>But it's important to protect his manhood.

80
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,230
<2-24,Amy>呼~
<2-24,Amy>Hoo.

81
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,210
<2-25,Bernadette>你怎么了
<2-25,Bernadette>What's the matter?

82
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,760
<2-26,Amy>我只是突感气血涌动
<2-26,Amy>I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,020
<2-26,Amy>我的心率加速  掌心冒汗
<2-26,Amy>My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy,

84
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,290
<2-26,Amy>口干舌燥
<2-26,Amy>my mouth is dry.

85
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,450
<2-26,Amy>还有  我只是不由自主地想说"呼~"
<2-26,Amy>In addition, I keep involuntarily saying "hoo."

86
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,490
<2-27,Penny>我想我们明白发生了什么  是吧
<2-27,Penny>Oh, we know what's causing that, don't we?

87
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,840
<2-28,Amy>毫无疑问
<2-28,Amy>It's no mystery.

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,970
<2-28,Amy>我明显是患有感冒
<2-28,Amy>I obviously have the flu

89
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,030
<2-28,Amy>及其突发性妥瑞综合症
<2-28,Amy>coupled with sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.

91
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,400
<2-28,Amy>生活大爆炸
<2-28,Amy>第四季第十集

92
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,960
<3-1,Howard>听说生物试验室发生的事故了吗
<3-1,Howard>Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?

93
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,080
<3-2,Leonard>-没  -发生了什么事
<3-2,Leonard>- No. - What happened?

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,810
<3-3,Howard>他们给老鼠注射了放射性同位素
<3-3,Howard>They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes

95
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,110
<3-3,Howard>但其中的一名技术员被咬了
<3-3,Howard>and one of the techs got bit.

96
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,200
<3-4,Raj>那他得到了超能力吗
<3-4,Raj>Did he get superpowers?

97
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,120
<3-5,Howard>没  他被缝了五针外加一针破伤风针剂
<3-5,Howard>No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.

98
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,600
<3-6,Raj>太令人失望了
<3-6,Raj>Oh. Well, that's disappointing.

99
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,040
<3-7,Howard>为何这么说
<3-7,Howard>Why?

100
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,500
<3-8,Raj>如果你在试验室被放射性动物咬伤
<3-8,Raj>Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab,

101
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,980
<3-8,Raj>你肯定想成为超级英雄的
<3-8,Raj>you kind of want to turn into a superhero.

102
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,590
<3-9,Howard>但谁又想变成鼠魔侠呢
<3-9,Howard>Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?

103
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,520
<3-9,Howard>谁不想啊
<3-9,Howard>Who wouldn't?

104
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,740
<3-10,Raj>你可以在迷宫里横冲直撞
<3-10,Raj>You could zip through a maze in nothing flat,

105
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,420
<3-10,Raj>钻进很小的地洞
<3-10,Raj>squeeze through really small holes,

106
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,230
<3-10,Raj>而且只要蹦跶几下就能让餐馆关门
<3-10,Raj>and shut down restaurants in a single bound.

107
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,720
<3-10,Raj>而且最棒的是  如果我是鼠魔侠
<3-10,Raj>And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man,

108
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,060
<3-10,Raj>你就可以当我的跟班  鼠娃
<3-10,Raj>you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.

109
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,800
<3-11,Howard>鼠娃
<3-11,Howard>Mouse Boy?

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,910
<3-12,Raj>你不喜欢鼠娃吗
<3-12,Raj>You don't like "Mouse Boy"?

111
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,440
<3-12,Raj>那害虫娃呢
<3-12,Raj>How about "Kid Vermin"?

112
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,470
<3-13,Howard>首先  要是我们真有超能力
<3-13,Howard>First of all, if we had superpowers,

113
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,020
<3-13,Howard>我肯定不会是跟班  你才是跟班
<3-13,Howard>I wouldn't be the sidekick. You'd be the sidekick.

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,640
<3-14,Raj>鼠魔侠才不会是跟班呢
<3-14,Raj>Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.

115
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,450
<3-15,Howard>莱纳德  你说句公道话
<3-15,Howard>Leonard, settle this.

116
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,880
<3-15,Howard>我们俩  谁更像跟班
<3-15,Howard>Of the two of us, who's the obvious sidekick?

117
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,710
<3-16,Raj>没错  莱纳德  你说是谁
<3-16,Raj>Yeah, Leonard, who?

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,200
<3-17,Leonard>高中毕业十二年了  我还是悲催地混在书呆子帮里
<3-17,Leonard>12 years after high school, and I'm still at the nerd table.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,450
<4-1,Sheldon>你是不是把这个人的脑子切得太薄了点
<4-1,Sheldon>Aren't you slicing that man's brain a little too thin?

120
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,610
<4-2,Amy>我这要是在奎兹诺餐厅
<4-2,Amy>It's too thin if I were making

121
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,490
<4-2,Amy>做英尺人脑三明治的话  就的确是切太薄了
<4-2,Amy>a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos.

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,420
<4-2,Amy>但是放在双光子显微镜下检验的话  就不算薄
<4-2,Amy>For examination under a two-photon microscope, it's fine.

123
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,620
<4-3,Sheldon>好吧  你是专家
<4-3,Sheldon>Well, you're the expert.

124
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,760
<4-3,Sheldon>如果胡来才是正确的方法的话  那我闭嘴
<4-3,Sheldon>If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.

125
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,520
<4-4,Amy>很好
<4-4,Amy>Very well.

126
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,230
<4-4,Amy>如果你死后将遗体捐献给科学研究的话
<4-4,Amy>If you die and donate your body to science,

127
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,510
<4-4,Amy>我保证我会把你的大脑切得跟加拿大培根一样厚
<4-4,Amy>I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.

128

<4-5,Sheldon>谢谢
<4-5,Sheldon>Thank you.

129
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,350
<4-6,Amy>如果你不介意的话
<4-6,Amy>Now, if you'll excuse me,

130
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,310
<4-6,Amy>我要量一下我的体温
<4-6,Amy>I have to take my temperature.

131
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,930
<4-7,Sheldon>你是在监控你的生理节奏
<4-7,Sheldon>Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms

132
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,330
<4-7,Sheldon>以确定你脑部活动最旺盛的时段吗
<4-7,Sheldon>in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity?

133
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,630
<4-7,Sheldon>我曾经在某个暑假试过
<4-7,Sheldon>I did that one summer.

134
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,590
<4-7,Sheldon>美好的童年啊
<4-7,Sheldon>Ah, youth.

135
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,500
<4-8,Amy>不是  我昨晚产生了一些奇怪的症状
<4-8,Amy>No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night,

136
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,260
<4-8,Amy>所以我每个小时都在检查自己的生命迹象
<4-8,Amy>so I'm checking my vital signs every hour.

137
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,110
<4-9,Sheldon>我很乐意帮你做个图表
<4-9,Sheldon>I'd be happy to create a chart

138
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,390
<4-9,Sheldon>进行一下差异分析
<4-9,Sheldon>and participate in a differential diagnosis.

139
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,470
<4-10,Amy>好像挺好玩的嘛
<4-10,Amy>Oh, that sounds like fun.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,990
<4-10,Amy>开始吧
<4-10,Amy>All right.

141
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,270
<4-11,Sheldon>你有哪些症状
<4-11,Sheldon>What were the symptoms?

142
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,950
<4-12,Amy>心跳加速  手心出汗  口干舌燥
<4-12,Amy>Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth

143
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,710
<4-12,Amy>还有局部的血管抽动
<4-12,Amy>and localized vascular throbbing.

144
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,680
<4-13,Sheldon>局部是哪
<4-13,Sheldon>Localized to what region?

145
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,920
<4-14,Amy>耳朵和生殖器
<4-14,Amy>Ears and genitalia.

146
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,410
<4-14,Amy>有意思
<4-14,Amy>Interesting.

147
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,240
<4-15,Sheldon>是两个通常不会放一起说的器官
<4-15,Sheldon>Not body parts that usually team up.

148
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,040
<4-15,Sheldon>那环境因素呢
<4-15,Sheldon>What about environmental factors?

149
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,100
<4-15,Sheldon>形容一下当时的情景
<4-15,Sheldon>Describe the scene for me.

150
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,170
<4-16,Amy>我跟佩妮还有伯纳黛特一起在餐馆
<4-16,Amy>I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette,

151
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,670
<4-16,Amy>喝水  而且喝的是碳酸水  因为那是特殊场合
<4-16,Amy>drinking water -- carbonated as it was a special occasion.

152
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,310
<4-16,Amy>佩妮的朋友扎克过来打了个招呼
<4-16,Amy>Penny's friend Zack stopped by and said hello

153
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,380
<4-16,Amy>然后我就说"呼"[和"谁"同音]
<4-16,Amy>and I said "hoo."

154
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,170
<4-17,Sheldon>谁
<4-17,Sheldon>Who?

155
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,860
<4-18,Amy>扎克
<4-18,Amy>Zack.

156
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,710
<4-19,Sheldon>你知道是扎克还问
<4-19,Sheldon>Then why did you ask?

157
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,610
<4-20,Amy>-问什么  -问"谁"呀
<4-20,Amy>- Ask what?  - Who.

158
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,240
<4-22,Amy>扎克
<4-22,Amy>Zack.

159
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,100
<4-23,Sheldon>好吧  重头来一遍
<4-23,Sheldon>All right, let's start over.

160
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,700
<4-23,Sheldon>扎克走过来后你说了什么
<4-23,Sheldon>What did you say when Zack walked in?

161
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,670
<4-25,Sheldon>-"呼"["谁"]  -扎克
<4-25,Sheldon>- "Hoo".  - Zack.

162
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,930
<4-26,Amy>你为什么一直说"扎克"
<4-26,Amy>Why do you keep saying "Zack"?

163
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,640
<4-27,Sheldon>因为你一直问"谁"["呼"]呀
<4-27,Sheldon>Because you keep saying "who."

164
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,860
<4-28,Amy>我现在可没说"呼"
<4-28,Amy>I'm not saying "hoo" now.

165
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,380
<4-28,Amy>我是昨晚说的"呼"
<4-28,Amy>I said "hoo" last night.

166
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,180
<4-29,Sheldon>答案就是扎克  对吧
<4-29,Sheldon>And the answer was Zack, correct?

167
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,270
<4-30,Amy>我没问问题啊
<4-30,Amy>There was no question.

168
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,280
<4-30,Amy>我只是说了"呼"
<4-30,Amy>I simply said "hoo."

169
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,550
<4-31,Sheldon>好吧  我不纠结了
<4-31,Sheldon>All right, I think I have enough to go on.

170
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,680
<4-31,Sheldon>你以上症状的诱因
<4-31,Sheldon>Possible explanations for your symptoms are,

171
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,690
<4-31,Sheldon>根据可能性降序排列的结果如下
<4-31,Sheldon>in descending order of likelihood:

172
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,830
<4-31,Sheldon>甲亢  过早绝经
<4-31,Sheldon>hyperthyroidism, premature menopause,

173
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,060
<4-32,Amy>外星人附体  或是
<4-32,Amy>hosting an alien parasite or --

174
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,900
<4-31,Sheldon>以下这个结果纯粹是为了涵盖所有
<4-31,Sheldon>and I only include it for the sake of covering

175
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,640
<4-31,Sheldon>可能因素  那就是性冲动
<4-31,Sheldon>absolutely all bases -- sexual arousal.

176
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,210
<4-32,Amy>我在哪儿被外星人附的身啊
<4-32,Amy>Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?

177
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,760
<5-1,Howard>找到你了
<5-1,Howard>There you are.

178
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,960
<5-3,Howard>问你个问题  你最怕什么
<5-3,Howard>Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?

179
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,180
<5-4,Raj>我也不知道
<5-4,Raj>I don't know. Um...

180
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,260
<5-4,Raj>核战
<5-4,Raj>nuclear war.

181
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,020
<5-4,Raj>不小心被活埋了
<5-4,Raj>Accidentally being buried alive.

182
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,640
<5-4,Raj>或者是像那种电影情节一样  突然接到一个电话
<5-4,Raj>Any of those movies where you get that phone call

183
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,150
<5-4,Raj>电话那头的人说你就要死了
<5-4,Raj>that says you're going to die.

184
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,080
<5-4,Raj>结果你还就真挂了
<5-4,Raj>And then you do.

185
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,920
<5-5,Howard>不是这些  是某个
<5-5,Howard>No. Something very specific

186
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,170
<5-5,Howard>咱俩都知道你
<5-5,Howard>that we both know you,

187
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,560
<5-5,Howard>也就是拉杰·库萨帕里  害怕的东西
<5-5,Howard>Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.

188
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,100
<5-6,Raj>我家的确有二型糖尿病史
<5-6,Raj>Well, type two diabetes runs in my family.

189
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,960
<5-6,Raj>糖尿病后期会掉脚趾的
<5-6,Raj>The thought of losing a toe...

190
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,610
<5-7,Howard>是蜘蛛  你怕蜘蛛
<5-7,Howard>Spiders! You're afraid of spiders!

191
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,680
<5-8,Raj>这是什么
<5-8,Raj>What the heck is this?

192
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,260
<5-9,Howard>当然是装着一只大蜘蛛的罐子啦
<5-9,Howard>A jar with a big spider in it, of course.

193
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,970
<5-9,Howard>勇敢度测试
<5-9,Howard>Bravery test.

194
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,960
<5-9,Howard>先把手拿出来的人就是跟班
<5-9,Howard>First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.

195
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,800
<5-10,Raj>你疯了吗
<5-10,Raj>Are you crazy?

196
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,650
<5-11,Howard>也许吧
<5-11,Howard>Perhaps.

197
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,000
<5-11,Howard>你怕了吗
<5-11,Howard>Are you scared?

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,820
<5-12,Raj>没有  但这测试很白痴
<5-12,Raj>No. But it's a stupid test.

199
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,020
<5-13,Howard>是吗  要是地球危在旦夕
<5-13,Howard>Oh, really? What if the Earth was in danger

200
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,130
<5-13,Howard>而唯一拯救的方法就是
<5-13,Howard>and the only way to save it was

201
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,350
<5-13,Howard>把你的手伸进装着蜘蛛的罐子里呢
<5-13,Howard>to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?

202
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,540
<5-14,Raj>是吗  要是地球危在旦夕
<5-14,Raj>Oh, yeah? What if the Earth was in danger

203
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,250
<5-14,Raj>而唯一的拯救办法就是
<5-14,Raj>and the only way to save it was to take a shower

204
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,280
<5-14,Raj>在更衣室里洗澡  还被人看到你的裸体
<5-14,Raj>in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?

205
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,470
<5-15,Howard>得了  这事没可能发生
<5-15,Howard>Oh, come on. That's never gonna happen.

206
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,770
<5-15,Howard>快把手放进罐子里
<5-15,Howard>Put your hand in the jar

207
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,090
<5-15,Howard>不然你就一辈子做我跟班吧
<5-15,Howard>or forever be revealed as my sidekick.

208
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,030
<5-16,Raj>好吧  这就放
<5-16,Raj>All right, I will.

209
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,570
<5-17,Howard>你怎么一下子胆儿这么肥了
<5-17,Howard>How did you get so brave all of a sudden?

210
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,860
<5-18,Raj>简单
<5-18,Raj>It's easy.

211
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,480
<5-18,Raj>蜘蛛都爬到你手臂上了
<5-18,Raj>The spider's crawling up your arm.

212
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,130
<5-19,Howard>快把这货弄下来
<5-19,Howard>Get it off! Get it off!

213
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,780
<5-19,Howard>快点  拉杰
<5-19,Howard>Please, Raj!

214
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,000
<5-19,Howard>别愣着
<5-19,Howard>Please.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,090
<6-1,Amy>我的血检表明甲状腺功能正常
<6-1,Amy>My blood work shows thyroid function normal.

216
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,850
<6-1,Amy>皮质醇水平也正常
<6-1,Amy>Cortisol levels normal.

217
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,380
<6-2,Sheldon>那你的垂体卵泡刺激素水平呢
<6-2,Sheldon>How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?

218
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,800
<6-3,Amy>谢尔顿  我还没到更年期
<6-3,Amy>Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.

219
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,630
<6-3,Amy>你确定吗
<6-3,Amy>Are you sure?

220
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,960
<6-4,Sheldon>你这口气听着像个暴躁的欧巴桑
<6-4,Sheldon>You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.

221
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,210
<6-5,Amy>我觉得我们得面对一个残酷的现实
<6-5,Amy>I think we need to face the cold, hard truth:

222
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,540
<6-5,Amy>我被佩妮的朋友扎克性唤起了
<6-5,Amy>I was sexually aroused by Penny's friend Zack.

223
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,040
<6-6,Sheldon>慢着  我觉得
<6-6,Sheldon>Hang on. I don't know

224
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,390
<6-6,Sheldon>我们还没考虑过外星人附体的可能性呢
<6-6,Sheldon>that we've given the alien parasite hypothesis

225
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,200
<6-6,Sheldon>这个合理假设
<6-6,Sheldon>a fair shake.

226
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,790
<6-7,Amy>我们还是有点逻辑吧
<6-7,Amy>Let's look at this logically.

227
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,820
<6-7,Amy>我有胃  所以会饿
<6-7,Amy>I have a stomach; I get hungry.

228
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,680
<6-7,Amy>我有生殖器  所以也可能会有性冲动
<6-7,Amy>I have genitals; I have the potential for sexual arousal.

229
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,150
<6-8,Sheldon>这是我们必须承受的负担
<6-8,Sheldon>A cross we all must bear.

230
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,040
<6-8,Sheldon>每次我遭遇这种艰难时刻
<6-8,Sheldon>You know, in difficult moments like this,

231
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,070
<6-8,Sheldon>我总是借助更强大的力量约束自己
<6-8,Sheldon>I often turn to a force greater than myself.

232
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,840
<6-9,Amy>宗教信仰吗
<6-9,Amy>Religion?

233
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,370
<6-10,Sheldon>《星际迷航》
<6-10,Sheldon>Star Trek.

234
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,450
<6-10,Sheldon>你看过《星舰迷航记I》吗
<6-10,Sheldon>Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?

235
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,130
<6-12,Sheldon>-没有  -别看了  烂得要死  但是...
<6-12,Sheldon>- No. Don't. - It's terrible. However...

236
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,670
<6-12,Sheldon>在这部电影里我们知道
<6-12,Sheldon>in it, we learn that

237
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,850
<6-12,Sheldon>当史波克发现自己丧失了理性逻辑
<6-12,Sheldon>when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic

238
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,780
<6-12,Sheldon>而被他人类那部分的情绪所影响
<6-12,Sheldon>by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them

239
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,990
<6-12,Sheldon>他就用瓦肯族科里纳心律原则压抑自己
<6-12,Sheldon>using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinahr.

240
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,530
<6-13,Amy>你的意思是  我们的人生要受
<6-13,Amy>Are you suggesting we live our lives

241
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,200
<6-13,Amy>不入流的科幻作品里的思想的影响吗
<6-13,Amy>guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?

242
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,530
<6-14,Sheldon>不入流的科幻作品
<6-14,Sheldon>"Cheap science fiction"?

243
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,880
<6-15,Amy>你在做什么
<6-15,Amy>What are you doing?

244
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,600
<6-16,Sheldon>用科里纳规则来压抑我因为上个评论所产生的愤怒
<6-16,Sheldon>Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.

245
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,630
<6-17,Amy>你现在对我这么在意
<6-17,Amy>Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment

246
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,050
<6-17,Amy>会不会就是因为嫉妒作祟
<6-17,Amy>is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?

247
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,080
<6-18,Sheldon>这我倒没想过
<6-18,Sheldon>I hadn't considered that.

248
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,240
<6-18,Sheldon>稍等片刻
<6-18,Sheldon>Give me a moment.

249
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,870
<6-18,Sheldon>好了  我想过了
<6-18,Sheldon>All right, I've considered it.

250
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,370
<6-20,Sheldon>-然后呢  -驳回这一说法
<6-20,Sheldon>- And? - I reject it.

251
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,200
<6-21,Amy>是因为你没感觉到嫉妒
<6-21,Amy>You reject it because you don't feel jealousy,

252
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,810
<6-21,Amy>还是因为你压抑掉了
<6-21,Amy>or because you are suppressing jealousy?

253
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,520
<6-22,Sheldon>我想我还是回家吃午餐吧
<6-22,Sheldon>I think I'll eat my lunch at home.

254
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,700
<6-23,Amy>那不是你的午餐  谢尔顿
<6-23,Amy>That's not your lunch, Sheldon;

255
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,080
<6-23,Amy>那些是尸体的大脑标本
<6-23,Amy>those are the cadaver brain specimens.

256
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,250
<6-24,Sheldon>就因为你切片切得不对
<6-24,Sheldon>As they were incorrectly sliced,

257
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,720
<6-24,Sheldon>害得我都把它们当成生鱼片了
<6-24,Sheldon>you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.

258
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,270
<7-1,Sheldon>-你好  -好啊
<7-1,Sheldon>- Hello. - Hey.

259
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,660
<7-2,Penny>你不是都明天洗衣服的吗
<7-2,Penny>Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?

260
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,970
<7-3,Sheldon>我常用的柔软剂超市卖光了
<7-3,Sheldon>The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener.

261
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,410
<7-3,Sheldon>如果这一款过柔或不够柔
<7-3,Sheldon>If this one under-or over-softens,

262
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,740
<7-3,Sheldon>我得花时间处理
<7-3,Sheldon>I'll need time to make things right.

263
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,170
<7-4,Penny>真会未雨绸缪
<7-4,Penny>That's thinking ahead.

264
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,360
<7-5,Sheldon>换句话说是怎么早没想到
<7-5,Sheldon>The alternative would be to think backwards.

265
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
<7-5,Sheldon>这下记住了
<7-5,Sheldon>That's just remembering.

266
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,280
<7-6,Penny>艾米怎么样了
<7-6,Penny>So how's Amy?

267
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,470
<7-7,Sheldon>艾米变了
<7-7,Sheldon>Amy's changed.

268
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,700
<7-7,Sheldon>也许我该放手了
<7-7,Sheldon>I might have to let her go.

269
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,600
<7-8,Penny>哦不  为什么啊
<7-8,Penny>Oh, no. Why?

270
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,100
<7-9,Sheldon>我以为她是个高度进化的
<7-9,Sheldon>I thought she was a highly evolved creature

271
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,560
<7-9,Sheldon>纯高智商物种  就像我
<7-9,Sheldon>of pure intellect, like me.

272
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,920
<7-9,Sheldon>而最近的事件表明
<7-9,Sheldon>But recent events indicate that

273
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,960
<7-9,Sheldon>她也许不过是个屈服于低级欲望的生物
<7-9,Sheldon>she may be a slave to her baser urges.

274
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,000
<7-9,Sheldon>就像你
<7-9,Sheldon>Like you.

275
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,320
<7-10,Penny>这句侮辱我就当没听到吧
<7-10,Penny>Just going to skip over that insult.

276
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,180
<7-11,Sheldon>什么侮辱
<7-11,Sheldon>What insult?

277
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,340
<7-12,Penny>没错  所以我才要假装没听到
<7-12,Penny>Yeah! That's why I'm going to skip over it.

278
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,090
<7-12,Penny>你是说艾米她...
<7-12,Penny>Are you saying that Amy is...

279
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,280
<7-12,Penny>用科学的话怎么说来着...
<7-12,Penny>oh, what's the scientific word...

280
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,610
<7-13,Sheldon>别提科学了  她就是很饥渴
<7-13,Sheldon>Forget science. She's horny.

281
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,550
<7-14,Penny>好吧  哎呀
<7-14,Penny>Oh! Okay. Wow.

282
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,700
<7-15,Sheldon>完全是生理上的需求  我无能为力
<7-15,Sheldon>It's simple biology. There's nothing I can do about it.

283
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,630
<7-16,Penny>你确定吗
<7-16,Penny>Are you sure?

284
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,560
<7-17,Sheldon>你这是什么意思
<7-17,Sheldon>What are you suggesting?

285
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,340
<7-18,Penny>我的意思是  也许你可以对
<7-18,Penny>I'm suggesting there might be something

286
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,980
<7-18,Penny>艾米的欲望  做点什么
<7-18,Penny>you could do about... Amy's urges?

287
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,950
<7-19,Sheldon>切除人的卵巢是犯法的
<7-19,Sheldon>It's illegal to spay a human being.

288
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,670
<7-20,Penny>好吧  我不是这意思
<7-20,Penny>Yeah. That's not what I had in mind.

289
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,780
<7-21,Sheldon>你是说我自己可以做什么
<7-21,Sheldon>You mean... something I could do.

290
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,300
<7-22,Penny>一点没错
<7-22,Penny>Exactly.

291
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,770
<7-23,Sheldon>好吧  我一直想避免这么做
<7-23,Sheldon>Well, I was hoping to avoid this.

292
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,680
<7-23,Sheldon>但我想还是勉为其难一下吧
<7-23,Sheldon>But I might as well get it over with.

293
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,450
<7-23,Sheldon>谢谢  佩妮
<7-23,Sheldon>Thank you, Penny.

294
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,000
<7-23,Sheldon>我会告知你结果的
<7-23,Sheldon>I'll let you know what happens.

295
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,630
<7-24,Penny>哎呀  艾米  你真是个幸运儿
<7-24,Penny>Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

<8-1,Sheldon>你好  我是谢尔顿·库珀博士

<8-1,Sheldon>Is this the Zack Johnson

298
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,780
<8-1,Sheldon>和我邻居佩妮交媾的那个
<8-1,Sheldon>who used to have coitus with my neighbor Penny?

299

<8-1,Sheldon>抱歉打扰了
<8-1,Sheldon>Sorry to bother you.

<8-1,Sheldon>你好  我想找扎克·强生
<8-1,Sheldon>Hello. I'm looking for a Zack Johnson

301
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,500
<8-1,Sheldon>曾和我邻居佩妮交媾的那位
<8-1,Sheldon>who used to have coitus with my neighbor Penny.

302
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,000
<8-1,Sheldon>交媾  就是性交
<8-1,Sheldon>Coitus. It means intercourse.

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,820
<8-1,Sheldon>我有预感你就是我要找的那位扎克
<8-1,Sheldon>And I have a feeling I'm speaking to the right Zack.

306
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,420
<8-1,Sheldon>对  确实很像女孩名
<8-1,Sheldon>Yes, that does sound like a girl's name.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,590
<8-1,Sheldon>不  我不觉得困扰
<8-1,Sheldon>No, it doesn't bother me.

308
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,830
<8-1,Sheldon>对  叫我"臭谢利"我确实很困扰
<8-1,Sheldon>Yes, "Smelly Shelly" does bother me.

309
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,370
<8-1,Sheldon>我告诉你我为啥打给你
<8-1,Sheldon>Let me tell you why I'm calling.

310
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,310
<8-1,Sheldon>我想知道你是否有兴趣
<8-1,Sheldon>I'd like to know if you'd be interested

311
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,540
<8-1,Sheldon>跟艾米·菲拉·福勒性交
<8-1,Sheldon>in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler.

312
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,980
<8-1,Sheldon>艾米·菲拉·福勒
<8-1,Sheldon>Amy Farrah Fowler.

313
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,730
<8-1,Sheldon>没错  这确实是个女孩
<8-1,Sheldon>Yes, that is a girl's name.

314
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,510
<8-1,Sheldon>天哪  简直就是对牛弹琴
<8-1,Sheldon>Good grief. It's like trying to talk to a dolphin.

315
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,700
<8-1,Sheldon>坑爹呐
<8-1,Sheldon>Really?

316
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,910
<9-1,Leonard>这样来决定谁是英雄  谁是跟班
<9-1,Leonard>This is going to decide who's the hero and who's the sidekick?

317
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,580
<9-2,Howard>你有更好的主意
<9-2,Howard>You got a better idea?

318
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,930
<9-3,Leonard>随便哪个主意都比这好
<9-3,Leonard>Every idea is better than this idea.

319
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,050
<9-4,Howard>叮
<9-4,Howard>Ding!

320
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,590
<9-5,Raj>-等等  叮什么叮  -这是铃声
<9-5,Raj>- Wait. What the hell is "ding"?  - It's a bell.

321
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,020
<9-7,Raj>我可不觉得摔跤比赛是用铃的
<9-7,Raj>I don't think this kind of wrestling has a bell.

322
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
<9-8,Howard>好吧  你说怎么着
<9-8,Howard>Fine. How do you want to start?

323
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,690
<9-9,Raj>不然我们喊一二三开始
<9-9,Raj>I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?

324
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,920
<9-10,Howard>一二三开始  那是小孩子用的
<9-10,Howard>One-two-three-go? That's for babies.

325
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,110
<9-11,Raj>好吧  不然这样...
<9-11,Raj>Okay, how about, uh...

326
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,530
<9-11,Raj>各就各位  预备  开始
<9-11,Raj>on your mark, get set, go?

327
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,220
<9-12,Howard>那是赛跑用的  你想跑吗
<9-12,Howard>That's for a footrace. If you want to race,

328
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,150
<9-12,Howard>那还得出去跑
<9-12,Howard>we have to go outside.

329
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,860
<9-13,Raj>不  外面太冷了  我没穿外套
<9-13,Raj>No, it's chilly outside. Didn't bring my jacket.

330
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,950
<9-14,Howard>搞什么名堂
<9-14,Howard>Oh, for crying out loud.

331
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,120
<9-14,Howard>哪门子超级英雄还需要外套啊
<9-14,Howard>What kind of superhero needs a jacket?

332
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,860
<9-15,Raj>那你告诉我哪门子英雄会说  "那件红色紧身衣是我的"
<9-15,Raj>What kind of superhero says, "Dibs on the red tights!

333
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,500
<9-15,Raj>"那件红色紧身衣是我的"
<9-15,Raj>Dibs on the red tights!"

334
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,010
<9-16,Howard>那这样吧  预备  摔跤
<9-16,Howard>All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.

335
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,930
<9-17,Raj>等等  现在就开始吗  还是等真的开始时
<9-17,Raj>Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you're going to say

336
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,780
<9-17,Raj>-再说这句话  -现在就开始
<9-17,Raj>- when we do start, or...  - We're starting now!

337
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,450
<9-19,Raj>别冲我嚷嚷
<9-19,Raj>Don't yell at me!

338
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,620
<9-20,Leonard>假设还有比这更糟糕的方法耗过周五的夜晚
<9-20,Leonard>Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night.

339
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,760
<9-20,Leonard>完全想不到啊
<9-20,Leonard>None come to mind.

340
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,740
<10-1,Sheldon>看看他们盖的这戳  谁允许他们
<10-1,Sheldon>Look at this stamp. On what authority

341
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,460
<10-1,Sheldon>在顾客进门时往他们手上盖印子的
<10-1,Sheldon>are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?

342
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,900
<10-2,Amy>肯定洗得掉的
<10-2,Amy>I'm sure it'll wash off.

343
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,340
<10-3,Sheldon>今晚总算还有点安慰
<10-3,Sheldon>Little comfort tonight.

344
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,320
<10-3,Sheldon>我看着像地狱天使
<10-3,Sheldon>I look like a Hell's Angel.

345
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,430
<10-4,Amy>扎克在那
<10-4,Amy>There's Zack.

346
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,490
<10-5,Sheldon>你确定真的想这么做吗
<10-5,Sheldon>Are you sure this is what you want to do?

347
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,510
<10-6,Amy>不是我想做
<10-6,Amy>It's not what I want to do;

348
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,780
<10-6,Amy>而是不得不做
<10-6,Amy>it's what I have to do.

349
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,870
<10-7,Sheldon>去吧  艾米·菲拉·福勒
<10-7,Sheldon>Go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

350
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,870
<10-7,Sheldon>遵循自己内分泌系统的呼唤
<10-7,Sheldon>Follow your endocrine system.

351
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,150
<10-8,Amy>谢谢  谢尔顿  你真是好朋友
<10-8,Amy>Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.

352
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,130
<10-9,Sheldon>区区小忙不足挂齿
<10-9,Sheldon>Please don't drag this out.

353
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,450
<10-9,Sheldon>这玩意肯定洗不掉
<10-9,Sheldon>This is never going to come off.

354
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,720
<10-9,Sheldon>打扰一下
<10-9,Sheldon>Excuse me?

355
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,480
<10-10,Amy>扎克  我是艾米·菲拉·福勒  那晚见过的
<10-10,Amy>Zack, I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night.

356
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,040
<10-10,Amy>我一直在追求着纯粹的知识
<10-10,Amy>I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge.

357
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,320
<10-10,Amy>直到遇到了你  才合理理性地决定
<10-10,Amy>Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason

358
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,930
<10-10,Amy>站在你面前的  是130磅沸腾的雌性激素
<10-10,Amy>And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen,

359
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,230
<10-10,Amy>渴望着抱住你的臀大肌
<10-10,Amy>longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus

360
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,720
<10-10,Amy>来一场莎士比亚所比喻的
<10-10,Amy>and make Shakespeare's metaphorical

361
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
<10-10,Amy>禽兽一样的勾当
<10-10,Amy>beast with two backs.

362
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,120
<10-11,Zack>我的臀什么
<10-11,Zack>My gluteus what?

363
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,070
<10-12,Amy>另一方面
<10-12,Amy>On the other hand,

364
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,280
<10-12,Amy>看到你这一片空白傻瓜似的表情
<10-12,Amy>as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face,

366
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,620
<10-12,Amy>我又决定去培养瓦肯人"柯里纳"的习惯
<10-12,Amy>I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar.

367
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,120
<10-12,Amy>-再见  扎克  -再见
<10-12,Amy>- Good-bye, Zack. - Bye.

368
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,830
<10-12,Amy>呼~~
<10-12,Amy>Hoo.

369
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,420
<10-13,Zack>这样够我支撑一会了
<10-13,Zack>That should hold me for a while.

370
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,160
<11-1,Howard>法律上我有义务提醒你
<11-1,Howard>I'm legally obligated to inform you

371
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,110
<11-1,Howard>我11岁时上过空手道课程
<11-1,Howard>that I took a karate lesson when I was 11.

372
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,640
<11-1,Howard>要是我妈安排好搭车的事
<11-1,Howard>I'd be a regular ninja by now

373
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,350
<11-1,Howard>我现在早就是一合格的忍者了
<11-1,Howard>if my mom could've arranged a carpool.

374
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
<11-3,Howard>是吗
<11-3,Howard>Oh, yeah?

375
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
<11-2,Raj>我在健身中心上过普拉提课程
<11-2,Raj>Well, I've been taking Pilates class at the rec center,

376
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,410
<11-2,Raj>我的腹肌就跟哈希巧克力块儿一样
<11-2,Raj>and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.

377
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,050
<11-3,Howard>是吗  没关系  反正你输定了
<11-3,Howard>Oh, yeah? Won't matter, you're going down!

378
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,740
<11-4,Raj>不  你才输定了
<11-4,Raj>No, uh-uh, you're going down!

379
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,280
<11-5,Howard>有人输的话  肯定是你
<11-5,Howard>If anybody's going to go down, it's going to be you.

380
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,540
<11-6,Leonard>伙计们  都30分钟了  你们还没碰过对方
<11-6,Leonard>Fellas. It's been 30 minutes. Nobody's touched each other.

381
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,010
<11-6,Leonard>很高兴你决定驳回你的动物本能
<11-6,Leonard>I'm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain

382
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,520
<12-1,Sheldon>回到纯粹智力的领域
<12-1,Sheldon>and return to the realm of pure intellect.

383
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,930
<12-2,Amy>我也是
<12-2,Amy>As am I.

384
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,280
<12-3,Sheldon>你这是干嘛
<12-3,Sheldon>What are you doing?

385
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,260
<12-4,Amy>做个实验
<12-4,Amy>An experiment.

386
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,660
<12-4,Amy>没  没什么  算了
<12-4,Amy>Nope. Nothing. Never mind.

387
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,820
<13-1,Raj>你知道你赢不了的吧
<13-1,Raj>You realize you can't win.

388
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,960
<13-2,Howard>我宁愿相信  我输不了
<13-2,Howard>I prefer to think that I can't lose.

389
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,620
<13-2,Howard>你错了
<13-2,Howard>You're wrong.

390
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,710
<13-3,Raj>那只是时间问题
<13-3,Raj>It's only a matter of time

391
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,220
<13-3,Raj>你迟早会落入鼠魔侠的捕鼠器的
<13-3,Raj>before you fall into Rat-Man's rat trap.

392
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,240
<13-4,Howard>你个可悲的笨蛋
<13-4,Howard>You pathetic fool!

393
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,970
<13-4,Howard>有捕鼠器的话  难道不会抓到鼠魔侠么
<13-4,Howard>If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?

394
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,730
<13-5,Raj>我没表达好
<13-5,Raj>Just because I didn't express myself well

395
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,000
<13-5,Raj>不代表我的观点也不对
<13-5,Raj>doesn't mean my underlying point was invalid!

396
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,300
<13-5,Raj>你个喋喋不休的小丑
<13-5,Raj>You bloviating buffoon!

397
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,330
<13-6,Howard>你个自恋的脑残
<13-6,Howard>You narcissistic nincompoop!

398
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,250
<13-7,Raj>你个红鬼懦夫
<13-7,Raj>You crimson coward!

399
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,160
<13-7,Raj>莱纳德  醒醒
<13-7,Raj>Oh, Leonard, wake up,

400
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,270
<13-7,Raj>你错过了不少超级英雄的精彩名言了
<13-7,Raj>you're missing some very excellent superhero quips.
