00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,280
<1-3,Howard>只是被困在这...
<1-3,Howard>It's just, being cooped up in this...

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,880
<1-3,Howard>"锡盒"里有段时日  快受不了
<1-3,Howard>tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.

<1-4,Bernadette>-就能回家了  -我知道
<1-4,Bernadette>- and then you'll be home. - I know.

8

00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,290
<1-7,Howard>你走之前可以帮我做件事吗
<1-7,Howard>Before you go, can you do something for me?

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,090
<1-8,Bernadette>你想我做什么呢
<1-8,Bernadette>What do you want me to do?

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,090
<1-9,Howard>是这样的
<1-9,Howard>Okay, here it is.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,530
<1-9,Howard>我好想念地心引力
<1-9,Howard>I really miss gravity.

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,680
<1-9,Howard>你可以让我看看东西垂直落下的样子吗
<1-9,Howard>Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,460
<1-10,Bernadette>真的吗  你真想看啊
<1-10,Bernadette>Really, you're serious?

17
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,790
<1-10,Bernadette>好吧
<1-10,Bernadette>Okay.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,480
<1-11,Howard>哎哟  宝贝  我要爽死了
<1-11,Howard>Oh, baby, you're killing me.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,020
<2-1,Penny>谢尔顿
<2-1,Penny>Hey, Sheldon?

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,150
<2-1,Penny>今天来了一个你的包裹  你妈寄的
<2-1,Penny>This came for you today. It's from your mom.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,910
<2-2,Sheldon>谢谢你  佩妮
<2-2,Sheldon>Thank you, Penny.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,930
<2-4,Sheldon>稍等...  给
<2-4,Sheldon>Yeah, wait... here.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,170
<2-4,Sheldon>你的辛苦费
<2-4,Sheldon>For your troubles.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,320
<2-5,Penny>妈呀  整整一元大洋呢
<2-5,Penny>Oh, boy, a whole dollar.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,760
<2-5,Penny>我可以不用去送报了
<2-5,Penny>Now, I can quit my paper route.

26
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,700
<2-5,Penny>-里面是什么啊  -根本无所谓
<2-5,Penny>- So, what's in it? - Mmm, doesn't matter.

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,020
<2-6,Leonard>通常他都是隔着盒子玩[模型玩具]而已
<2-6,Leonard>Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,510
<2-7,Sheldon>是我小时候写的日志与研究报告啦
<2-7,Sheldon>Yeah, it's journals and research papers I wrote as a child.

29
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,940
<2-8,Penny>真有爱
<2-8,Penny>Aw, how cute.

30
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,270
<2-8,Penny>这就跟日记一样吗
<2-8,Penny>Is this like a diary?

31
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,100
<2-9,Sheldon>不是  那是我的如厕训练日志
<2-9,Sheldon>No, that's my potty training journal.

32
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,370
<2-10,Penny>-不是吧  你的如厕训练日志啊  -是的
<2-10,Penny>- Really, your potty training journal? - Yeah.

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,200
<2-11,Sheldon>字迹难看  多多包涵
<2-11,Sheldon>And forgive my crude penmanship.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,950
<2-11,Sheldon>我六岁之后才开始打字
<2-11,Sheldon>I didn't start typing until I was six.

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,200
<2-12,Penny>"8月7号  上午8点42分
<2-12,Penny>"August 7, 8:42 A.M.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,010
<2-12,Penny>这真是太丢人了  这尿布是怎么回事"
<2-12,Penny>This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?"

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,990
<2-13,Sheldon>后面还有图表
<2-13,Sheldon>There are some charts in the back

38
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,830
<2-13,Sheldon>记录我的屎形  屎色与软硬度
<2-13,Sheldon>where I kept track of shape, color and consistency.

39
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,240
<2-14,Penny>真恶心
<2-14,Penny>Disgusting.

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,570
<2-15,Leonard>真正恶心的是他到现在都还会做记录
<2-15,Leonard>No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track.

41
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,110
<2-16,Penny>-你为什么要这些玩意啊  -别别别
<2-16,Penny>- Why do you need all this stuff...? - No, no, no, no...

42
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,500
<2-18,Penny>-抱歉  -问得好
<2-18,Penny>- Sorry! - I am glad you asked.

43
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,900
<2-19,Sheldon>你知道希格斯玻色子吗
<2-19,Sheldon>Yeah, are you familiar with the Higgs boson?

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,430
<2-20,Penny>当然知道啊  新闻上都有
<2-20,Penny>Of course, it is... it's been in the news.

46
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,050
<2-20,Penny>超出名的玻色子
<2-20,Penny>And it's a very famous boson.

47
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,360
<2-21,Sheldon>你少来了
<2-21,Sheldon>Nice try.

48
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
<2-21,Sheldon>在1964年时  彼得·希格斯博士
<2-21,Sheldon>Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs,

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,600
<2-21,Sheldon>一个成功自信的物理学家
<2-21,Sheldon>accomplished self-promoter and physicist,

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,130
<2-21,Sheldon>写了文章假定一种亚原子粒子
<2-21,Sheldon>he wrote a paper postulating the existence

51
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,840
<2-21,Sheldon>"希格斯玻色子"的存在
<2-21,Sheldon>of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson.

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,620
<2-21,Sheldon>当年  这文章被人给驳回了
<2-21,Sheldon>Now, initially, the paper was rejected,

53
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,990
<2-21,Sheldon>知道最近  才验证出  其实他是对的
<2-21,Sheldon>but recently, he was proven right.

54
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,140
<2-21,Sheldon>现在他要得诺贝尔奖  简直探囊取物
<2-21,Sheldon>And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,680
<2-22,Penny>这不就是我刚说的吗
<2-22,Penny>Yeah, that's basically what I said.

56
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,670
<2-23,Sheldon>重点是
<2-23,Sheldon>The point is

57
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,180
<2-23,Sheldon>希格斯正被人赞赏着他50年前的发现
<2-23,Sheldon>Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago,

58
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,410
<2-23,Sheldon>这让我不禁思考
<2-23,Sheldon>so that got me thinking,

59
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,780
<2-23,Sheldon>说不定我早想到了值得得奖的东西
<2-23,Sheldon>perhaps I've already hit upon the idea

60
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,060
<2-23,Sheldon>而它们就藏在这些日志里
<2-23,Sheldon>that will win me my Nobel prize.

61
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,840
<2-24,Leonard>原来他们会颁发奖项给
<2-24,Leonard>I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,030
<2-24,Leonard>拉粑粑进小马桶呀
<2-24,Leonard>for making boom-boom in the potty.

63
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,600
<2-25,Penny>你真的觉得里面能找出什么科学发现吗
<2-25,Penny>You really think there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,480
<2-26,Sheldon>这箱子里只有我上幼儿园前的作品
<2-26,Sheldon>Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school.

65
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,920
<2-26,Sheldon>后面还有很多呢
<2-26,Sheldon>There's a good deal more to come.

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,390
<2-26,Sheldon>我真正在学术理论上取得进步
<2-26,Sheldon>I didn't really hit my academic stride

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,790
<2-26,Sheldon>是在我取消了浪费时间的"户外游玩"之后
<2-26,Sheldon>until I cut out that time-suck known as "playing outdoors."

68
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,060
<2-27,Leonard>你打算花费大把时间
<2-27,Leonard>So, you're going to spend hours and hours

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,400
<2-27,Leonard>重读这些玩意啊
<2-27,Leonard>combing through all this stuff?

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,430
<2-28,Sheldon>这话说得对
<2-28,Sheldon>That's a good point.

71
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,400
<2-28,Sheldon>我的时间太宝贵了
<2-28,Sheldon>My time is much too valuable.

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,890
<2-28,Sheldon>或许我该找个人帮我干这事
<2-28,Sheldon>You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me.

73
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,390
<2-28,Sheldon>找个有着基本科学知识
<2-28,Sheldon>You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science,

74
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,100
<2-28,Sheldon>但在苦力活上更有天分的人
<2-28,Sheldon>but whose real talents lie in menial labor.

75
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,360
<2-29,Leonard>想都别想
<2-29,Leonard>Not gonna happen.

76
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,850
<2-30,Sheldon>我要不是觉得你能行
<2-30,Sheldon>Yeah, well, if I didn't think you could handle it,

77
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,320
<2-30,Sheldon>我才不会问你呢
<2-30,Sheldon>I wouldn't be asking.

78
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,110
<2-31,Leonard>真要人帮忙  你还是去找个研究生吧
<2-31,Leonard>If you want help, just hire a grad student.

79
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,270
<2-32,Penny>我说不定能帮上忙啊
<2-32,Penny>Maybe I could do it.

80
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,500
<2-32,Penny>就你  真的吗
<2-32,Penny>You, really?

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,710
<2-33,Sheldon>你会懂得评估我作品的好坏吗
<2-33,Sheldon>You can assess the quality of my work?

82
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,310
<2-33,Sheldon>好吧  给
<2-33,Sheldon>Okay, um, here.

83
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,540
<2-33,Sheldon>这是我五岁时写的
<2-33,Sheldon>I wrote this when I was five years old.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,300
<2-34,Penny>"证明代数拓扑永远不会有
<2-34,Penny>"A proof that algebraic topology can never have

85
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,060
<2-34,Penny>不会自我冲突的交换群"
<2-34,Penny>a non-self contradictory set of abelian groups."

86
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,960
<2-34,Penny>在你眼里  我就是一金发猴子是吧
<2-34,Penny>I'm just a blonde monkey to you, aren't I?

87
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,760
<2-35,Sheldon>这可是自己说  我什么都没说
<2-35,Sheldon>You said it, not me.

89
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,740
<3-1,Sheldon>好的  詹森女士
<3-1,Sheldon>All right, Ms. Jenson.

90
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,520
<3-1,Sheldon>开始之前  需要来点东西提神吗
<3-1,Sheldon>Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment?

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,760
<3-1,Sheldon>水  咖啡  茶
<3-1,Sheldon>Water, coffee, tea,

92
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,670
<3-1,Sheldon>或来根大麻烟吗
<3-1,Sheldon>a marijuana cigarette?

93
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,340
<3-2,Ms Jenson>不用了  谢谢  不需要
<3-2,Ms Jenson>No, thanks. I'm fine.

94
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,690
<3-3,Sheldon>不用客气哦
<3-3,Sheldon>Now, are you sure?

95
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,800
<3-3,Sheldon>这玩意大家都抽
<3-3,Sheldon>Everyone's smoking them.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,970
<3-3,Sheldon>我觉得这玩意爽爆了
<3-3,Sheldon>I think they're the best.

97
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,920
<3-4,Ms Jenson>我不碰毒
<3-4,Ms Jenson>I don't do drugs.

98
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,250
<3-5,Sheldon>太棒了
<3-5,Sheldon>Excellent, yeah.

99
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,570
<3-5,Sheldon>刚是陷阱题
<3-5,Sheldon>That was a ruse.

100
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,050
<3-5,Sheldon>那玩意才不爽
<3-5,Sheldon>They're not the best.

101
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,020
<3-5,Sheldon>物理才是最爽的
<3-5,Sheldon>Physics is the best.

102
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,880
<3-5,Sheldon>随便说句  选咖啡也是不行的哦
<3-5,Sheldon>And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice.

103
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,590
<3-5,Sheldon>好了  资料上写着你来自爱荷华州的得梅因
<3-5,Sheldon>All right, so I see here you're from Des Moines, Iowa.

104
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,070
<3-5,Sheldon>你的理论物理学以最优异的成绩
<3-5,Sheldon>Uh, you're summa cum laude in theoretical physics

105
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,750
<3-5,Sheldon>毕业于斯坦福大学
<3-5,Sheldon>from Stanford University.

106
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,410
<3-5,Sheldon>两年前  你耳朵受持续性感染所苦
<3-5,Sheldon>Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection.

107
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,710
<3-5,Sheldon>希望那没影响你的听力
<3-5,Sheldon>I hope that didn't cause any hearing loss.

108
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,190
<3-6,Ms Jenson>没有  当然没有
<3-6,Ms Jenson>No, of course not.

109
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,370
<3-6,Ms Jenson>你是怎么知道的
<3-6,Ms Jenson>How did you know about that?

110
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,630
<3-7,Sheldon>我对你的背景做了全面的调查
<3-7,Sheldon>I did a comprehensive background check.

111
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,390
<3-7,Sheldon>医疗记录  信用记录  犯罪史等等
<3-7,Sheldon>Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.

112
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,400
<3-7,Sheldon>我相信你已经缴清了那些停车罚单了吧
<3-7,Sheldon>I trust you paid off those parking tickets.

113
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,150
<3-8,Ms Jenson>是的  我付清了
<3-8,Ms Jenson>Yes, I did.

114
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,380
<3-9,Sheldon>很好  听力没问题
<3-9,Sheldon>Hearing unimpaired, good.

115
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,860
<3-10,Ms Jenson>库珀博士  我真的很希望能得到这个机会
<3-10,Ms Jenson>Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position.

116
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,970
<3-10,Ms Jenson>能为您这样才华洋溢的人做事
<3-10,Ms Jenson>It would be an incredible honor to work for

117
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,550
<3-10,Ms Jenson>真是我天大的荣幸
<3-10,Ms Jenson>a man of your brilliance.

118
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,940
<3-11,Sheldon>溜须拍马是没用的  詹森女士
<3-11,Sheldon>Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.

119
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,900
<3-12,Ms Jenson>陈述的是事实  又何来逢迎拍马

150
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,850
<5-4,Howard>还记得联盟号宇宙飞船吗
<5-4,Howard>Well, remember the... Soyuz capsule

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,320
<5-4,Howard>那个要来接我们回地球的玩意

155
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,580
<5-6,Howard>俄罗斯人说的  我也不敢信
<5-6,Howard>It's the Russians, so you don't know.

157
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,070
<5-6,Howard>他们送上来的狗  尸体都没回去呢
<5-6,Howard>They left dogs up here in the '60s.

158
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,130
<5-7,Bernadette>拜托  霍华德
<5-7,Bernadette>Come on, Howard.

159
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,900
<5-7,Bernadette>没人会把你留那里不管的
<5-7,Bernadette>No one's leaving you up there.

160
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,940
<5-8,Howard>我不知道我还能坚持多久
<5-8,Howard>I don't know how much longer I can take this.

161
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,300
<5-8,Howard>我睡不着
<5-8,Howard>I can't sleep,

162
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,660
<5-8,Howard>零重力让我胃酸倒流得厉害
<5-8,Howard>and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux.

163
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,580
<5-8,Howard>我的抗酸补钙果味咀嚼片就剩最后3片了
<5-8,Howard>I'm down to my last three Tums.

164
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,080
<5-8,Howard>你会没事的
<5-8,Howard>You're going to be fine.

165
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,140
<5-9,Bernadette>你跟你妈参加减肥训练营  你都生存下来了
<5-9,Bernadette>You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom.

166
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,460
<5-9,Bernadette>令人开心的冰激凌不也是第二天就没了吗
<5-9,Bernadette>And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two.

167
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,300
<5-9,Bernadette>你先冷静下来  深呼吸几口气
<5-9,Bernadette>Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.

168
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,950
<5-10,Howard>好吧  好吧
<5-10,Howard>Okay, okay.

169
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,210
<5-10,Howard>我这是干嘛  把氧气都耗光了
<5-10,Howard>What am I doing? I'm using up all the oxygen.

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,440
<5-10,Howard>如果我死了  你要保证会为我守身如玉
<5-10,Howard>If I die, promise you'll never have sex with another man.

171
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,820
<6-1,Amy>很好
<6-1,Amy>Oh, yeah.

172
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,780
<6-1,Amy>我现在是个食男妇了
<6-1,Amy>I'm a man-eater now.

173
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,690
<6-2,Penny>好了  最后一步  用这个睫毛夹
<6-2,Penny>Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler.

174
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,560
<6-2,Penny>放在你睫毛上  然后贴近眼皮轻轻夹
<6-2,Penny>You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.

175
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,830
<6-3,Amy>不知道呢
<6-3,Amy>Oh, I don't know.

176

<6-3,Amy>迪士尼动画片《小飞侠》中
<6-3,Amy>小飞侠彼得潘的精灵小伙伴

177
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,790
<6-3,Amy>看起来像仙女小叮当的妇科医生的工具
<6-3,Amy>Looks like something used by Tinker Bell's gynecologist.

178
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,930
<6-3,Amy>虎克船长出自迪士尼动画片《小飞侠》
<6-3,Amy>有着铁钩手的凶恶坏人

179
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,930
<6-4,Penny>但愿她的妇科医生不是虎克船长
<6-4,Penny>Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so...

180
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,140
<6-4,Penny>你打给谁

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,540
<6-5,Amy>我要跟谢尔顿视频聊天
<6-5,Amy>I'm going to video-chat Sheldon.

182
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,250
<6-5,Amy>如果我的新形象激发起他的性欲
<6-5,Amy>If my new look leads to phone sex,

183
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,090
<6-5,Amy>那你只好暂时离开房间一下咯
<6-5,Amy>I'm going to have to ask you to leave the room.

<6-10,Alex>unless you're Stephen Hawking, his mother

<6-11,Amy>-告诉他艾米找他  -请问您贵姓
<6-11,Amy>- Well, tell him Amy called. - Last name?

<6-13,Amy>他知道我姓什么

<6-15,Amy>- Hmm, that's weird.  - What?

200
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,090
<6-17,Amy>谢尔顿告诉我他新的助理叫艾利克斯
<6-17,Amy>Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex.

201
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,250
<6-17,Amy>却没说是个女艾利克斯
<6-17,Amy>He didn't mention that Alex was a girl.

202
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,000
<6-18,Penny>也许是他没发现人家是女的呢
<6-18,Penny>Maybe he didn't notice.

203
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,200
<6-18,Penny>有道理
<6-18,Penny>You're right.

204
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
<6-19,Amy>我完全不必担心谢尔顿
<6-19,Amy>I don't have to worry about Sheldon.

205
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,760
<6-20,Penny>确实
<6-20,Penny>No, you do not.

206
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,030
<6-21,Amy>我该担心的是那个女的
<6-21,Amy>It's her I have to worry about.

207
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,720
<6-22,Penny>艾米你不是吧
<6-22,Penny>Oh, Amy, really?

208
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,500
<6-22,Penny>-她会爱上谢尔顿的  -怎么可能
<6-22,Penny>- She is not going to come on to Sheldon.  - Oh, really?

209
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,900
<6-23,Amy>看看这萌脸
<6-23,Amy>Look at this face.

210
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,450
<6-23,Amy>一个女人每天与这萌脸共处八小时
<6-23,Amy>How can any woman spend eight hours a day

211
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,950
<6-23,Amy>怎么可能不爱上他呢
<6-23,Amy>alone with this face and not fall in love with it?

212
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,100
<6-24,Penny>首先我要说
<6-24,Penny>Well, for starters,

213
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,420
<6-24,Penny>那脸一开始讲话  就什么都幻灭了
<6-24,Penny>at some point, that face starts talking.

214
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,890
<7-1,Penny>艾米  这太夸张了
<7-1,Penny>Amy, this is crazy.

215
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,590
<7-1,Penny>你根本不用怀疑什么
<7-1,Penny>You have nothing to be suspicious about.

216
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,880
<7-2,Amy>我不是怀疑
<7-2,Amy>I'm not suspicious.

217
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,250
<7-2,Amy>我只是路过  跟我男朋友打个招呼
<7-2,Amy>I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend

218
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,670
<7-2,Amy>然后见见新助理
<7-2,Amy>and meet his new assistant.

219
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,420
<7-3,Penny>-可以走了吗  -稍等
<7-3,Penny>- Can we go now?  - Hang on.

220
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
<7-5,Penny>你干什么呢
<7-5,Penny>What are you doing?

221
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
<7-6,Amy>这还不明显吗
<7-6,Amy>Isn't it obvious?

222
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,360
<7-6,Amy>我在用体味申明领地
<7-6,Amy>I'm spreading my scent to mark my territory.

223
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,840
<7-7,Penny>-得了吧  没用的  -真的吗
<7-7,Penny>- Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.  - Really?

224
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,140
<7-8,Amy>在你成为我闺蜜之前
<7-8,Amy>Because just before you became my best friend,

225
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,520
<7-8,Amy>我也对你整间公寓做了同样的事
<7-8,Amy>I did this all over your apartment.

226
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,340
<8-1,Raj>你的助理  有提到过我吗
<8-1,Raj>Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?

227
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,950
<8-2,Sheldon>其实还真有
<8-2,Sheldon>In fact, she has.

228
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,580
<8-2,Sheldon>她的原话是  "这家伙什么毛病"
<8-2,Sheldon>Uh, her exact words were, "What is that guy's problem?"

229
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,860
<8-3,Raj>她记住我了  好戏开始
<8-3,Raj>I'm in her head. Let the dance begin.

238
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,940
<8-13,Alex>下面的我没检查
<8-13,Alex>I didn't check the one on the bottom.

239
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,470
<8-15,Alex>不好意思  库珀博士
<8-15,Alex>I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.

240
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,460
<8-16,Sheldon>没事的  艾利克斯
<8-16,Sheldon>It's all right, Alex.

241
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,420
<8-16,Sheldon>我并不生气  只是很失望
<8-16,Sheldon>I'm not mad at you; I'm just disappointed.

242
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,100
<8-17,Leonard>等等  艾利克斯  要跟我们一起吃吗
<8-17,Leonard>Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?

243
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,170
<8-19,Sheldon>艾利克斯  稍等片刻
<8-19,Sheldon>Uh, Alex, a moment.

244
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,200
<8-19,Sheldon>我有些话要跟霍夫斯塔德博士说
<8-19,Sheldon>I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter.

245
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,310
<8-19,Sheldon>你觉得她跟我们一起坐合适吗
<8-19,Sheldon>Do you think it's appropriate for her to sit with us,

246
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,360
<8-20,Leonard>就凭她的身份
<8-20,Leonard>given her station?

247
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,430
<8-20,Leonard>凭她的什么
<8-20,Leonard>Given her what?

248
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,140
<8-21,Sheldon>要说我从PBS台的英剧里学到什么的话
<8-21,Sheldon>If I've learned anything from British television shows on PBS,

249
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,450
<8-21,Sheldon>那就是仆人和他的同伴们都是坐楼下吃饭的
<8-21,Sheldon>it's that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.

250
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,150
<8-22,Leonard>什么
<8-22,Leonard>What?

251
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,000
<8-23,Sheldon>这是种仁慈  莱纳德
<8-23,Sheldon>It's a kindness, Leonard.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,940
<8-23,Sheldon>不然的话你就是在残酷地引诱他们
<8-23,Sheldon>Otherwise, you're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse

253
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,300
<8-23,Sheldon>体验一下比满手油烟更高层次的生活
<8-23,Sheldon>of a world that's just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.

254
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,430
<8-24,Leonard>那必须
<8-24,Leonard>Oh, sure.

255
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,700
<8-24,Leonard>请坐吧
<8-24,Leonard>Please join us.

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,070
<8-25,Alex>好的  谢谢
<8-25,Alex>Oh, okay. Thank you.

257
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,020
<8-26,Leonard>艾利克斯  你毕业论文的题目是什么
<8-26,Leonard>So, Alex, what's the topic of your dissertation?

258
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,850
<8-27,Alex>在地球的L5拉格朗日点
<8-27,Alex>I'm looking for Trojan asteroids

259
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,550
<8-27,Alex>寻找特洛伊小行星
<8-27,Alex>at Earth's L-Five Lagrange point.

260
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,460
<8-28,Leonard>这正巧是
<8-28,Leonard>Oh, that happens to be

261
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,560
<8-28,Leonard>库萨帕里博士的专业领域呢
<8-28,Leonard>Dr. Koothrappali's field of expertise.

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,640
<8-28,Leonard>你们有很多东西可以聊
<8-28,Leonard>You two have a lot to talk about.

263
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,010
<8-29,Alex>真的吗
<8-29,Alex>Is that true?

264
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,750
<8-29,Alex>他还好吗
<8-29,Alex>Is he all right?

265
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,270
<8-29,Alex>不
<8-29,Alex>No.

266
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,730
<8-30,Leonard>但跟你的老板相比
<8-30,Leonard>But compared to your boss,

267
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,150
<8-30,Leonard>他就是精神正常的代表
<8-30,Leonard>he's the poster boy for sanity.

268
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,130
<8-31,Alex>还好啦  我这辈子都在和科学家打交道
<8-31,Alex>It's okay, I've been around scientists all my life.

269
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,970
<8-31,Alex>我爸是SETI的天文学家
<8-31,Alex>My dad's an astronomer at SETI.

270
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,020
<8-32,Leonard>SETI  寻找外太空星球智慧生命计划
<8-32,Leonard>Oh, SETI-- the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

271
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,380
<8-32,Leonard>把谢尔顿介绍给你爸  他就不用搜寻了
<8-32,Leonard>You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.

272
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,150
<8-33,Alex>那你是做什么研究的
<8-33,Alex>So, what kind of research are you doing?

273
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,220
<8-34,Leonard>-高能激光  -军用吗
<8-34,Leonard>- High-energy lasers.  - Ooh. Military?

274
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,050
<8-36,Leonard>还没呢  但我能从两英里外替人激光除毛
<8-36,Leonard>Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.

275
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,700
<8-37,Amy (to Penny, on other side of room)>你是对的
<8-37,Amy (to Penny, on other side of room)>You were right.

276
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,180
<8-37,Amy (to Penny, on other side of room)>我没什么可担心的
<8-37,Amy (to Penny, on other side of room)>I had nothing to worry about.

277
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,480
<8-37,Amy (to Penny, on other side of room)>这骚货是你的问题  不是我的
<8-37,Amy (to Penny, on other side of room)>That skank's your problem, not mine.

278

<8-38,Alex>-你真幽默  霍夫斯塔德博士  -谢谢
<8-38,Alex>- You're very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.  - Thank you.

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,450
<8-40,Sheldon (choking)>啊  樱茎  樱茎
<8-40,Sheldon (choking)>Aah! Cherry stem! Cherry stem!

280
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,700
<9-1,Bernadette>华仔你还好吗  感觉好点了吗
<9-1,Bernadette>How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?

281
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,380
<9-2,Howard>好多了  谢谢  等一下
<9-2,Howard>Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec.

282
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
<9-2,Howard>听好了  我时间不多
<9-2,Howard>Listen close. I don't have a lot of time.

283
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,670
<9-2,Howard>我要你赶紧去我家
<9-2,Howard>I need you to go to my house.

284
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,180
<9-2,Howard>在我房间里有个火箭模型
<9-2,Howard>In my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket.

285
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,200
<9-2,Howard>我要你把它带回你家
<9-2,Howard>I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.

286
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,760
<9-3,Bernadette>好的
<9-3,Bernadette>Okay...

287
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,780
<9-4,Howard>第二步  照着建一个14层楼高的版本
<9-4,Howard>Step 2: build a version roughly 14 stories high.

288
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,610
<9-4,Howard>装满火箭燃油来接我
<9-4,Howard>Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me.

289
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,630
<9-4,Howard>我会给你把门留着的
<9-4,Howard>I'll leave the door unlocked.

290
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,310
<9-5,Bernadette>华仔  亲爱的  也许你该跟别人谈谈
<9-5,Bernadette>Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone,

291
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,390
<9-5,Bernadette>让他们知道你有些焦虑
<9-5,Bernadette>let them know you're having a little anxiety.

292
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,550
<9-5,Bernadette>不  不  我很好
<9-5,Bernadette>No, no, I'm fine.

293
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,290
<9-6,Howard>没有焦虑症
<9-6,Howard>No anxiety!

294
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,910
<9-6,Howard>咱们还是用暗号交流吧
<9-6,Howard>We should probably talk in code.

295
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,710
<9-6,Howard>从现在起  小蛙是我  三明治是你
<9-6,Howard>From now on, "Frog" is me, "Sandwich" means you

296
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,200
<9-6,Howard>柠檬是火箭  快点  三明治
<9-6,Howard>and "Lemon" means rocket. So, come on, sandwich,

297
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,920
<9-6,Howard>给我造架柠檬  小蛙要回家
<9-6,Howard>build me a lemon 'cause froggy wants to come home!

298
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,020
<10-1,Amy>瞧你  还假装坚强
<10-1,Amy>Look at you, putting on a brave face.

299
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,240
<10-2,Penny>没什么好需要坚强的
<10-2,Penny>There's nothing to be brave about.

300
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,680
<10-2,Penny>-我没事  -真的吗
<10-2,Penny>- Everything's fine. - Really?

301
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,100
<10-3,Amy>我不知道你对灵长类动物行为知道多少
<10-3,Amy>I don't know how much you know about primate behavior,

302
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,870
<10-3,Amy>不过谢尔顿的助理绝对在向莱纳德求欢
<10-3,Amy>but Sheldon's assistant was clearly courting Leonard.

303
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,460
<10-3,Amy>如果她是狒狒  肯定会弯下身
<10-3,Amy>Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over

304
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,500
<10-3,Amy>展示她那看似大红色蹭鞋垫的
<10-3,Amy>and displayed her brightly colored hindquarters

305
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,240
<10-3,Amy>鲜亮斑斓后臀
<10-3,Amy>like a big red welcome mat.

306
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,810
<10-3,Amy>顺便说下  如果在低年级毕业舞会上试这招
<10-3,Amy>By the way, you try that at the junior prom,

307
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,260
<10-3,Amy>会被踢出去的
<10-3,Amy>you get kicked out.

308
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,850
<10-4,Penny>好吧  也许她是在和他调情  可谁在乎啊
<10-4,Penny>Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares?

309
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,760
<10-4,Penny>我都不知道我现在和莱纳德的关系算什么
<10-4,Penny>Look, I don't even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.

310
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,850
<10-5,Amy>这是你的前额叶在说话
<10-5,Amy>So says your prefrontal cortex.

311
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,970
<10-5,Amy>但同时  你大脑中的边缘系统在计算
<10-5,Amy>But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating

312
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,740
<10-5,Amy>如果有另一个女人对莱纳德有兴趣
<10-5,Amy>that if another woman is attracted to Leonard,

313
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,140
<10-5,Amy>那肯定是因为他值得拥有
<10-5,Amy>it must be because he's desirable.

314
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,650
<10-6,Penny>他当然值得拥有了
<10-6,Penny>Well, of course he's desirable.

315
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,420
<10-6,Penny>他棒极了
<10-6,Penny>I mean, he's great.

316
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,070
<10-6,Penny>他聪明  温柔
<10-6,Penny>He's smart, he's sweet,

317
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,530
<10-6,Penny>而且在房事上  老天
<10-6,Penny>and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew,

318
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,520
<10-6,Penny>我告诉你  他真是拼了老命了
<10-6,Penny>let me tell you, he really tries.

319
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,060
<10-7,Amy>所以这事让你烦心
<10-7,Amy>So it doesbother you.

320
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,700
<10-8,Penny>好吧  是让我有点烦
<10-8,Penny>Fine, it bothers me a little.

321
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,430
<10-8,Penny>算了  这太傻了
<10-8,Penny>No. You know what? This is stupid.

322
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,830
<10-8,Penny>我才不烦呢
<10-8,Penny>It doesn't bother me.

323
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,900
<10-8,Penny>好吧  我很烦
<10-8,Penny>Okay, it bothers me.

324
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,800
<10-8,Penny>但只是因为她很捧场他的笑话
<10-8,Penny>But only because she wouldn't stop laughing.

325
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,270
<10-8,Penny>莱纳德没那么幽默搞笑
<10-8,Penny>Leonard is not that funny.

326
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,980
<10-9,Amy>这就是了
<10-9,Amy>And there you have it;

327
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,810
<10-9,Amy>前额叶理性对抗边缘系统的欲望
<10-9,Amy>prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust.

328
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,430
<10-9,Amy>如果这是拳击赛  就会叫做
<10-9,Amy>If this were a boxing match, they might call it

330
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,380
<10-9,Amy>"扁桃体的震颤"
<10-9,Amy>"The thrilla adjacent to the amygdala."

331
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,260
<10-9,Amy>如果你是脑部学家
<10-9,Amy>If you were a brain scientist,

332
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,870
<10-9,Amy>你现在肯定会笑到尿裤子
<10-9,Amy>you would be busting a gut right now!

333
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,140
<11-1,Penny>今天工作怎么样
<11-1,Penny>So, how was work today?

334
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,810
<11-2,Leonard>还行吧
<11-2,Leonard>Ah, it was all right, I guess.

335
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,480
<11-2,Leonard>用海氏急救法拯救樱桃梗卡气管的谢尔顿
<11-2,Leonard>Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon.

336
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,410
<11-2,Leonard>结果那梗还喷到拉杰的眼睛
<11-2,Leonard>Caught Raj right in the eye.

337
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,870
<11-3,Penny>真的假的
<11-3,Penny>You're kidding.

338
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,590
<11-4,Leonard>拉杰都得去医疗室了
<11-4,Leonard>No, Raj had to go to the nurse.

339
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,080
<11-5,Penny>还有什么事吗
<11-5,Penny>Wow. Anything else?

340
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,540
<11-6,Leonard>护士是个女的  所以他没法开口说话
<11-6,Leonard>Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn't talk to her.

341
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,090
<11-6,Leonard>她不得不给他拿个芝麻街里的公仔
<11-6,Leonard>She had to bring him a Grover puppet

342
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,010
<11-6,Leonard>让他指出他哪里疼
<11-6,Leonard>so he could point at what hurt.

343
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,990
<11-7,Penny>就这些吗
<11-7,Penny>Is that it?

344
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,960
<11-8,Leonard>这还不够精彩吗
<11-8,Leonard>Isn't that enough?

345
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,930
<11-8,Leonard>有武器化的水果与公仔
<11-8,Leonard>It had the weaponized fruit and a puppet.

346
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,590
<11-8,Leonard>你还想听什么刺激的
<11-8,Leonard>What more do you want?

347
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,150
<11-9,Sheldon (arriving with Alex)>太好了  莱纳德  你在家
<11-9,Sheldon (arriving with Alex)>Oh, good, Leonard, you're here.

<11-9,Sheldon (arriving with Alex)>Science news.

349
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,820
<11-9,Sheldon (arriving with Alex)>你会有兴趣的
<11-9,Sheldon (arriving with Alex)>This will interest you.

350
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
<11-9,Sheldon (arriving with Alex)>佩妮  想涂指甲请随意
<11-9,Sheldon (arriving with Alex)>And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.

351
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,920
<11-10,Leonard>有什么新鲜事
<11-10,Leonard>What do you got?
