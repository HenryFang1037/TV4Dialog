1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,090
<1-1,Raj>下狗式
<1-1,Raj>You know, downward-facing dog

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,420
<1-1,Raj>是来自梵文中的"朝下  面  犬  体式"
<1-1,Raj>comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,750
<1-2,Penny>好美  是什么意思
<1-2,Penny>Oh, that's beautiful. What does it mean?

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,570
<1-3,Raj>"下犬式"
<1-3,Raj>"Downward-facing dog."

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,480
<1-4,Penny>好吧  我猜梵文里大概没有
<1-4,Penny>Yeah, I guess they don't have Sanskrit

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,290
<1-4,Penny>"屁股朝上头朝下"
<1-4,Penny>for "Butts up and heads down."

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,900
<1-5,Raj>印度性爱圣经可是我们写的
<1-5,Raj>Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,680
<1-5,Raj>跟屁股扯上边的  我们肯定有那个词
<1-5,Raj>If it involves butts, there's a word for it.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,760
<1-6,Leonard>我们不是要在上班前吃早饭吗
<1-6,Leonard>I thought we were getting breakfast before work.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,240
<1-7,Penny>我忘了  抱歉
<1-7,Penny>Oh, right, sorry.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,470
<1-8,Raj>是我的错  我邀请佩妮跟我一起做瑜伽
<1-8,Raj>It's my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,330
<1-9,Penny>如果要  我可以在五分钟内换好衣服啊
<1-9,Penny>If you want, I can get ready in five minutes.

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,920
<1-10,Leonard>你盲目自信的样子真可爱
<1-10,Leonard>It's cute that you think that.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,570
<1-10,Leonard>算了  没事
<1-10,Leonard>Don't worry about it.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,600
<1-11,Raj>我能请你帮个忙吗
<1-11,Raj>Hey, can I ask you a favor?

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
<1-11,Raj>能不能帮忙我去遛一下小桂子
<1-11,Raj>Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,010
<1-12,Leonard>没问题啊  你免费在这住
<1-12,Leonard>Sure. You're living here for free.

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,060
<1-12,Leonard>我当然是欠你的啦
<1-12,Leonard>I guess I owe you.

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,180
<1-13,Raj>再见啦  小桂子  你要乖啊
<1-13,Raj>Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,650
<1-14,Penny>-再见啦  小宝贝  -再见
<1-14,Penny>- Yeah, bye, sweetie! - Bye!

21
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,860
<1-16,Penny>再见  莱纳德
<1-16,Penny>Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,680
<1-17,Raj>树式
<1-17,Raj>Okay, and tree pose.

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,340
<1-18,Leonard>她"完事"了
<1-18,Leonard>Well, she's done.

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,180
<2-1,Sheldon>最近我们研发
<2-1,Sheldon>Things have been going really well

39
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,510
<2-1,Sheldon>无限持续陀螺仪很顺利呢
<2-1,Sheldon>with the infinite resistance gyroscope.

40
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,450
<2-2,Amy>那很好啊  怎么顺利
<2-2,Amy>That's great. How so?

41
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,880
<2-3,Sheldon>这个项目是机密
<2-3,Sheldon>Oh, the project is classified.

42
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,660
<2-3,Sheldon>恕我不能透露
<2-3,Sheldon>I can't tell you.

43
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,420
<2-3,Sheldon>不过我可以把机密部分消音掉
<2-3,Sheldon>Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts.

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,730
<2-3,Sheldon>好的  我想出了一个绝妙的方法来解决...
<2-3,Sheldon>All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the...

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,010
<2-3,Sheldon>我用了...
<2-3,Sheldon>I used the...

46
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,470
<2-3,Sheldon>然后我...
<2-3,Sheldon>And then I...

47
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,130
<2-3,Sheldon>然后就成功啦
<2-3,Sheldon>And that did it.

48
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,230
<2-3,Sheldon>真好奇他们在消音什么
<2-3,Sheldon>Wow, I wonder what they're redacting.

49
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,330
<2-4,Amy>你怎么不问问我最近在研究什么
<2-4,Amy>Why don't you ask me what I'm working on?

50
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,790
<2-5,Sheldon>行啊  那你最近都在研究什么
<2-5,Sheldon>Oh, very well. What have you been working on?

51
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,990
<2-5,Sheldon>也欢迎你按喇叭消音掉无聊的部分
<2-5,Sheldon>And feel free to honk during the boring parts.

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,150
<2-6,Amy>我最近在做实验来表明
<2-6,Amy>I'm doing some experiments to show

53
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,000
<2-6,Amy>人体控制肌肉的信号
<2-6,Amy>that the signal to move a muscle occurs

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,450
<2-6,Amy>是在大脑做出决定前就发送出去了
<2-6,Amy>before you know you even decided to move it.

55
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,620
<2-7,Sheldon>所以你在尝试做实验找出
<2-7,Sheldon>W... So you're attempting to pinpoint

56
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,140
<2-7,Sheldon>意识在大脑中存在的位置
<2-7,Sheldon>where consciousness resides in the brain.

57
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,540
<2-8,Amy>是的  我在试着得出何处与何时
<2-8,Amy>Yes, I'm trying to figure out the nanometer

58
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,930
<2-8,Amy>意识在大脑中产生
<2-8,Amy>and the attosecond, precisely where and when

59
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,500
<2-8,Amy>精确到纳米与原子秒
<2-8,Amy>an event of awareness takes place.

60
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,110
<2-9,Sheldon>真是没想到
<2-9,Sheldon>Well, what do you know?

61
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,660
<2-9,Sheldon>本来我还等着要受无聊生物学的轰炸
<2-9,Sheldon>Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology,

62
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,440
<2-9,Sheldon>结果却让你搔到了我求知的痒处
<2-9,Sheldon>and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy.

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,260
<2-9,Sheldon>而这痒处不同于我的身体  是允许被搔的
<2-9,Sheldon>Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.

64
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,000
<2-10,Amy>在我六岁的时候
<2-10,Amy>You know, when I was six,

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,530
<2-10,Amy>我想要嫁给童书《晚安大猩猩》的那大猩猩
<2-10,Amy>I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla.

66
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,420
<2-10,Amy>或许当时我有点未卜先知了
<2-10,Amy>Maybe I was onto something.

67
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,110
<3-1,Sheldon>先生们  刚才我跟这根汤匙
<3-1,Sheldon>Gentlemen, the most interesting thing

68
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,950
<3-1,Sheldon>发生了一件史上最有趣的事
<3-1,Sheldon>just happened with this spoon.

69
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,660
<3-2,Howard>除非它对你唱《当我们座上宾》  不然我不信
<3-2,Howard>Unless it was singing "Be Our Guest," I doubt it.

71
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,900
<3-3,Sheldon>我想都没想就挑了这根汤匙
<3-3,Sheldon>Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it.

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,160
<3-3,Sheldon>一个神经学的问题就产生了
<3-3,Sheldon>Which raises a neuroscientific question,

73
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,320
<3-3,Sheldon>我什么时候决定选择这根汤匙
<3-3,Sheldon>when did I decide to pick it up?

74
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,610
<3-4,Raj>更大的问题是  你要用那根汤匙吃什么
<3-4,Raj>The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon?

75
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,050
<3-4,Raj>你都没拿食物
<3-4,Raj>You didn't get any food.

76
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,150
<3-5,Leonard>他提的这点的确挺有意思
<3-5,Leonard>He does raise an interesting point.

77
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,540
<3-6,Sheldon>艾米正在研究意图与意识间的时间滞差
<3-6,Sheldon>Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness,

78
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,990
<3-6,Sheldon>而我意识到这也能
<3-6,Sheldon>and I realized that applies

79
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,330
<3-6,Sheldon>套用进量子力学里的测量问题上
<3-6,Sheldon>to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.

80
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,690
<3-6,Sheldon>我也意识到了在我说出来这话
<3-6,Sheldon>Now, I recognize there will be a time lag

81
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,880
<3-6,Sheldon>到你们用谷歌查之间也会有时间滞差
<3-6,Sheldon>between me saying that and you Googling what it means,

82
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,530
<3-6,Sheldon>所以我等你们
<3-6,Sheldon>so I'll wait.

83
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,020
<3-7,Leonard>我懂好吗  谢尔顿
<3-7,Leonard>I understand it, Sheldon.

84
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,540
<3-8,Raj>我也懂
<3-8,Raj>Yeah, me, too.

85
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,710
<3-9,Howard>抱歉  我放空了
<3-9,Howard>I'm sorry, I spaced.

86
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,610
<3-9,Howard>我们还在聊汤匙吗
<3-9,Howard>Are we still talking about the spoon?

87
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,130
<3-10,Raj>看到你对艾米的工作感到兴趣挺好的
<3-10,Raj>It's nice to see you taking an interest in Amy's work.

88
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,180
<3-11,Sheldon>别误会了
<3-11,Sheldon>Well, don't get me wrong.

89
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,260
<3-11,Sheldon>神经生物学不过就是研究
<3-11,Sheldon>Neurobiology's nothing more than the science

90
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,680
<3-11,Sheldon>灰色黏糊糊东西的科学
<3-11,Sheldon>of gray squishy stuff.

91
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,420
<3-11,Sheldon>但是当它跟物理学关联起来
<3-11,Sheldon>But, you know, when it connects to physics,

92
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,250
<3-11,Sheldon>给马喂好草料  师弟  咱们要直奔西天啦
<3-11,Sheldon>gas up the Ford, Martha, we're going for a drive.

93
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,690
<4-1,Raj>那你跟珍妮佛撕逼了吗
<4-1,Raj>So did you confront Jennifer?

94
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,380
<4-2,Penny>本来准备要  结果她请了病假
<4-2,Penny>I was going to, but she called in sick.

95
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,030
<4-2,Penny>你猜还有谁请了病假
<4-2,Penny>And guess who else called in sick.

96
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,920
<4-3,Raj>-保罗  -保罗
<4-3,Raj>- Paul. - Paul.

97
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,080
<4-3,Raj>谁是保罗啊
<4-3,Raj>Who's Paul?

98
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,620
<4-5,Leonard>我们办公室圣诞派对的时候你们见过面
<4-5,Leonard>Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party.

99
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,940
<4-6,Penny>是南希的老公
<4-6,Penny>He's married to Nancy.

100
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,890
<4-7,Leonard>那个人啊  等等  谁是南希
<4-7,Leonard>Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?

101
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,410
<4-8,Penny>我敢打赌珍妮佛能借此升职
<4-8,Penny>I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this,

102
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,040
<4-8,Penny>真是太不公平了  我比她加倍努力好吗
<4-8,Penny>which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.

103
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,710
<4-9,Raj>别担心啦  杰瑞不会被
<4-9,Raj>Don't worry, Jerry won't be fooled

104
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,040
<4-9,Raj>这种小把戏所欺骗
<4-9,Raj>by that type of behavior.

105
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,350
<4-10,Leonard>谁是杰瑞
<4-10,Leonard>Jerry?

106
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,640
<4-11,Raj>兰迪用这招不好使  蒂娜用这招也不好使
<4-11,Raj>It didn't work for Randy, it didn't work for Tina,

107
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,770
<4-11,Raj>所以肯定珍妮佛用这招也不好使
<4-11,Raj>it sure as hell isn't gonna work for Jennifer.

108
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,250
<4-12,Penny>但愿如此吧
<4-12,Penny>Well, I hope not.

109
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,410
<4-12,Penny>我只是很讨厌别人玩那种把戏
<4-12,Penny>I just hate when people play those kinds of games.

110
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,640
<4-13,Leonard>谁是蒂娜
<4-13,Leonard>Tina?

111
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,590
<4-14,Raj>凭你的销售记录  你根本无需担心
<4-14,Raj>With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about.

112
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,400
<4-16,Leonard>我是不是去了你办公室的假圣诞派对
<4-16,Leonard>I went to your office Christmas party?

113
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,160
<5-1,Amy>我喜欢上竖琴课
<5-1,Amy>You know, I like harp lessons,

114
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,130
<5-1,Amy>但我现在考虑要不要换成上电梯维修班了
<5-1,Amy>but I'm thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons.

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,810
<5-1,Amy>你在研究什么
<5-1,Amy>What are you working on?

116
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,130
<5-2,Sheldon>我刚在思考你的实验
<5-2,Sheldon>I was thinking about your experiment

117
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,040
<5-2,Sheldon>关于决策的神经科学
<5-2,Sheldon>on the neuroscience of decision making,

118
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,180
<5-2,Sheldon>然后我意识到
<5-2,Sheldon>and I realized,

119
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,460
<5-2,Sheldon>如果将其与量子力学中的测量问题相联系
<5-2,Sheldon>if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics,

120
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,800
<5-2,Sheldon>我们将有机会用哥本哈根诠释
<5-2,Sheldon>we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,530
<5-2,Sheldon>对意识的角色进行证伪
<5-2,Sheldon>in the Copenhagen Interpretation.

123
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,270
<5-3,Amy>等下  你是说如果将我的实验
<5-3,Amy>Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment

124
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,460
<5-3,Amy>跟你的计算相结合
<5-3,Amy>with your calculations,

125
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,520
<5-3,Amy>我们能及时推断出
<5-3,Amy>we can determine the precise moment in time

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,310
<5-3,Amy>波函数坍缩的确切时间
<5-3,Amy>when the wave function collapses?

127
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,180
<5-4,Sheldon>这可能是最有创造力的组合了
<5-4,Sheldon>It could be the most inspired combination

128
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,740
<5-4,Sheldon>之前是我把红色思乐冰混到蓝色思乐冰里
<5-4,Sheldon>since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee.

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,880
<5-4,Sheldon>喝起来就像在喝七彩虹中的两彩
<5-4,Sheldon>It was like drinking 2/7 of the rainbow.

130
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,710
<5-5,Amy>谢尔顿  这真是太有意思了
<5-5,Amy>Sheldon, this is really interesting.

131
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,300
<5-6,Sheldon>对啊  而且这个不会把我的牙染成紫色
<5-6,Sheldon>Yeah, and this one won't stain my teeth purple.

132
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,190
<5-7,Amy>我们之前从未在专业领域上合作过
<5-7,Amy>You know, we've never collaborated professionally before.

133
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,570
<5-7,Amy>你不担心这可能会影响我们的关系吗
<5-7,Amy>Are you worried it might affect our relationship?

134
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,300
<5-8,Sheldon>这个观点非常有道理
<5-8,Sheldon>That is a valid point.

135
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,190
<5-8,Sheldon>或许我们该确立一些基本规则
<5-8,Sheldon>Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.

136
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,560
<5-9,Amy>那样我感觉好多了
<5-9,Amy>Well, that would make me feel better.

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
<5-10,Sheldon>好吧  我们现在就开始吧
<5-10,Sheldon>All right, let's start right now.

138
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,040
<5-10,Sheldon>规则一
<5-10,Sheldon>Uh, rule number one,

139
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,370
<5-10,Sheldon>不许用性来达到目的
<5-10,Sheldon>no using sexuality to get your way.

140
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,860
<5-11,Amy>这规则真鬼扯
<5-11,Amy>That's a ridiculous rule.

141
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,590
<5-12,Sheldon>是咩
<5-12,Sheldon>Is it?

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,870
<6-1,Penny>好了  感觉如何
<6-1,Penny>Okay, how is that?

143
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
<6-2,Raj>我真的感觉到毒素
<6-2,Raj>I can actually feel the toxins

144
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,490
<6-2,Raj>被缓缓排出我的肌肤
<6-2,Raj>being pulled out of my skin.

145
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,900
<6-3,Penny>这是补水面膜
<6-3,Penny>Well, this is a moisturizing mask.

146
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,960
<6-4,Raj>好吧  那我真的感觉到
<6-4,Raj>Oh, well, then I can actually feel

147
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,610
<6-4,Raj>水分源源不断地注入我的肌肤
<6-4,Raj>the moisture going into my skin.

148
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,410
<6-5,Penny>希望你别介意
<6-5,Penny>Hey, I hope you don't mind,

149
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,610
<6-5,Penny>昨晚我用了一点你的眼霜
<6-5,Penny>I used a little of your eye cream last night.

150
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,330
<6-6,Raj>怪不得某人的双眸越来越紧致明亮
<6-6,Raj>I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.

151
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,840
<6-7,Leonard>我还是想知道杰瑞是谁
<6-7,Leonard>I'd still like to know who Jerry is.

152
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,290
<6-8,Penny>别纠结了  要不敷完面膜
<6-8,Penny>Don't worry about it. Hey, after this,

153
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,310
<6-8,Penny>我们一起出去做点什么吧
<6-8,Penny>how about we all go out and do something together?

154
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,730
<6-9,Leonard>那真是太棒了  谢谢
<6-9,Leonard>That would be great. Thank you.

155
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,570
<6-10,Raj>你想去逛街吗
<6-10,Raj>You want to go shopping?

156
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,380
<6-11,Penny>好呀  爽
<6-11,Penny>Ooh, yes. Fun.

157
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,720
<6-12,Leonard>或许我们可以做一些我们都喜欢的事
<6-12,Leonard>Or we could do something we'll all enjoy,

158
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,650
<6-12,Leonard>比如说玩桌游
<6-12,Leonard>like play a board game.

159
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
<6-12,Leonard>♪ 我在想  我和你 ♪
<6-12,Leonard>♪ Imagine me and you, I do ♪

170
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,480
<7-1,Sheldon>我已经把我们的基本规则制定出来了
<7-1,Sheldon>I believe I've made some progress on our ground rules.

171
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,430
<7-2,Amy>好的  都是什么
<7-2,Amy>Oh, good. What are they?

172
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,690
<7-3,Sheldon>规则一
<7-3,Sheldon>Okay, uh, number one:

173
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,000
<7-3,Sheldon>跟物理有关的
<7-3,Sheldon>in matters of physics,

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,620
<7-3,Sheldon>我有最终决定权
<7-3,Sheldon>I have the final say.

175
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,670
<7-3,Sheldon>跟神经科学有关的  你有最终决定权
<7-3,Sheldon>In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say.

176
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,580
<7-3,Sheldon>除非我不同意
<7-3,Sheldon>Unless I disagree.

177
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,240
<7-3,Sheldon>还有
<7-3,Sheldon>Oh, here.

178
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,250
<7-3,Sheldon>规则二  当论文出版时  我是第一作者
<7-3,Sheldon>Number two: when we publish, my name goes first.

179
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,220
<7-3,Sheldon>之后如果我们获任何奖  我第一个发言
<7-3,Sheldon>Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards, I speak first.

180
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,360
<7-4,Amy>我不想到我发言时  因时长被乐队奏乐赶下场
<7-4,Amy>I don't want to be talking when the orchestra plays us off.

181
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,410
<7-4,Amy>我能看看吗
<7-4,Amy>Can I see that?

182
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,420
<7-5,Sheldon>当然
<7-5,Sheldon>Oh, of course.

183
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,870
<7-5,Sheldon>我会拿回来的
<7-5,Sheldon>I'll get that back.

184
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,500
<7-5,Sheldon>就像我所有内裤  那个本子上也写着
<7-5,Sheldon>Like all my underwear, that notebook says

185
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,220
<7-5,Sheldon>"所有权归谢尔顿·库珀"
<7-5,Sheldon>"Property of Sheldon Cooper."

186
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,410
<7-6,Amy>谢尔顿  如果我们要制定基本规则
<7-6,Amy>Sheldon, if we're gonna have ground rules,

187
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,740
<7-6,Amy>那我告诉你第一条就是
<7-6,Amy>I'll tell you the first ground rule--

188
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,950
<7-6,Amy>基本规则我说了算
<7-6,Amy>I make the ground rules.

189
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,210
<7-7,Sheldon>我本来可以写下来  但现在不行了
<7-7,Sheldon>I'd write that down, but I can't now, can I?

190
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,970
<8-1,Leonard>我的意思是  他们虽然什么都没说
<8-1,Leonard>I mean, they didn't say anything,

191
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,340
<8-1,Leonard>但我却觉得自己有点像
<8-1,Leonard>but I just kind of felt like I was being

192
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,600
<8-1,Leonard>奇怪的电灯泡
<8-1,Leonard>a weird third wheel.

193
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,420
<8-2,Howard>所以你也懂那种感觉啊
<8-2,Howard>Huh, so you can tell what that feels like.

194
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,220
<8-2,Howard>有意思
<8-2,Howard>Interesting.

195
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,730
<8-3,Leonard>总之  我后来想我也可以跟我朋友出去
<8-3,Leonard>Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends

196
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,300
<8-3,Leonard>也会玩得很开心的呀
<8-3,Leonard>and have fun, too.

197
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,600
<8-4,Bernadette>如果你对开心的定义是坐着小面包车
<8-4,Bernadette>Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan

198
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
<8-4,Bernadette>去超市买尿布
<8-4,Bernadette>to Target for diapers,

199
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,010
<8-4,Bernadette>那准备好疯狂一把啦
<8-4,Bernadette>things are about to get nuts.

200
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,050
<8-5,Leonard>我只是觉得跟乐于与我玩耍的人
<8-5,Leonard>Oh, it's just nice to be with people

201
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,750
<8-5,Leonard>在一起感觉很好
<8-5,Leonard>who are happy to have me around.

202
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,570
<8-5,Leonard>是不是呀  哈雷
<8-5,Leonard>Isn't that right, Halley?

203
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,110
<8-7,Howard>至少有人敢于说出真相
<8-7,Howard>Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.

204
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,900
<9-1,Sheldon>谢谢  你真是个好市民
<9-1,Sheldon>Thank you, you are a good citizen.

205
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
<9-1,Sheldon>早说了吧
<9-1,Sheldon>Told you.

206
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,580
<9-1,Sheldon>去吧  把我内裤扔出窗外试试
<9-1,Sheldon>Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window.

207
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,480
<9-1,Sheldon>也会有人送回来
<9-1,Sheldon>Same thing's gonna happen.

208
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,430
<9-2,Amy>非常好
<9-2,Amy>Terrific.

209
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,290
<9-2,Amy>你想听听咱俩的新规则吗
<9-2,Amy>Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?

210
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,880
<9-3,Sheldon>说吧
<9-3,Sheldon>Fire away.

211
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,230
<9-4,Amy>第一条  我俩是队友
<9-4,Amy>Number one: we're on the same team,

212
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,800
<9-4,Amy>而不是对手
<9-4,Amy>we're not in competition.

213
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,060
<9-5,Sheldon>聪明  因为目前的比分可是谢尔顿赢了
<9-5,Sheldon>That's smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0.

214
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,590
<9-6,Amy>第二条  意见不同可以有礼貌地提出来
<9-6,Amy>Number two: disagreements can happen politely.

215
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,940
<9-6,Amy>不可以嘲讽别人的想法傻
<9-6,Amy>There's no need to call an idea stupid.

216
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,780
<9-7,Sheldon>哇  有人在上面画了个鸡鸡
<9-7,Sheldon>Aw, someone drew a penis in it.

217
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,800
<9-8,Amy>你有认真听吗
<9-8,Amy>Are you listening?

218
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,330
<9-9,Sheldon>抱歉  你继续
<9-9,Sheldon>I'm sorry, go ahead.

219
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,540
<9-9,Sheldon>第三条
<9-9,Sheldon>Number three.

220
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,040
<9-10,Amy>为了鼓舞士气   工作期间可以适当休息
<9-10,Amy>To avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks

221
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,610
<9-10,Amy>每完成一步都可以发个小奖励
<9-10,Amy>and reward our successes with a small treat.

222
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,220
<9-11,Sheldon>这个主意不错
<9-11,Sheldon>Ooh, that sounds fun.

223
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,080
<9-11,Sheldon>你指的是真正的奖励吧
<9-11,Sheldon>Now, we're talking about real treats, right?

224
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,510
<9-11,Sheldon>而不是我妈拿来糊弄我的圣经段子
<9-11,Sheldon>Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.

225
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,740
<9-12,Amy>你想要什么都行
<9-12,Amy>Whatever you want.

226
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,070
<9-12,Amy>那我们开工吧
<9-12,Amy>So, shall we get to work?

227
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,350
<9-13,Sheldon>生物与物理强强联合
<9-13,Sheldon>Biology and physics coming together--

229
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,570
<9-13,Sheldon>我们是智商界的花生酱巧克力
<9-13,Sheldon>this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind.

230
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,270
<9-13,Sheldon>人家知道想要什么奖励了
<9-13,Sheldon>Oh, I know what I want my treat to be!

245
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,110
<9-14,Amy>瞧瞧
<9-14,Amy>Wow, look at that.

246
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,030
<9-15,Sheldon>没错  实在是叹为观止
<9-15,Sheldon>Yes, this is remarkable.

247
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,420
<9-16,Amy>所以我们都觉得这完全是没用的垃圾
<9-16,Amy>So we're agreed: it's complete garbage.

248
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,110
<9-17,Sheldon>对了  你可以当第一作者
<9-17,Sheldon>By the way, your name can go first.

249
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,600
<10-1,Leonard>我很高兴看到他们相处融洽
<10-1,Leonard>I mean, I'm glad they're getting along,

250
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,630
<10-1,Leonard>但现在我开始有点不舒服了
<10-1,Leonard>but it's starting to make me uncomfortable.

251
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,110
<10-2,Bernadette>你是担心他会成为佩妮的小三吗
<10-2,Bernadette>Well, are you worried he's like another man in her life?

252
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,570
<10-3,Leonard>有一点  直到我看到他俩穿了闺蜜装
<10-3,Leonard>A little, until I saw them in matching tops, so...

253
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,270
<10-4,Howard>太好了  174片尿布
<10-4,Howard>Nice. 174 diapers.

254
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,160
<10-4,Howard>足够我们撑到周三啦
<10-4,Howard>That ought to get us to Wednesday.

255
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,800
<10-5,Bernadette>你跟他俩聊过这件事吗
<10-5,Bernadette>Well, have you talked to them about it?

256
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,140
<10-6,Leonard>我应该如何开口呀
<10-6,Leonard>Well, what am I supposed to say--

257
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,190
<10-6,Leonard>"不要背着我自己玩吗"
<10-6,Leonard>"Stop having fun without me"?

258
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,970
<10-7,Howard>我每次出门她都要这么说
<10-7,Howard>This one says that every time I go out.

259
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,610
<10-7,Howard>看到没  我还是有听你说话
<10-7,Howard>See? I listen to you.

260
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,990
<10-8,Bernadette>拉杰只是和女生特别处得来
<10-8,Bernadette>Look, Raj just gets along with women.

261
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,790
<10-8,Bernadette>我知道
<10-8,Bernadette>I-I know,

262
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,360
<10-9,Leonard>但他本来是我的朋友
<10-9,Leonard>but he was my friend first.

263
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,770
<10-9,Leonard>她就像是偷走了我的朋友
<10-9,Leonard>It's like she's stealing him

264
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,620
<10-9,Leonard>然后两人开开心心地
<10-9,Leonard>and they're just having the best time

265
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,450
<10-9,Leonard>做各种女生才做的蠢事
<10-9,Leonard>doing all their dumb girly stuff together.

266
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,360
<10-10,Howard>你确定自己融不进去吗
<10-10,Howard>You sure you don't fit in?

267
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,080
<10-10,Howard>某人听起来还挺像个小婊子啊
<10-10,Howard>You sound like a catty bitch to me.

268
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,330
<11-1,Amy>我不知道到底是哪里出错了
<11-1,Amy>I don't know where we went wrong.

269
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,560
<11-2,Sheldon>这些计算乱七八糟
<11-2,Sheldon>Yeah, the math is so inelegant.

270
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,920
<11-2,Sheldon>我都不确定它到底通不通
<11-2,Sheldon>I'm not even sure it makes sense.

271
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,830
<11-3,Amy>别放弃  也许我们能改好
<11-3,Amy>Well, don't give up. Maybe we can fix it.

272
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,570
<11-4,Sheldon>能请你不要这么大声呼吸吗
<11-4,Sheldon>Can you stop breathing so loud?

273
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,100
<11-4,Sheldon>我都能听到你鼻腔中的口哨声了
<11-4,Sheldon>I can hear your nose whistling.

274
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,910
<11-5,Amy>我还能听到你的脸猛讲屁话呢  扯平了
<11-5,Amy>I can hear your face talking, so we're even.

275
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,370
<11-6,Sheldon>够了  赶紧去擤鼻涕
<11-6,Sheldon>All right, either blow your nose

276
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,740
<11-6,Sheldon>要不就教它吹一首《康城赛马》
<11-6,Sheldon>or teach it to play "Camptown Races."

277
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,260
<11-7,Amy>好  好  你想要我擤鼻涕
<11-7,Amy>Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose?

278
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,910
<11-7,Amy>好  我擤了
<11-7,Amy>Here, I'll blow it.

279
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,290
<11-7,Amy>舒服了吧
<11-7,Amy>Better?

280
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,460
<11-8,Sheldon>不行  我还能听到
<11-8,Sheldon>No, I can still hear it.

281
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,710
<11-8,Sheldon>等等  是我发出的  算了别管了
<11-8,Sheldon>Oh, wait, that's me. Never mind, it's fine.

282
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,890
<11-9,Amy>你这个人真烦人
<11-9,Amy>You know, you're exhausting.

283
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,820
<11-9,Amy>我就知道不该跟你一起工作
<11-9,Amy>I knew working together was a bad idea.

284
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,990
<11-10,Sheldon>等一下
<11-10,Sheldon>Hold on.

285
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,770
<11-10,Sheldon>我知道哪里错了
<11-10,Sheldon>I see what's wrong here.

286
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,050
<11-10,Sheldon>我们只传送到了枕叶部分
<11-10,Sheldon>We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe,

287
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,690
<11-10,Sheldon>却忘了前额皮质
<11-10,Sheldon>not to the prefrontal cortex.

288
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,380
<11-11,Amy>那就代表这个延迟参数
<11-11,Amy>That would mean that this delayed parameter

289
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,550
<11-11,Amy>应该再增加250毫秒
<11-11,Amy>should be increased 250 milliseconds.

290
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,480
<11-12,Sheldon>这样才对嘛
<11-12,Sheldon>Oh, that is much better.

291
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,540
<11-12,Sheldon>老弟  如果你的妙计能够像
<11-12,Sheldon>Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way

292
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,860
<11-12,Sheldon>你的鼻涕一样喷薄而出的话  我们就所向无敌了
<11-12,Sheldon>mucus comes out of your nose, we'd be in good shape.

293
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,890
<12-1,Raj>来  喝一小口
<12-1,Raj>Now, take a sip,

294
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,590
<12-1,Raj>在嘴里搅动一下
<12-1,Raj>swirl it around your mouth,

295
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,720
<12-1,Raj>用心去体会它的香气
<12-1,Raj>and try to notice the flavors,

296
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,330
<12-1,Raj>单宁和口感
<12-1,Raj>the tannins, the textures.

297
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,100
<12-1,Raj>如何
<12-1,Raj>Well?

298
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,880
<12-2,Penny>我应该先把口香糖吐出来
<12-2,Penny>I probably should have spit out my gum first.

299
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,790
<12-3,Raj>你知道吗
<12-3,Raj>Yeah. You know,

300
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,960
<12-3,Raj>过去的几周我过得相当艰难
<12-3,Raj>the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough,

301
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,400
<12-3,Raj>但和你们住在一起
<12-3,Raj>but, uh, staying here with you guys

302
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,060
<12-3,Raj>让我的心情总算轻松了一点
<12-3,Raj>has really helped take my mind off of it.

303
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,950
<12-4,Penny>我们也很喜欢你住在这里
<12-4,Penny>Well, we've loved having you around.

304
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,320
<12-4,Penny>对吧  亲爱的
<12-4,Penny>Right, sweetie?

305
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,430
<12-4,Penny>莱纳德
<12-4,Penny>Leonard?

306
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,650
<12-5,Raj>他什么时候走的呀
<12-5,Raj>Yeah, when did he leave?

307
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,210
<12-6,Penny>是啊  真没礼貌
<12-6,Penny>Yeah, that's rude.

308
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,540
<13-1,Leonard>跟你们一起待着感觉真好
<13-1,Leonard>You know, it's nice to spend time with people

309
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,110
<13-1,Leonard>你们才不会把工作当成肥皂剧讨论
<13-1,Leonard>who don't talk about work like it's some kind of soap opera.

310
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,450
<13-2,Bernadette>珍妮佛还在尝试一路"睡"上去吗
<13-2,Bernadette>Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?

311
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,080
<13-3,Leonard>是的
<13-3,Leonard>Yeah.

312
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,210
<13-4,Howard>有人陪佩妮做那些你不喜欢的事
<13-4,Howard>You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny

313
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,560
<13-4,Howard>你应该高兴才对
<13-4,Howard>you don't want to.

314
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,410
<13-5,Bernadette>对呀  我多希望有人来陪着霍华德
<13-5,Bernadette>Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.

315
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,350
<13-5,Bernadette>等等
<13-5,Bernadette>Wait.

316
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,490
<13-6,Howard>什么  我逼你陪我做什么了
<13-6,Howard>What? What do I make you do?

317
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,260
<13-7,Bernadette>我想想  魔术用品店
<13-7,Bernadette>Let's see, the magic store,

318
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,150
<13-7,Bernadette>《神秘博士》动漫会
<13-7,Bernadette>the Doctor Who convention,

319
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,790
<13-7,Bernadette>全国皮带扣收藏家见面会
<13-7,Bernadette>the National Belt Buckle Collector's meet and greet.

320
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,980
<13-8,Howard>邀请函上写得清清楚楚
<13-8,Howard>It said right there on the invitation,

321
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,150
<13-8,Howard>"为快乐扣紧皮带[安全带]"
<13-8,Howard>"Buckle up for fun."

322
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,580
<13-8,Howard>我读时你没听不是我的错
<13-8,Howard>It's not my fault you didn't listen.

323
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,010
<13-9,Leonard>我相信我是反应过度了
<13-9,Leonard>I'm sure I'm overreacting.

324
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,910
<13-10,Bernadette>你有权有自己的感受
<13-10,Bernadette>You're entitled to feel how you feel.

325
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,210
<13-10,Bernadette>如果你不喜欢  你应该和她谈
<13-10,Bernadette>If you don't like it, you should just talk to her.

326
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,510
<13-11,Leonard>我不想让自己像个吃醋的宝宝一样
<13-11,Leonard>I don't want to sound like a jealous baby.

327
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,070
<13-12,Bernadette>那也许你不应该和她谈
<13-12,Bernadette>Oh, then maybe you shouldn't talk to her.

328
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,530
<14-1,Amy>我就感觉
<14-1,Amy>You know, I had a feeling

329
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,240
<14-1,Amy>你用错了计算模型
<14-1,Amy>you were using the wrong computational model,

330
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,860
<14-1,Amy>但我什么也没说  因为你太敏感了
<14-1,Amy>but I didn't say anything 'cause you're so sensitive.

331
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,340
<14-2,Sheldon>就因为光热声味
<14-2,Sheldon>Just because I am easily bothered

332
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,610
<14-2,Sheldon>以及鸟儿看我的样子  很容易让我心烦
<14-2,Sheldon>by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me

333
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,930
<14-2,Sheldon>并不代表我很敏感
<14-2,Sheldon>does not mean I'm sensitive!

334
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,120
<14-3,Amy>如果视觉皮质在看到动作电位时
<14-3,Amy>I wonder what kind of success we'd have

335
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,490
<14-3,Amy>我们便马上明确度量
<14-3,Amy>if we defined measurement as the first moment

336
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,780
<14-3,Amy>我们现在会取得怎样的成功呢
<14-3,Amy>that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.

337
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,230
<14-4,Sheldon>这是大胆又具见解深刻的解决方案
<14-4,Sheldon>That is a daring and insightful solution.

338
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,560
<14-5,Amy>我们终于有进展了
<14-5,Amy>We're finally making progress.

339
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,010
<14-5,Amy>真希望不吵架就能做到就好了
<14-5,Amy>I wish we could do it without fighting.

340
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,310
<14-6,Sheldon>如果吵架是我们获得进展的原因呢
<14-6,Sheldon>What if the fighting is the reason we're making progress?

341
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,640
<14-7,Amy>我想也不是可能
<14-7,Amy>I suppose it's conceivable that

342
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,280
<14-7,Amy>我们体内"战或逃"反应相关的荷尔蒙
<14-7,Amy>the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response

343
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,470
<14-7,Amy>可以令我们的认知过程更敏锐
<14-7,Amy>could be sharpening our cognitive processes.

344
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,030
<14-8,Sheldon>如果是这样的话
<14-8,Sheldon>Well, if that's the case,

345
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,020
<14-8,Sheldon>你阿公阿嬷口齿不清  弯腰驼背老罗锅
<14-8,Sheldon>then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.

346
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,610
<14-9,Amy>你好大的胆子  这样说我的奶奶
<14-9,Amy>How dare you speak that way about my Grammy--

347
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,110
<14-9,Amy>等等  慢着
<14-9,Amy>Hey, wait a second. Wait.

348
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,150
<14-9,Amy>零度以下时 ΔT 可以等于 α
<14-9,Amy>Delta "T" could equal alpha sub-zero.

349
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,340
<14-10,Sheldon>看来我们得做出选择
<14-10,Sheldon>It seems we have a choice to make.

350
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,560
<14-10,Sheldon>以科学的名义  放弃所有基本规则
<14-10,Sheldon>Abandon all ground rules in the name of science,

351
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,390
<14-10,Sheldon>或是为了我们的恋情放弃合作
<14-10,Sheldon>or... give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.

352
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,990
<14-11,Amy>只有一个明确的选择
<14-11,Amy>There's only one clear choice.

353
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,610
<14-13,Amy>-科学  -不是  你这个傻逼
<14-13,Amy>- Science it is. - No, you bonehead!

354
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,300
<14-14,Sheldon>骂人  太好了
<14-14,Sheldon>Name-calling, that is perfect.

355
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,890
<14-14,Sheldon>我在计算这个方程式时
<14-14,Sheldon>Now, when I get to this equation here,

356
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,170
<14-14,Sheldon>尽管痛骂我  知道吗
<14-14,Sheldon>really let me have it. You know?

357
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,920
<14-14,Sheldon>提示下  我穿衣服没啥品味
<14-14,Sheldon>I-If it helps, I'm not the sharpest dresser.

358
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,430
<15-1,Leonard>总之  我知道这样很傻  但拉杰搬来后
<15-1,Leonard>Anyway, I know it's silly, but since Raj moved in,

359
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,660
<15-1,Leonard>我觉得受到了排挤
<15-1,Leonard>I've been feeling a little left out.

360
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,790
<15-2,Penny>亲爱的  你是在说什么疯话
<15-2,Penny>Well, sweetie, that's crazy.

361
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,950
<15-3,Raj>不  佩妮  别无视他的感受
<15-3,Raj>No, no, Penny, don't dismiss his feelings.

362
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,850
<15-4,Leonard>谢谢你  我只是觉得...
<15-4,Leonard>Thank you. I just feel...

363
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,370
<15-5,Raj>等等  我不是说
<15-5,Raj>Hang on, I'm not saying

364
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,770
<15-5,Raj>他的感受不疯狂
<15-5,Raj>that his feelings aren't crazy.

365
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,890
<15-5,Raj>我只是不想让他觉得
<15-5,Raj>I just don't want him to think that

366
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,870
<15-7,Penny>这里不是能安心分享的场所
<15-7,Penny>this isn't a safe place.

367
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,570
<15-6,Leonard>说实话
<15-6,Leonard>Well, to be truthful...

368
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,960
<15-7,Penny>这里为什么会不能安心
<15-7,Penny>Well, why wouldn't this be a safe place? I mean,

369
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,430
<15-7,Penny>他身边有他的老婆和死党之一
<15-7,Penny>he's surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.

370
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,630
<15-8,Raj>我不想乱揣测莱纳德的想法
<15-8,Raj>I don't want to speak for Leonard.

371
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,380
<15-9,Leonard>谢谢你  我...
<15-9,Leonard>Thank you. I...

372
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,370
<15-10,Raj>但当你没安全感时
<15-10,Raj>But when you're insecure,

373
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,020
<15-10,Raj>再多的外部肯定
<15-10,Raj>no amount of external validation

374
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,470
<15-10,Raj>也没法让你觉得安心
<15-10,Raj>can ever make you feel safe.

375
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,610
<15-11,Penny>你说得对
<15-11,Penny>Yeah, you're right.

376
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,170
<15-11,Penny>你对这类的事真的很敏感
<15-11,Penny>You know, you're really sensitive about this kind of stuff.

377
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,510
<15-12,Raj>-我善于倾听  -对
<15-12,Raj>- I'm a good listener. - Yeah.

<15-14,Leonard>Hey, Olsen twins...

379
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,540
<15-15,Penny>怎么了
<15-15,Penny>What?

380
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,820
<15-16,Leonard>我就坐在这里
<15-16,Leonard>Well, I-I mean, I'm sitting right here.

381
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,230
<15-16,Leonard>你们在讨论我的感受
<15-16,Leonard>You're talking about my feelings

382
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,670
<15-16,Leonard>却把我晾在一边不理我
<15-16,Leonard>and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.

383
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,470
<15-17,Raj>对不起  你想说什么
<15-17,Raj>I'm sorry. What did you want to say?

384
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,200
<15-18,Leonard>我不知道  你们差不多都说到了
<15-18,Leonard>I don't know, you pretty much covered it.

385
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,150
<16-1,Sheldon>你读一下好吗
<16-1,Sheldon>Can you read them back?
