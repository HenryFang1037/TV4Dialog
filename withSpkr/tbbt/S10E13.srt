00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,840
<6-5,Raj>《生活大爆炸》前情提要
<6-5,Raj>Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,640
<7-9,Sheldon>别哭了  我求你了
<7-9,Sheldon>Please stop crying. I'm begging you.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,800
<7-10,Leonard>我不知道还有什么招了
<7-10,Leonard>I don't know what else to do.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,040
<7-11,Sheldon>我的奶水都没了
<7-11,Sheldon>My boobs are empty.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,710
<7-12,Amy>你要吃千层面吗
<7-12,Amy>Do you want lasagna?

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,330
<7-13,Leonard>好啦  好啦
<7-13,Leonard>It's okay, it's okay.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
<8-11,Sheldon>我们造了什么孽啊
<8-11,Sheldon>What have we done?

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,470
<1-1,Penny>这些...是怎么回事
<1-1,Penny>What... what's all this?

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,650
<1-2,Leonard>因为你听起来今天挺辛苦的
<1-2,Leonard>Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day,

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,150
<1-2,Leonard>我就想让你回到一个美好的家嘛
<1-2,Leonard>so I wanted you to come home to something nice.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,710
<1-3,Penny>你真是太贴心了
<1-3,Penny>Oh, that is so thoughtful.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,260
<1-4,Leonard>你还记得我们去圣巴巴拉市品酒
<1-4,Leonard>Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,470
<1-4,Leonard>你说这是你喝过最好喝的玫瑰红吗
<1-4,Leonard>and you said that was the best rose you'd ever had?

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,710
<1-5,Penny>我就记得我们开车去那边
<1-5,Penny>Yeah, I remember us driving up there,

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,890
<1-5,Penny>进了酿酒厂  然后...
<1-5,Penny>going to the winery and...

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,910
<1-5,Penny>就断片了
<1-5,Penny>that's it.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,030
<1-6,Leonard>这酒就是你断片的原因啊
<1-6,Leonard>And this wine is why.

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,300
<1-7,Penny>什么东西这么香
<1-7,Penny>Hey, what smells so good?

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,320
<1-8,Leonard>我做了最爱吃的  披萨贝果
<1-8,Leonard>I made your favorite: pizza bagels!

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,220
<1-8,Leonard>玫瑰红酒加披萨贝果
<1-8,Leonard>Pink wine and pizza bagels?

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,320
<1-9,Penny>感觉又重回8年级那会儿了
<1-9,Penny>It's like eighth grade all over again.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,340
<1-9,Penny>有你真幸运
<1-9,Penny>I am so lucky to have you.

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,840
<1-10,Leonard>小心  这个很烫
<1-10,Leonard>Well, now be careful, these are hot.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,610
<1-10,Leonard>虽然我能解释这个的热力学
<1-10,Leonard>I-I could explain the thermodynamics

26
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,980
<1-10,Leonard>就是为什么起司看起来比披萨边烫
<1-10,Leonard>of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust,

27
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,310
<1-10,Leonard>但我决定把解释留在自己心里
<1-10,Leonard>but instead, I'm gonna keep it to myself.

28
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,580
<1-11,Penny>你总是知道什么不该说
<1-11,Penny>You always know what not to say.

29
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,060
<1-11,Penny>我只是不敢相信你布置了这一切
<1-11,Penny>I just, I can't believe you did all this.

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,390
<1-11,Penny>是这样的
<1-11,Penny>Well, you know,

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,350
<1-12,Leonard>相处久了很容易不拿对方当一回事
<1-12,Leonard>it's easy to take each other for granted and

32
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,900
<1-12,Leonard>我永远不想这样对你  因为...
<1-12,Leonard>I never want to do that to you, because

33
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,700
<1-12,Leonard>你的爱
<1-12,Leonard>your love,

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,820
<1-12,Leonard>就像一条河
<1-12,Leonard>it's like a river.

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,140
<1-12,Leonard>平静又深邃
<1-12,Leonard>It's peaceful and deep.

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,680
<1-12,Leonard>你的灵魂  就像个秘密
<1-12,Leonard>Your soul is, it's like a secret

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,920
<1-12,Leonard>我永远也守不住
<1-12,Leonard>that I never could keep.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,110
<1-13,Penny>你居然还引用了超级男孩的歌词
<1-13,Penny>You did not just quote an NSYNC song.

39
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,430
<1-14,Leonard>引用自你最爱的超级男孩歌曲
<1-14,Leonard>I quoted your favorite NSYNC song.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,410
<1-16,Leonard>靠  我打太大一个嗝
<1-16,Leonard>Damn. I burped so hard,

41
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,300
<1-16,Leonard>我在游戏里都死了
<1-16,Leonard>I died in my game.

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,280
<1-16,Leonard>字幕组
<1-16,Leonard>ZiMuZu.tv

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,900
<2-1,Sheldon>莱纳德  我想问你好久
<2-1,Sheldon>Leonard, I've been meaning to ask you:

56
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,440
<2-1,Sheldon>你穿多大的鞋子
<2-1,Sheldon>what size shoe do you wear?

57
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,420
<2-2,Leonard>怎么了
<2-2,Leonard>Why?

58
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,390
<2-3,Sheldon>我在尝试对别人的生活感兴趣
<2-3,Sheldon>I'm trying to take more of an interest in other people's lives.

59
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,490
<2-4,Leonard>那很好啊  我穿八号半的鞋
<2-4,Leonard>That's nice. I wear a size eight and a half.

60
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,700
<2-5,Sheldon>脚好小啊
<2-5,Sheldon>That's small.

61
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,750
<2-5,Sheldon>说说你这周末有没有什么安排吧
<2-5,Sheldon>So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?

62
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,710
<2-6,Leonard>你会取笑我的答案吗
<2-6,Leonard>Are you gonna laugh at the answer?

63
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,480
<2-7,Sheldon>除非你的答案是"去买婴儿鞋"
<2-7,Sheldon>Only if the answer is "Shopping for baby shoes."

64
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,930
<2-8,Leonard>如果你真想知道
<2-8,Leonard>If you must know,

65
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,120
<2-8,Leonard>佩妮公司奖给她去水疗度假村度周末
<2-8,Leonard>Penny won a spa weekend from work

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,210
<2-8,Leonard>她要带我去
<2-8,Leonard>and she's taking me.

67
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,380
<2-9,Sheldon>这还真挺有趣呢
<2-9,Sheldon>Oh, well you know, that is interesting.

68
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,910
<2-9,Sheldon>忍不住想看你会感染哪些东西回家
<2-9,Sheldon>I wonder what kind of infection you'll come home with.

69
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,360
<2-9,Sheldon>我赌真菌感染
<2-9,Sheldon>My money's on fungal.

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,070
<2-9,Sheldon>女生们还在对面办女生之夜
<2-9,Sheldon>They're still having girls' night across the hall.

71
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,980
<2-10,Leonard>那你来我这咱们办男生之夜啊
<2-10,Leonard>Oh, so, hang out with me and we'll have boys' night.

72
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,880
<2-11,Sheldon>我们这年纪了
<2-11,Sheldon>At our age,

73
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,520
<2-11,Sheldon>为什么不称呼为爷们之夜
<2-11,Sheldon>why don't we call it man's night?

74
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,520
<2-12,Leonard>因为我们刚把零花钱都拿去买漫画了
<2-12,Leonard>Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,300
<3-1,Amy>佩妮  你会别扭吗  就是你不住这了
<3-1,Amy>Penny, is it weird that we're having girls' night here,

76
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,400
<3-1,Amy>却在这里办女生之夜
<3-1,Amy>but you don't live here anymore,

77
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,460
<3-1,Amy>所以应该算是我的女生之夜这件事
<3-1,Amy>so it's basically my girls' night?

78
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,760
<3-2,Penny>我还没怎么想过这事
<3-2,Penny>I hadn't really thought about it.

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,450
<3-3,Amy>现在你想了这事而心里开始不舒服了吗
<3-3,Amy>But now you're thinking about it and it bothers you?

80
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,550
<3-3,Amy>我懂
<3-3,Amy>I get that.

81
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,220
<3-4,Bernadette>你跟谢尔顿同居的事情发展如何
<3-4,Bernadette>Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?

82
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,400
<3-5,Amy>好得不能再好
<3-5,Amy>Better than ever.

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,430
<3-5,Amy>他会问我今天如何  对我的生活有兴趣
<3-5,Amy>He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life.

84
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,860
<3-5,Amy>就跟我大学时的男友一样
<3-5,Amy>He's like my boyfriend in college,

85
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,980
<3-5,Amy>唯一差别是他是真人  别人都看得见他
<3-5,Amy>except he's real, so people can see him.

86
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,210
<3-6,Bernadette>我见他许多年了
<3-6,Bernadette>I've been seeing him for years,

87
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,070
<3-6,Bernadette>我到现在还没完全相信他是真人
<3-6,Bernadette>I'm still not convinced he's real.

88
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,000
<3-7,Penny>我能问你个问题吗
<3-7,Penny>Hey, can I ask you a question?

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,330
<3-7,Penny>你已经结婚蛮久了
<3-7,Penny>You've been married for a while.

90
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,680
<3-7,Penny>老公通常都会变得
<3-7,Penny>Is it normal for the husband

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,550
<3-7,Penny>仪式感尽失  啥都不在乎吗
<3-7,Penny>to kind of completely stop giving a crap?

92
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,990
<3-8,Bernadette>不妙  发生什么啦
<3-8,Bernadette>Uh-oh, what's going on?

93
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,640
<3-9,Penny>莱纳德以前会为我做很多事情
<3-9,Penny>Well, Leonard used to do all these things,

94
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,250
<3-9,Penny>比如给我买花
<3-9,Penny>like bring me flowers

95
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,870
<3-9,Penny>或者穿裤子
<3-9,Penny>and wear pants.

96
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,030
<3-10,Bernadette>没什么啊  华仔从来不穿裤子
<3-10,Bernadette>It's okay, Howie never has on pants.

97
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,240
<3-10,Bernadette>披萨店外送员现在都这么送过来
<3-10,Bernadette>The Domino's guy brings the pizza like this now.

98
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,960
<3-11,Amy>谢尔顿总是穿着裤子
<3-11,Amy>Well, Sheldon always has his pants on.

99
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,150
<3-11,Amy>辨认嫌疑犯的话  我都没法从膝盖认出他
<3-11,Amy>I don't think I could pick his knees out of a lineup.

100
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,040
<3-12,Penny>不只是穿不穿裤子的问题
<3-12,Penny>Well, it's not just the pants.

101
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,110
<3-12,Penny>只是自打我们结婚以后
<3-12,Penny>Just, it's like since we got married,

102
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,150
<3-12,Penny>他就不再对我花心思了
<3-12,Penny>he doesn't really try anymore.

103
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,770
<3-13,Amy>佩妮
<3-13,Amy>Uh, Penny?

104
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,560
<3-13,Amy>我不知道怎么跟你开口
<3-13,Amy>I don't know how to say this,

105
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,630
<3-13,Amy>但这是我第一次主办女生之夜
<3-13,Amy>but this is my first girls' night

106
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,230
<3-13,Amy>而你却扫了大伙儿的兴
<3-13,Amy>and you're kind of bumming everybody out.

107
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,950
<4-1,Howard>好了  终于把哈雷哄睡了
<4-1,Howard>All right, got Halley to sleep.

108
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,640
<4-2,Raj>我从婴儿监视器里听见了
<4-2,Raj>Yeah, I heard you on the baby monitor.

109
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,850
<4-2,Raj>真想不到你可以把《行尸走肉》的主题曲
<4-2,Raj>Didn't think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead

110
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,030
<4-2,Raj>改成摇篮曲
<4-2,Raj>into a lullaby.

111
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,190
<4-3,Howard>是啊  必须得让她喜欢上看电视
<4-3,Howard>Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV,

112
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,550
<4-3,Howard>不然以后她就会让我陪她去室外玩
<4-3,Howard>or someday, she'll want me to play outside.

113
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,580
<4-3,Howard>天啊  地板不平老吱吱响
<4-3,Howard>Boy, that floor is so squeaky.

114
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,450
<4-3,Howard>我还挺惊讶自己走出房间时没把她吵醒
<4-3,Howard>I'm surprised I didn't wake her up walking out of the room.

115
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,530
<4-4,Raj>你有没有试过修一修
<4-4,Raj>Have you tried anything to fix it?

116
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,010
<4-5,Howard>我铺了地毯
<4-5,Howard>Well, I put the rug down.

117
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,030
<4-5,Howard>但不管用
<4-5,Howard>It didn't help.

118
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,590
<4-6,Raj>我知道  蓝色粗毛地毯  你是怎么想的
<4-6,Raj>I know. Blue shag. What were you thinking?

119
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,210
<4-7,Howard>也试过拿钉子钉住地板
<4-7,Howard>Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.

120
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,600
<4-8,Raj>效果怎么样
<4-8,Raj>Did that do anything?

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,110
<4-9,Howard>就在地板上留了几个小洞
<4-9,Howard>Yeah, it left little holes in the floor,

122
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,660
<4-9,Howard>所以我才买地毯盖住啊
<4-9,Howard>that's why I bought the rug.

123
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,790
<5-1,Sheldon>如果你那么下  我八步之内就能赢你
<5-1,Sheldon>If you do that, I'll win in eight moves.

124
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,700
<5-1,Sheldon>我五步之内就能赢你
<5-1,Sheldon>I'll win in five moves.

125
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,870
<5-1,Sheldon>我一步之内就能赢你
<5-1,Sheldon>I'll win in one move.

126
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,410
<5-2,Leonard>我输了  比赛很精彩
<5-2,Leonard>Oh, no. Good game.

127
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,990
<5-4,Leonard>佩妮  我在试图
<5-4,Leonard>Oh, Penny, I'm trying

128
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,950
<5-5,Sheldon>对别人的生活感兴趣
<5-5,Sheldon>to take an interest in other people.

129
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,940
<5-5,Sheldon>你的女生之夜怎么样呀
<5-5,Sheldon>Uh, how was your girls' night?

130
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,370
<5-6,Penny>还行
<5-6,Penny>Oh, it was fine.

131
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,320
<5-7,Sheldon>你吃了什么呀
<5-7,Sheldon>Did you have anything to eat?

132
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,170
<5-8,Penny>薯片
<5-8,Penny>Uh, chips.

133
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,080
<5-9,Sheldon>喝了什么呀
<5-9,Sheldon>Anything to drink?

134
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,860
<5-10,Penny>喝了点红酒
<5-10,Penny>Some wine.

135
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,380
<5-11,Sheldon>就像对着窗帘打网球  都没点反弹
<5-11,Sheldon>Well, I'm just playing tennis against the drapes here.

136
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,470
<5-12,Leonard>别搭理他
<5-12,Leonard>Just ignore him.

137
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,620
<5-13,Penny>至少人家有兴趣问
<5-13,Penny>At least he took an interest.

138
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,670
<5-14,Leonard>这话什么意思
<5-14,Leonard>What's that supposed to mean?

139
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,740
<5-15,Penny>没意思
<5-15,Penny>Nothing.

140
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,390
<5-16,Leonard>你这是闹哪出
<5-16,Leonard>Hey, what's going on with you?

141
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,780
<5-17,Penny>我不想说这事
<5-17,Penny>I don't want to talk about it.

142
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,090
<5-18,Leonard>别这样嘛  快告诉我
<5-18,Leonard>Well, hey, come on, just tell me.

143
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,610
<5-18,Leonard>好吧
<5-18,Leonard>Fine.

144
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,500
<5-19,Penny>最近我有点觉得
<5-19,Penny>Lately, I kind of feel like

145
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,840
<5-19,Penny>你不拿我当回事了
<5-19,Penny>you've been taking me for granted.

146
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,770
<5-20,Leonard>什么  此话怎讲
<5-20,Leonard>Wh-what? Where is this coming from?

147
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,010
<5-21,Sheldon>莱纳德  她可能喝醉了
<5-21,Sheldon>Leonard. She might be drunk.

148
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,390
<5-21,Sheldon>毕竟她就吃了点薯片
<5-21,Sheldon>All she had was chips.

149
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,910
<5-22,Penny>自打我们结婚以后  你貌似就认为
<5-22,Penny>It's just, since we got married you seem to think

150
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,170
<5-22,Penny>不用对我花心思了
<5-22,Penny>you don't have to try anymore.

151
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,730
<5-23,Leonard>简直是无稽之谈
<5-23,Leonard>That is ridiculous.

152
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,240
<5-24,Penny>我就知道会这样  所以我才不想跟你谈
<5-24,Penny>This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about it.

153
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,950
<5-25,Leonard>别别别  那我们就来谈一谈
<5-25,Leonard>No, No, no, no. Let's talk about it.

154
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,520
<5-25,Leonard>我才是那个打从第一天
<5-25,Leonard>I'm the one who's made all the effort

155
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,280
<5-25,Leonard>就对这份感情尽心尽力的人
<5-25,Leonard>in this relationship since day one.

156
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,770
<5-25,Leonard>麻烦告诉我  我还要做到什么程度
<5-25,Leonard>Please tell me what more I could do.

157
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,710
<5-26,Penny>好  那算了  或许我该带艾米
<5-26,Penny>Okay. You know what? Maybe I'll take Amy with me

158
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,800
<5-26,Penny>这周末跟我一起去水疗度假村
<5-26,Penny>to the spa this weekend instead.

159
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,740
<5-27,Leonard>行啊  去吧
<5-27,Leonard>Fine, go ahead.

160
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,160
<5-28,Sheldon>艾米有空
<5-28,Sheldon>Amy is free.

161
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,030
<5-28,Sheldon>她本来周六要上竖琴课
<5-28,Sheldon>She had a harp lesson on Saturday,

162
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,250
<5-28,Sheldon>但后来取消了
<5-28,Sheldon>but it got canceled...

163
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,150
<5-28,Sheldon>天啊  一旦对别人感兴趣
<5-28,Sheldon>Boy, when you take an interest in people,

164
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,630
<5-28,Sheldon>你真是打开了废话的话匣子
<5-28,Sheldon>you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,220
<6-1,Bernadette (on phone)>好的  谢谢老爸
<6-1,Bernadette (on phone)>Okay. Thanks, Daddy.

166
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,130
<6-1,Bernadette (on phone)>他说全面修复像这样旧地板的唯一办法
<6-1,Bernadette (on phone)>He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that

167
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,340
<6-1,Bernadette (on phone)>就是全拆了换新的
<6-1,Bernadette (on phone)>is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.

168
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,460
<6-2,Howard>-听起来得花不少钱呢  -且慢
<6-2,Howard>- That sounds expensive. - Hang on.

169
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,670
<6-3,Raj>我不是质疑她父亲
<6-3,Raj>No offense to her father,

170
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,040
<6-3,Raj>但他毕竟不是麻省理工毕业的工程师
<6-3,Raj>but he's not an MIT-trained engineer.

171
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,850
<6-3,Raj>你的强项就是动脑和动手啊
<6-3,Raj>Thinking and building is what you do.

172
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,300
<6-4,Howard>麻省理工的校训是"手脑并用"
<6-4,Howard>MIT's motto is "Mind and hand,"

173
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,330
<6-4,Howard>恰好也是我寂寞青少年时期的自慰箴言
<6-4,Howard>which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.

174
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,600
<6-5,Raj>来嘛  我们只需发散创新思维
<6-5,Raj>Oh, come on. We just need to be more creative.

175
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,150
<6-5,Raj>假设你的双脚完全不用碰到地板呢
<6-5,Raj>What if you didn't step on the floor at all?

176
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,480
<6-5,Raj>比如说  假设你...
<6-5,Raj>Like, what if you...

177
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,900
<6-5,Raj>从天花板拴根绳子荡过去
<6-5,Raj>swung on a rope from the ceiling?

178
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,540
<6-6,Howard>不行
<6-6,Howard>No.

179
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,140
<6-7,Raj>好吧
<6-7,Raj>Okay. Um...

180
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,360
<6-7,Raj>那好  假设你安装一个皮带轮装置
<6-7,Raj>Okay. What if you rig up a pulley system

181
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,820
<6-7,Raj>穿上套索缓缓穿过房间呢
<6-7,Raj>and move yourself across the room in a harness?

182
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,070
<6-8,Howard>不行
<6-8,Howard>No.

183
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,850
<6-9,Bernadette>我有个主意
<6-9,Bernadette>I have one.

184
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,560
<6-9,Bernadette>假设你用一个巨型弹弓
<6-9,Bernadette>What if you got a giant slingshot

185
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,000
<6-9,Bernadette>然后冲着墙壁用力弹进去
<6-9,Bernadette>and flung yourself into the wall?

186
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,540
<6-10,Howard>-你是在说笑话吗  -等等
<6-10,Howard>- Is that supposed to be funny? - Hold on.

187
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,150
<6-11,Raj>没错  是挺好笑的
<6-11,Raj>Yeah, that's funny.

188
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,930
<7-1,Penny>好了  我们要出发了
<7-1,Penny>All right, we're heading out.

189
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,000
<7-3,Amy>我们到了酒店就打给你
<7-3,Amy>I'll call you when we get to the hotel.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,470
<7-4,Sheldon>如果有那种小瓶子装的洗发水
<7-4,Sheldon>And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?

191
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,840
<7-5,Amy>我会带回家  让你展示给我看
<7-5,Amy>I will bring them home so you can show me

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,960
<7-5,Amy>哥斯拉怎么洗澡
<7-5,Amy>how Godzilla takes a shower.

193
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,840
<7-6,Leonard>-好好玩  -谢谢
<7-6,Leonard>- Have fun. - Thanks.

194
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,730
<7-7,Penny>可以走了吧
<7-7,Penny>Are you ready?

195
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,640
<7-8,Amy>再见  谢尔顿
<7-8,Amy>Bye, Sheldon.

196
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,410
<7-9,Sheldon>算了  我觉得这样不好
<7-9,Sheldon>You know what? I feel uncomfortable

197
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,270
<7-9,Sheldon>当众在这种时候秀恩爱
<7-9,Sheldon>engaging in a public display of affection

198
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,070
<7-9,Sheldon>他们俩还在闹别扭呢
<7-9,Sheldon>while their relationship is strained.

199
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,530
<7-10,Leonard>尽管秀吧  我无所谓
<7-10,Leonard>Go ahead, it's fine.

200
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,640
<7-11,Sheldon>-再见  -再见
<7-11,Sheldon>- Bye. - Bye.

201
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,450
<7-11,Sheldon>-够了  -赶紧走
<7-11,Sheldon>- Okay! - Let's go!

202
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,290
<7-11,Sheldon>-再见  -再见
<7-11,Sheldon>- Bye. - Bye.

203
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,390
<7-17,Amy>我会想你的
<7-17,Amy>I'll miss you.

204
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,830
<7-18,Sheldon>我也会想你的
<7-18,Sheldon>Yeah, I'll miss you, too.

205
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,740
<7-19,Amy>我的思念绝对胜过你
<7-19,Amy>I'll miss you more.

206
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,750
<7-20,Sheldon>如果你的思念等于X
<7-20,Sheldon>Well, if X equals the amount that you'll miss me,

207
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,240
<7-20,Sheldon>我的思念就等于X+1
<7-20,Sheldon>then I'll miss you X plus one.

208
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,780
<7-21,Amy>如果你的思念等于X+1
<7-21,Amy>If you miss me X plus one, I'll miss you

209
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,050
<7-21,Amy>我的思念就等于（X+1）  然后...
<7-21,Amy>open paren X plus one, close paren to the second...

210
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,000
<7-22,Leonard>谢了
<7-22,Leonard>Thank you.

211
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,580
<7-22,Leonard>给你
<7-22,Leonard>Here.

212
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,780
<8-1,Sheldon>你很难过  所以我帮你泡了茶
<8-1,Sheldon>You're sad, so I made you tea.

213
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,850
<8-2,Leonard>谢谢
<8-2,Leonard>Thanks.

214
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,520
<8-3,Sheldon>按你喜欢的口味泡的哟
<8-3,Sheldon>And it's just the way you like it.

215
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,730
<8-4,Leonard>-伯爵茶  -是的
<8-4,Leonard>- Earl Grey? - Yes.

216
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,690
<8-6,Leonard>-加了蜂蜜  -是的
<8-6,Leonard>- Honey? - Yes.

217
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,680
<8-8,Leonard>-不甜的杏仁  -老天爷
<8-8,Leonard>- Unsweetened almond- - Good Lord!

218
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,840
<8-9,Sheldon>我不辞辛苦泡了茶  哪来那么多废话
<8-9,Sheldon>I made you tea. Just drink it!

219
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,160
<8-10,Leonard>抱歉  谢谢你
<8-10,Leonard>Sorry, thank you.

220
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,990
<8-11,Sheldon>我们做点什么让你开心的事吧
<8-11,Sheldon>Well, what can we do to cheer you up?

221
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,380
<8-12,Leonard>我不知道该做什么
<8-12,Leonard>I really don't know.

222
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,960
<8-13,Sheldon>你想玩层层叠吗
<8-13,Sheldon>You want to play Jenga?

223
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,550
<8-13,Sheldon>或者车票之旅[桌游]
<8-13,Sheldon>Or, uh, Ticket to Ride?

224
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,470
<8-13,Sheldon>《炉石传说》
<8-13,Sheldon>Hearthstone?

225
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,220
<8-13,Sheldon>什么游戏是你输了以后最开心的
<8-13,Sheldon>I-- what would you be the happiest losing at?

226
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,500
<8-14,Leonard>我不想玩游戏  谢尔顿
<8-14,Leonard>I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.

227
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,860
<8-15,Sheldon>我可记得你以前特别喜欢跟我一起玩游戏呢
<8-15,Sheldon>Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me.

228
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,300
<8-15,Sheldon>看来你敷衍了事的感情不止跟佩妮这段
<8-15,Sheldon>Maybe Penny isn't the only relationship you're phoning in.

229
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,320
<8-16,Leonard>不是我不再对她花心思
<8-16,Leonard>It's not that I'd stopped trying,

230
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,010
<8-16,Leonard>是感情本来就是这样
<8-16,Leonard>it's just how relationships progress.

231
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,670
<8-16,Leonard>一开始迷恋  忘情投入
<8-16,Leonard>They start with infatuation,

232
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,140
<8-16,Leonard>但久而久之  激情会蜕变成更为舒服的相处模式
<8-16,Leonard>but over time mellow into something more comfortable.

233
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
<8-16,Leonard>你说得对
<8-16,Leonard>Yeah, you're right.

234
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,920
<8-17,Sheldon>就像我人生初识勾股定理一样
<8-17,Sheldon>It's like when I first encountered the Pythagorean Theorem.

235
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,480
<8-17,Sheldon>我被斜边边长的平方等于
<8-17,Sheldon>You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse

236
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,090
<8-17,Sheldon>对边边长平方和迷得神魂颠倒
<8-17,Sheldon>was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides.

237
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,460
<8-17,Sheldon>但现在我对它的感觉只是  切
<8-17,Sheldon>Yeah, but now I'm just like "Eh."

238
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,910
<9-1,Howard>这些格子代表了整个房间
<9-1,Howard>Okay, this grid represents the room.

239
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,480
<9-1,Howard>我们只需找出哪些格子会吱吱响
<9-1,Howard>All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is

240
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,830
<9-1,Howard>从而发现一条通向摇篮的安静之路
<9-1,Howard>and we can find a quiet path to the crib.

241
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,480
<9-2,Raj>这看起来好像《龙与地下城》的地图
<9-2,Raj>It looks like a map from Dungeons & Dragons.

242
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,850
<9-3,Howard>不同的是摇篮里装的是满级的造粪小怪兽
<9-3,Howard>Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.

243
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,080
<9-4,Raj>你负责检查吱吱声
<9-4,Raj>Okay, uh, you check for squeaks,

244
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,870
<9-4,Raj>我负责记录
<9-4,Raj>and I will mark them down.

245
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,920
<9-4,Raj>好的
<9-4,Raj>Okay.

246
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,040
<9-5,Howard>A3号格子  开始测试
<9-5,Howard>Space A-3, here we go.

247
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,530
<9-5,Howard>响得厉害  记下来
<9-5,Howard>It's squeaking. Mark it.

248
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,290
<9-6,Raj>你的女儿要在你成长过的房间里茁壮长大
<9-6,Raj>It's nice to think that you grew up in this room

249
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,630
<9-6,Raj>想想真是挺温馨的
<9-6,Raj>and now your daughter's going to as well.

250
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,350
<9-7,Howard>我希望她在这享受到的性爱与我一样多
<9-7,Howard>I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did.

251
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,200
<9-7,Howard>也就是没有  下一个格子
<9-7,Howard>None. Next square.

252
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,420
<9-8,Raj>你为什么要在空中抖动双手
<9-8,Raj>Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?

253
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,750
<9-9,Howard>这是我们犹太人的习俗
<9-9,Howard>It's a tradition of my people.

254
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,770
<9-9,Howard>* 如果我是个大土豪 *
<9-9,Howard>* If I were a rich man *

255
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,700
<9-10,Raj>以后别再唱《物质女孩》了
<9-10,Raj>"Material Girl" needs to be retired.

256
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,790
<9-10,Raj>你下次唱K就该唱这歌
<9-10,Raj>That is your karaoke song.

257
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,240
<10-1,Sheldon>你想玩我发明的驾驶游戏吗
<10-1,Sheldon>Would you like to play a driving game I invented?

258
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,140
<10-2,Leonard>是有关我和佩妮失败的感情吗
<10-2,Leonard>Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?

259
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,900
<10-3,Sheldon>算了
<10-3,Sheldon>Never mind.

260
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,860
<10-3,Sheldon>佩妮为了躲开你才去水疗度假村
<10-3,Sheldon>You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you.

261
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,690
<10-3,Sheldon>你确定你应该去找她吗
<10-3,Sheldon>Are you sure you should be going there?

262
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,640
<10-4,Leonard>我不想再等两天才解决这件事
<10-4,Leonard>I don't want to wait two days for us to work this out.

263
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,290
<10-4,Leonard>很好
<10-4,Leonard>Very well.

264
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,910
<10-5,Sheldon>你俩当初结婚就是一时冲动
<10-5,Sheldon>You got married spur of the moment.

265
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,190
<10-5,Sheldon>离婚的方式如出一辙也没啥不可
<10-5,Sheldon>I don't see why your divorce should be any different.

266
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,940
<10-6,Leonard>我真想靠边停车一脚踢你出去
<10-6,Leonard>I would pull this car over and kick you out,

267
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,950
<10-6,Leonard>可如果佩妮甩了我  你就是我的唯一依靠了
<10-6,Leonard>but... if Penny dumps me, you're all I got.

268
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,110
<11-1,Penny>你上一次做按摩是什么时候
<11-1,Penny>When was the last time you got a massage?

269
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,950
<11-2,Amy>两周前谢尔顿曾经站在我背上
<11-2,Amy>Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago,

270
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,990
<11-2,Amy>但那是因为他枕头上有蜘蛛
<11-2,Amy>but that was just 'cause there was a spider on his pillow

271
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,180
<11-2,Amy>他想躲开
<11-2,Amy>and he was trying to get away.

272
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,630
<11-3,Penny>莱纳德也曾经站在我背上过
<11-3,Penny>Leonard stood on me once, too,

273
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,110
<11-3,Penny>他当时是为了站高点看新年玫瑰花车大游行
<11-3,Penny>but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.

274
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,550
<11-4,Amy>我不太了解这里的规矩
<11-4,Amy>I don't know the protocol,

275
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,750
<11-4,Amy>你按摩时会裸体吗
<11-4,Amy>are you gonna be naked for your massage?

276
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,920
<11-5,Penny>会啊
<11-5,Penny>Well. Yeah.

277
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,840
<11-6,Amy>那我可能穿太多衣服了
<11-6,Amy>Then this is probably too many clothes.

278
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,950
<11-8,Penny>你来干什么
<11-8,Penny>What are you doing here?

279
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,330
<11-9,Leonard>我是来道歉的
<11-9,Leonard>I came here to apologize.

280
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,860
<11-10,Penny>莱纳德  我很感激你这么做
<11-10,Penny>Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that,

281
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,180
<11-10,Penny>但我需要一点自己的时间
<11-10,Penny>but I need a little time to myself.

282
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,770
<11-11,Leonard>我搞不懂了
<11-11,Leonard>Okay. I don't get it.

283
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,320
<11-11,Leonard>明明是你叫我要努力的
<11-11,Leonard>You said make an effort.

284
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,380
<11-11,Leonard>现在我来努力了啊
<11-11,Leonard>Here I am, making an effort.

285
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,700
<11-12,Sheldon>艾米  你好呀
<11-12,Sheldon>Hello, Amy. It's nice to see you.

286
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,760
<11-13,Amy>你也好呀
<11-13,Amy>Nice to see you, too.

287
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,540
<11-14,Sheldon>这就是怎么让努力  看起来不会太用力
<11-14,Sheldon>And that's how you make effort look effortless.

288
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,770
<11-15,Penny>好了  麻烦你先回去
<11-15,Penny>All right. Can you please just go

289
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,810
<11-15,Penny>我们明天再说好吗
<11-15,Penny>and we'll talk about this tomorrow?

290
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,950
<11-16,Leonard>我不懂你到底想要什么
<11-16,Leonard>I don't understand what you want!

291
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,470
<11-17,Penny>我自己也想知道
<11-17,Penny>I'm trying to figure it out!

292
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,780
<11-18,Sheldon>知道吗  如果你希望
<11-18,Sheldon>You know what? If you'd like,

293
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,370
<11-18,Sheldon>我可以很快草拟一个《感情协议》
<11-18,Sheldon>I could whip up a quick Relationship Agreement.

294
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,890
<11-18,Sheldon>反正我在水疗度假村
<11-18,Sheldon>Well, I'm at a spa,

295
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,420
<11-18,Sheldon>不妨做一些放松的事
<11-18,Sheldon>might as well do something relaxing.

296
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,450
<11-19,Amy>谢尔顿  让他们单独聊聊
<11-19,Amy>Sheldon, why don't we give them some privacy?

297
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,970
<11-20,Sheldon>好的
<11-20,Sheldon>Very well.

298
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,430
<11-20,Sheldon>等一下  我们看看迷你酒柜有什么东西
<11-20,Sheldon>Hey. Later, we'll check out the minibar?

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,850
<11-20,Sheldon>我让你见识下哥斯拉是怎么喝醉的
<11-20,Sheldon>I'll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.

300
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,660
<12-1,Howard>我们给整间房做了地图标记
<12-1,Howard>So what we did was map out the entire room

301
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,610
<12-1,Howard>确定了所有吱吱声的所在
<12-1,Howard>to identify every squeak.

302
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,080
<12-3,Howard>看着  一旦你掌握了就很简单了
<12-3,Howard>Watch. It's easy, once you get the hang of it.

303
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,130
<12-3,Howard>跨步
<12-3,Howard>Step.

304
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,150
<12-3,Howard>跨步
<12-3,Howard>Step.

305
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,600
<12-3,Howard>跳上脚凳
<12-3,Howard>Hop onto ottoman.

306
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,070
<12-2,Raj>不要只穿着袜子跳  我差点摔断脖子
<12-2,Raj>Don't do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.

307
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,580
<12-3,Howard>然后坐下
<12-3,Howard>Then simply sit,

308
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,860
<12-3,Howard>旋转  站起
<12-3,Howard>spin, stand,

309
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,610
<12-3,Howard>跨一大步
<12-3,Howard>stretch...

310
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,070
<12-3,Howard>也许要把裤子松一松
<12-3,Howard>Maybe unloosen your pants.

311
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,630
<12-3,Howard>然后  并腿
<12-3,Howard>And... step,

312
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,310
<12-3,Howard>抓床  略微转身
<12-3,Howard>grab, tiny pivot,

313
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,590
<12-3,Howard>用力一拉  到了
<12-3,Howard>pull, and you're there.

314
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,500
<12-3,Howard>易如反掌  小菜...
<12-3,Howard>Easy, peasy, mac and...

315
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,680
<12-3,Howard>你懂我意思
<12-3,Howard>You get the idea.

316
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,280
<12-4,Bernadette>你们真指望我在黑暗中
<12-4,Bernadette>You actually expect me to do this

317
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,670
<12-4,Bernadette>抱着宝宝这样做吗
<12-4,Bernadette>while holding a baby in the dark?

318
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,540
<12-4,Bernadette>稍等
<12-4,Bernadette>Hold on...

319
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,690
<12-5,Raj>我觉得她没有被感动到
<12-5,Raj>I don't think she was impressed.

320
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,110
<12-6,Howard>我有更大的问题
<12-6,Howard>Bigger problems.

321
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,010
<12-6,Howard>感觉这有东西炸了
<12-6,Howard>I felt something pop.

322
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,500
<13-1,Sheldon>我的水里有黄瓜
<13-1,Sheldon>There's a cucumber in my water.

323
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,890
<13-3,Sheldon>他们知道这事吗
<13-3,Sheldon>Do they know it's there?

324
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,900
<13-3,Sheldon>还是我该跟谁反映
<13-3,Sheldon>Um, sh-should I tell somebody?

325
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,710
<13-4,Amy>是故意放进去的
<13-4,Amy>It's there on purpose.

326
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,060
<13-4,Amy>使味道更清爽
<13-4,Amy>It's refreshing.

327
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,880
<13-5,Sheldon>有意思
<13-5,Sheldon>Interesting.

<13-5,Sheldon>两者放在一起  我去
<13-5,Sheldon>But you put 'em together, and bleh.

<13-8,Sheldon>太好了  你们来了  你们还在吵架吗
<13-8,Sheldon>Oh! Good, you're here. Are you still fighting?

<13-8,Sheldon>如果你们离婚了  我可以在两家过两次圣诞吗
<13-8,Sheldon>If you get divorced, do I get two Christmases?

333
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,420
<13-9,Penny>我们不会离婚
<13-9,Penny>We're not getting divorced.

334
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,250
<13-10,Leonard>听着  我们意识到
<13-10,Leonard>Listen, we realized, that, uh...

<13-10,Leonard>作为夫妻  我们面临了新的挑战

<13-11,Penny>we need to stay on top of.

338
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,690
<13-11,Penny>所以我们觉得这样做也许有帮助
<13-11,Penny>So we thought it would useful--

339
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,490
<13-11,Penny>真不敢相信我会说这样的话
<13-11,Penny>and I can't believe I am about to say this--

<13-12,Leonard>明白吗  我们不需要标明各自上厕所的时间

343
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,870
<13-13,Penny>不过限制下他从厕所发短信给我
<13-13,Penny>Although a rule about him texting me from in there

344
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,680
<13-13,Penny>也许对浪漫有帮助
<13-13,Penny>might help with the romance.
