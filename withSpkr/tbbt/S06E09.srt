1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,570
<1-1,Leonard>他们不一样
<1-1,Leonard>They are not.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,280
<1-2,Raj>就一样
<1-2,Raj>They are, too.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,410
<1-3,Leonard>种种数据显示  你的假设完全不能成立
<1-3,Leonard>Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,430
<1-3,Leonard>现在纯粹是你的智商在死鸭子嘴硬
<1-3,Leonard>You're just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,740
<1-4,Raj>是你正表现出对谈话主题的
<1-4,Raj>No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,780
<1-4,Raj>高度无知
<1-4,Raj>of the subject matter.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,330
<1-4,Raj>木乃伊与僵尸是一模一样的东西
<1-4,Raj>Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,630
<1-5,Leonard>是吗
<1-5,Leonard>Oh, yeah?

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,670
<1-5,Leonard>木乃伊全身裹着绷带呢
<1-5,Leonard>Mummies are wrapped in bandages.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,310
<1-6,Raj>那是人家的时尚风格
<1-6,Raj>That's called a fashion choice.

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,180
<1-7,Leonard>好吧  是你自己自讨苦吃
<1-7,Leonard>All right, you brought this on yourself.

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,080
<1-7,Leonard>谢尔顿  说死丫的
<1-7,Leonard>Sheldon, get him.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,930
<1-8,Sheldon>如果你被僵尸咬了
<1-8,Sheldon>If a zombie bites you,

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,450
<1-8,Sheldon>你也会变为僵尸
<1-8,Sheldon>you turn into a zombie.

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,270
<1-8,Sheldon>但如果是木乃伊咬你
<1-8,Sheldon>However, if a mummy bites you,

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,150
<1-8,Sheldon>你只会变成有木乃伊咬痕的白痴
<1-8,Sheldon>all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite.

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,270
<1-8,Sheldon>所以你就像是个
<1-8,Sheldon>So, like a zombie,

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,730
<1-8,Sheldon>被人啃掉下半身的僵尸一样
<1-8,Sheldon>that's been eaten from the waist down,

19
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,390
<1-8,Sheldon>说的话完全"站不住脚"
<1-8,Sheldon>you, sir, have no leg to stand on.

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,990
<1-9,Leonard>真乖  赏你个饼干
<1-9,Leonard>Good boy. Here's a cookie.

21
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,670
<1-10,Sheldon>谢谢
<1-10,Sheldon>Oh, thank you.

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,250
<1-11,Howard>大家伙在干嘛呢
<1-11,Howard>Hey, fellas, what's going on?

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,940
<1-12,Leonard>又在辩木乃伊跟僵尸呢
<1-12,Leonard>Mummies and zombies again.

24
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,430
<1-13,Howard>他们不一样好吗
<1-13,Howard>Oh, they're not the same thing.

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,230
<1-14,Leonard>也赏你个饼干
<1-14,Leonard>You get a cookie, too.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,700
<1-14,Leonard>谢谢
<1-14,Leonard>Thanks.

27
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,010
<1-15,Howard>你们猜谁今早弄了台新车
<1-15,Howard>Guess who picked up his new car this morning?

28
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,300
<1-16,Raj>恭喜你啊
<1-16,Raj>Congratulations.

29
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,410
<1-16,Raj>-里面有新车味吗  -有的
<1-16,Raj>- Does it have that new car smell? - Yep!

30
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,810
<1-17,Howard>只要不让我妈上车就有
<1-17,Howard>For as long as I can keep my mother out of it.

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,110
<1-17,Howard>你们想看一下的话
<1-17,Howard>If you want to check it out later,

32
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,580
<1-17,Howard>就停在外面哦  294号位
<1-17,Howard>it's parked right out front, space 294.

33
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,960
<1-18,Sheldon>等等  294号位吗
<1-18,Sheldon>I'm sorry-- 294?

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,220
<1-20,Sheldon>-是的  -那是我的停车位
<1-20,Sheldon>- Yeah. - That's my parking spot.

35
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,540
<1-21,Raj>你怎么会有个停车位
<1-21,Raj>Why do you have a parking spot?

36
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,830
<1-21,Raj>你都没车  你连车都不开
<1-21,Raj>You don't have a car. You don't even drive.

37
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,920
<1-22,Sheldon>那无关紧要
<1-22,Sheldon>It doesn't matter.

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,610
<1-22,Sheldon>那停车位是我的
<1-22,Sheldon>That's my spot.

39
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,880
<1-23,Leonard>可能是看你从不停车  就重分配给人了吧
<1-23,Leonard>Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,550
<1-24,Sheldon>我也从不用我的乳头啊
<1-24,Sheldon>Well, I'm not using my nipples, either.

41
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,550
<1-24,Sheldon>他们也要帮我重分配吗
<1-24,Sheldon>Maybe they should reassign those.

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,280
<1-25,Howard>谢尔顿  哪天你买车了
<1-25,Howard>Sheldon, someday, if you get a car,

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
<1-25,Howard>他们肯定还会再给你个停车位的
<1-25,Howard>I'm sure they'll give you another parking space.

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,800
<1-25,Howard>我不要别的停车位
<1-25,Howard>I don't want another parking space.

45
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,040
<1-25,Howard>我要我那个停车位
<1-25,Howard>I want my parking space.

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,060
<1-26,Sheldon>那可是完美车位
<1-26,Sheldon>It's perfect.

47
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,610
<1-26,Sheldon>那车位是在角落
<1-26,Sheldon>It's a corner spot,

48
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,470
<1-26,Sheldon>车门被旁车门撞凹的机率少了一半
<1-26,Sheldon>cutting the risk of door-dings in half.

49
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,840
<1-26,Sheldon>而走到楼入口处也只需仅仅28步
<1-26,Sheldon>It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance.

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,370
<1-26,Sheldon>旁边的树能在热天提供遮阴
<1-26,Sheldon>The nearby tree provides shade on hot days

51
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,390
<1-26,Sheldon>而且那树还是一只可爱小松鼠的家
<1-26,Sheldon>and is also home to a delightful squirrel.

52
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,510
<1-26,Sheldon>这很难得呢
<1-26,Sheldon>Which is fortuitous

53
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,890
<1-26,Sheldon>毕竟大多数的松鼠都是讨厌鬼
<1-26,Sheldon>because most squirrels are real jerks.

54
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,910
<1-27,Howard>故事虽好
<1-27,Howard>Fun story.

55
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,200
<1-27,Howard>但你就是没车啊
<1-27,Howard>Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.

56
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,890
<1-28,Sheldon>别想转移话题
<1-28,Sheldon>Don't try to change the subject.

57
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,270
<1-28,Sheldon>我们是在谈停车位
<1-28,Sheldon>This is about a parking space.

58
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,430
<1-28,Sheldon>跟有没有车毫无关系
<1-28,Sheldon>It has nothing to do with cars.

59
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,720
<1-29,Howard>你有听到你自己说的话了吗
<1-29,Howard>Are you listening to yourself?

60
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,120
<1-30,Sheldon>我当然都有听啊
<1-30,Sheldon>I always listen to myself.

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,300
<1-30,Sheldon>这是我人生中最美好的事之一呢
<1-30,Sheldon>It's one of the great joys of my life.

62
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,060
<1-30,Sheldon>快把你的车开离我的宝位
<1-30,Sheldon>Now, get your car out of my spot.

63
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,220
<1-31,Howard>不要
<1-31,Howard>Nope.

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,390
<1-32,Sheldon>你不仁
<1-32,Sheldon>Very well.

65
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,550
<1-32,Sheldon>那就别怪我不义了
<1-32,Sheldon>You leave me no choice.

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,170
<2-1,Sheldon>看个屁啊  你个白痴松鼠
<2-1,Sheldon>What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?

67
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,980
<2-1,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<2-1,Sheldon>第六季  第九集

68
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,090
<2-1,Sheldon>塞伯特校长  请听我的理由
<2-1,Sheldon>President Siebert, listen to reason.

69
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,380
<2-1,Sheldon>我知道我没有在使用那个停车位
<2-1,Sheldon>Yeah, I understand I don't use the parking spot,

70
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,890
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>但这不是重点  我...
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>but that's not the point. I...

71
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,390
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我知道你说过别打去你家
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Yes, I'm aware you told me not to call you at home.

72
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,430
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>但这是因为你不应门啊
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>But you didn't answer the door!

73
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,120
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我知道你在家
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>And I know you were there,

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,490
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我当时从信件投递口看到你在里面了
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>because I saw you through the mail slot.

75
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,950
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>你这话够掉身份啊
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Well, that's some salty language.

76
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,900
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>您别忘了您重点大学校长的身份啊
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>May I remind you that you're the president of a major university,

77
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,690
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>而不是个脏话俱乐部的主席
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>not the president of the Potty Mouth Club.

78
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,130
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>你又说
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>There it is again.

79
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,760
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>你也是用那张嘴亲你母亲的吗
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?

80
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,050
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>好吧  请节哀顺变
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Oh, well, I'm sorry for your loss.

81
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,850
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>晚安
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Oh...! Good night, sir.

82
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,900
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>太扯了
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Unbelievable.

83
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,190
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>他说我的停车位给沃罗威茨不为过
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>He says Wolowitz deserves my spot

84
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,030
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>因为他是学校的重要资产
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>because he's a high-profile asset to the university.

85
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,110
<3-2,Leonard>他也没说错啊
<3-2,Leonard>Well, he's not wrong.

86
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,350
<3-2,Leonard>霍华德好歹也上过国际太空站了
<3-2,Leonard>Howard did go to the International Space Station.

87
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,230
<3-3,Sheldon>那都是五周前的事了
<3-3,Sheldon>Yeah, that was five weeks ago.

88
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,570
<3-3,Sheldon>他还想靠那件事占便宜多久啊
<3-3,Sheldon>How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?

89
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,960
<3-4,Leonard>算了啦  谢尔顿
<3-4,Leonard>Sheldon, let it go.

90
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,980
<3-4,Leonard>也不是什么大事
<3-4,Leonard>It's not a big deal.

91
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,400
<3-5,Sheldon>莱纳德  不反抗只会令他更予取予求
<3-5,Sheldon>No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard.

92
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,190
<3-5,Sheldon>先是占了我停车位
<3-5,Sheldon>It starts with a parking space.

93
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,240
<3-5,Sheldon>食髓知味了以后呢
<3-5,Sheldon>Where does it end?

94
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,860
<3-5,Sheldon>就像我爸说过的一样
<3-5,Sheldon>It's like my dad always said,

95
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,970
<3-5,Sheldon>"一开始只说不能酒后开车
<3-5,Sheldon>"First they say you can't drink and drive.

96
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,790
<3-5,Sheldon>才刚同意  就立刻再进一步说
<3-5,Sheldon>Next thing you know, you can't let your 10-year-old

97
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,040
<3-5,Sheldon>不许让10岁儿子开车  而自己去后座睡觉"
<3-5,Sheldon>take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat."

98
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,670
<3-6,Leonard>你这故事只让我更心疼你妈
<3-6,Leonard>All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.

99
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,690
<3-7,Sheldon>莱纳德  你是我最好的朋友
<3-7,Sheldon>Leonard, you're my best friend.

100
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,070
<3-7,Sheldon>为什么你从不跟我同一阵线
<3-7,Sheldon>Why don't you ever take my side?

101
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,440
<3-8,Leonard>因为我从没懂过你那阵线
<3-8,Leonard>Because I can never understand your side!

102
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,210
<4-1,Howard>还我
<4-1,Howard>Give it back.

103
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,540
<4-1,Howard>很抱歉
<4-1,Howard>I'm sorry,

104
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,070
<4-2,Sheldon>您是指...
<4-2,Sheldon>but could you be more specific?

105
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,390
<4-2,Sheldon>我的钢铁侠头盔
<4-2,Sheldon>My Iron Man helmet.

106
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,290
<4-3,Howard>库萨帕里看见你拿了  还回来
<4-3,Howard>Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.

107
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,510
<4-4,Sheldon>哦  那个啊
<4-4,Sheldon>Oh, that.

108
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,790
<4-4,Sheldon>听我说  这东西我想要
<4-4,Sheldon>Well, see, I wanted it,

109
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,410
<4-4,Sheldon>你又不用  我就拿了
<4-4,Sheldon>and you weren't using it.

110
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,720
<4-4,Sheldon>我们现在生活规则好像是这样哦
<4-4,Sheldon>Apparently, those are the rules we live by now.

111
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,690
<4-4,Sheldon>报复
<4-4,Sheldon>Payback--

112
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,930
<4-4,Sheldon>还真是让人想骂脏话  不是吗
<4-4,Sheldon>it truly is the B word, isn't it?

113
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,630
<4-5,Howard>谢尔顿  那可是价值500美元的限量珍藏品
<4-5,Howard>Sheldon, that is a $500 limited edition collectible,

114
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,750
<4-5,Howard>快还给我
<4-5,Howard>and I want it back.

115
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,230
<4-6,Sheldon>我也想还给你  但很遗憾的是
<4-6,Sheldon>I'd love to help you out, but unfortunately,

116
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,440
<4-6,Sheldon>我在用呢
<4-6,Sheldon>I'm using it.

117
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,330
<4-7,Howard>好吧
<4-7,Howard>Fine.

118
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,450
<4-7,Howard>那我把你的学位证拿走
<4-7,Howard>I'm taking your diploma.

119
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,210
<4-8,Sheldon>尽管拿
<4-8,Sheldon>Go ahead.

120
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,550
<4-8,Sheldon>你这辈子唯一"拿到"博士学位的机会哦
<4-8,Sheldon>That's the only doctorate you'll ever get.

121
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,200
<4-8,Sheldon>里面闻起来怪怪的
<4-8,Sheldon>It smells funny in here.

122
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,890
<5-1,Bernadette>我们真以你为傲  艾米
<5-1,Bernadette>We're so proud of you, Amy.

123
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,040
<5-1,Bernadette>-你的初次比基尼蜜蜡脱毛呢  -对啊
<5-1,Bernadette>- Your first bikini wax. - Yeah.

124
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,820
<5-2,Penny>感觉如何
<5-2,Penny>So, how you doing?

125
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,240
<5-3,Amy>有点小敏感  但还好
<5-3,Amy>A little sensitive, but not bad.

126
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,250
<5-3,Amy>一般都需要这么长时间的吗
<5-3,Amy>Does it always take that long?

127
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,830
<5-4,Penny>不  他们一般不需要跑去多拿点蜜蜡
<5-4,Penny>Uh, no, they usually don't have to go out and get more wax.

128
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,080
<5-5,Amy>除完我感觉都轻了5磅
<5-5,Amy>I feel like I'm five pounds lighter.

129
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,410
<5-6,Bernadette>真的吗  你确定只有5磅吗
<5-6,Bernadette>Really? Only five?

130
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,890
<5-7,Penny>谁想来一杯
<5-7,Penny>Hey, anybody want a drink?

131
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,560
<5-8,Amy>-好的  -当然
<5-8,Amy>- Okay. - Sure.

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,870
<5-9,Bernadette>你昨晚是不是也得听他
<5-9,Bernadette>So, did you spend last night hearing

133
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,010
<5-9,Bernadette>抱怨那场白痴的停车位大战
<5-9,Bernadette>about this silly parking space fight, too?

134
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,150
<5-10,Amy>抱怨了好几小时
<5-10,Amy>For hours.

135
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,870
<5-10,Amy>幸好  因为谢尔顿戴着那个白痴面具
<5-10,Amy>Fortunately, I couldn't understand most of it

136
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,210
<5-10,Amy>他说的话我大部分都听不懂
<5-10,Amy>'cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.

137
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,210
<5-11,Bernadette>霍华德气得要死
<5-11,Bernadette>Howard was so angry

138
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,090
<5-11,Bernadette>我不得不把过敏药混在他的冰淇淋里
<5-11,Bernadette>I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream

139
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,310
<5-11,Bernadette>Benadryl是儿童抗过敏药
<5-11,Bernadette>一般小朋友吃了都会想睡觉

140
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,310
<5-11,Bernadette>才能让他消停睡觉
<5-11,Bernadette>to get him to fall asleep.

141
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,240
<5-12,Amy>我猜这就是我们
<5-12,Amy>I guess this is what we get

142
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,180
<5-12,Amy>跟两个荷尔蒙爆棚的雄性霸主在一起的后果
<5-12,Amy>for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males.

143
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,460
<5-12,Amy>一山不容二虎
<5-12,Amy>At some point,

144
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,300
<5-12,Amy>他们总有一天得角斗分生死
<5-12,Amy>they're bound to lock horns.

145
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,010
<5-13,Penny>我猜你说的"角"  是他们从动漫展
<5-13,Penny>I'm assuming these are some kind of horns

146
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,000
<5-13,Penny>买的什么号"角"之类吧
<5-13,Penny>they bought at Comic-Con?

147
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,520
<5-14,Bernadette>我很抱歉学校收回谢尔顿的车位
<5-14,Bernadette>I'm really sorry they took Sheldon's spot away.

148
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,570
<5-14,Bernadette>他不该因为霍华德
<5-14,Bernadette>He shouldn't have to suffer

149
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,090
<5-14,Bernadette>现在是个大咖  而蒙受苦难啊
<5-14,Bernadette>just because Howard's such a big deal now.

150
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,970
<5-15,Amy>是啊  谢尔顿应该大度点
<5-15,Amy>I know, Sheldon should just let Howard

151
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,270
<5-15,Amy>也让霍华德有一次受瞩目的短暂机会
<5-15,Amy>have his little moment in the sun.

152
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,080
<5-16,Bernadette>你这话什么意思
<5-16,Bernadette>What's that supposed to mean?

153
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,740
<5-17,Amy>霍华德这辈子不会再上太空了
<5-17,Amy>Well, Howard's never gonna go to space again,

154
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,500
<5-17,Amy>但谢尔顿一辈子都会是个天才
<5-17,Amy>but Sheldon will always be a genius.

155
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,170
<5-17,Amy>有道理
<5-17,Amy>You're right.

156
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,890
<5-18,Bernadette>谢尔顿肯定有机会重获个好车位啊
<5-18,Bernadette>And I'm sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again,

157
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,620
<5-18,Bernadette>假设他哪天真对科学做了有价值的贡献就行
<5-18,Bernadette>if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.

158
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,430
<5-19,Amy>假设与哪天吗
<5-19,Amy>If and when?

159
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,190
<5-20,Penny>好了  或许我们该换个话题
<5-20,Penny>Okay, maybe we should change the subject.

160
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,700
<5-20,Penny>艾米  你"小妹妹"那里感觉如何
<5-20,Penny>Amy, how are your lady parts?

161
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,420
<5-20,Penny>还凉飕飕的吗
<5-20,Penny>Still chilly down there?

162
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,740
<5-21,Bernadette>打住
<5-21,Bernadette>Hang on.

163
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,030
<5-21,Bernadette>谢尔顿所有的理论
<5-21,Bernadette>None of Sheldon's theories

164
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,980
<5-21,Bernadette>都未获得最终证实
<5-21,Bernadette>have ever been definitively proven.

165
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,670
<5-21,Bernadette>而我的老公可是真正上过太空
<5-21,Bernadette>My husband actually went to outer space.

166
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,820
<5-22,Amy>那的确是一项令人赞叹的成就
<5-22,Amy>That's an impressive accomplishment.

167
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,050
<5-22,Amy>他现在成功鼓舞了百万美国人
<5-22,Amy>He's now an inspiration to millions of Americans

168
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,300
<5-22,Amy>就算你不特别  甚至不够格
<5-22,Amy>who know you don't have to be special

169
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,820
<5-22,Amy>也都可以登上外太空
<5-22,Amy>or even qualified to go into space.

170
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
<5-23,Penny>我还记得我第一次尝试比基尼脱毛
<5-23,Penny>You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax.

171
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,790
<5-23,Penny>我姐姐是用熔化的蜡笔和胶带帮我
<5-23,Penny>My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape.

172
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,770
<5-23,Penny>那主意蠢透了...
<5-23,Penny>It's a bad idea...

173
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,730
<5-24,Bernadette>天啊  艾米
<5-24,Bernadette>Gosh, Amy.

174
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,530
<5-24,Bernadette>我感觉到了一丝敌意啊
<5-24,Bernadette>I'm sensing a little hostility.

175
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,710
<5-24,Bernadette>是不是因为  你们的性生活
<5-24,Bernadette>Is it maybe because, like Sheldon's work,

176
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,560
<5-24,Bernadette>跟谢尔顿的研究一样纯属"理论"啊
<5-24,Bernadette>your sex life is also theoretical?

177
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,160
<5-25,Penny>毒啊
<5-25,Penny>Damn.

178
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,920
<5-26,Amy>是啊  至少等我们开搞了后
<5-26,Amy>Yeah, well, at least when we do make love,

179
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,210
<5-26,Amy>谢尔顿脑子里不会想着他妈妈
<5-26,Amy>Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother.

180
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,940
<5-26,Amy>没错  我就是在明嘲暗讽
<5-26,Amy>And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference

181
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,110
<5-26,Amy>霍华德他这辈子痴迷着想
<5-26,Amy>to Howard's lifelong obsession

182
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,940
<5-26,Amy>爬回他妈宽敞无比的子宫的心里
<5-26,Amy>to crawl back into her spacious womb.

183
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,220
<5-27,Penny>时至今日  我一看见蜡笔
<5-27,Penny>Anyway, to this day, I still can't see

184
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,000
<5-27,Penny>还是会吓得赶紧夹紧双腿
<5-27,Penny>a box of crayons without crossing my legs.

185
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,010
<5-28,Bernadette>我没必要听你冷嘲热讽
<5-28,Bernadette>I don't have to take this.

186
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,960
<5-28,Bernadette>老娘现在就回家跟我的老公做爱
<5-28,Bernadette>I'm gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now.

187
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,080
<5-28,Bernadette>可能还让他干我"停车位"呢
<5-28,Bernadette>Maybe I'll let him do it to me in the parking spot.

188
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,190
<5-28,Bernadette>虽然听起来很淫荡  但我不是那个意思
<5-28,Bernadette>Which sounds dirty, but I didn't mean it that way!

189
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,370
<6-1,Raj>好吧  另外一个问题
<6-1,Raj>Okay, here's another one

190
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,650
<6-1,Raj>如果僵尸咬了吸血鬼
<6-1,Raj>If a zombie bites a vampire,

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,780
<6-1,Raj>然后吸血鬼咬了人类
<6-1,Raj>and the vampire bites a human,

192
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,630
<6-1,Raj>那那个人类会变成吸血鬼  还是僵尸
<6-1,Raj>does the human become a vampire or a zombie?

193
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,560
<6-1,Raj>或是僵血鬼
<6-1,Raj>Or a zompire?

194
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,200
<6-2,Leonard>谢尔顿
<6-2,Leonard>Sheldon?

195
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,350
<6-3,Sheldon>饼干拿来
<6-3,Sheldon>Cookie.

196
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,930
<6-4,Leonard>我没有
<6-4,Leonard>I don't have any.

197
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,020
<6-5,Sheldon>我才不无偿帮你
<6-5,Sheldon>Well, I'm not giving it away.

198
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,350
<6-6,Howard>你好呀  谢尔顿
<6-6,Howard>Hi, Sheldon.

199
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,470
<6-7,Sheldon>他坐在我的专位上
<6-7,Sheldon>He's in my spot.

200
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,310
<6-7,Sheldon>莱纳德  让他别裸体坐在我的专位上
<6-7,Sheldon>Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.

201
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,570
<6-8,Leonard>霍华德  你这是干嘛
<6-8,Leonard>Howard, what are you doing?

202
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,390
<9-3,Sheldon>他又没在坐
<9-3,Sheldon>He wasn't using it.

203
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,300
<6-9,Howard>而我刚好需要一块冰凉的皮革
<6-9,Howard>And I needed a nice cool piece of leather

204
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,160
<6-9,Howard>来[摩]擦我的光屁屁
<6-9,Howard>to wiggle my naked ass on.

205
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,520
<6-10,Sheldon>快滚开
<6-10,Sheldon>Get off there.

206
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,000
<6-11,Howard>把我的钢铁侠头盔还给我
<6-11,Howard>Give me back my Iron Man helmet.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,620
<6-12,Sheldon>把我的停车位还给我
<6-12,Sheldon>Give me back my parking space.

208
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,310
<6-13,Howard>你又不需要停车位
<6-13,Howard>You don't need a parking space.

209
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,110
<6-13,Howard>你连车都没有
<6-13,Howard>You don't have a car.

210
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,830
<6-14,Sheldon>你又不需要钢铁侠头盔
<6-14,Sheldon>You don't need an Iron Man helmet.

211
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,720
<6-14,Sheldon>你又不是钢铁侠
<6-14,Sheldon>You're not Iron Man.

212
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,530
<6-15,Howard>看来我们陷入僵局了
<6-15,Howard>Well, we appear to have reached an impasse.

213
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,440
<6-15,Howard>不过我得说  我原以为
<6-15,Howard>And you know, I have to say, I thought

214
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,890
<6-15,Howard>把你笔记本放我的大雕上  你会更生气呢
<6-15,Howard>you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.

215
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,320
<6-16,Raj>我刚还没发现  这招不赖啊
<6-16,Raj>I didn't pick up on that. That's a nice touch.

217
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,130
<7-1,Amy>人家好激动
<7-1,Amy>This is so exciting.

218
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,580
<7-1,Amy>都感觉有点刺痛了
<7-1,Amy>I'm feeling all tingly.

219
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,520
<7-1,Amy>但也有可能是因为
<7-1,Amy>Although that could just be

220
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,730
<7-1,Amy>我才把比基尼部位除了毛哦
<7-1,Amy>my newly defoliated bikini zone.

221
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,740
<7-2,Sheldon>把好风
<7-2,Sheldon>Keep a lookout.

222
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,410
<7-2,Sheldon>这地方有一大堆校园保安
<7-2,Sheldon>This place is swarming with campus security.

223
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,990
<7-2,Sheldon>他们会骂死我们的
<7-2,Sheldon>They will not hesitate to scold us.

224
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,510
<7-3,Amy>死猪头
<7-3,Amy>Freaking pigs.

226
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,330
<7-3,Amy>爽啊
<7-3,Amy>Oh, yeah.

227
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,400
<7-4,Sheldon>好的  现在
<7-4,Sheldon>Okay, now,

228
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,740
<7-4,Sheldon>把你的车开进来  我们就可以走人了
<7-4,Sheldon>pull your car into the spot and let's get out of here.

229
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,420
<7-5,Amy>等等  我得把车留在这里吗
<7-5,Amy>Wait, I'm leaving my car here?

230
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,950
<7-6,Sheldon>对  记得拉手刹
<7-6,Sheldon>Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake.

231
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,410
<7-6,Sheldon>这样要拖走你车都得废很大劲
<7-6,Sheldon>Really makes these things tough to budge.

232
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,260
<7-7,Amy>在我停车以前  你到后座来一下
<7-7,Amy>Before I park, come in the backseat.

233
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,830
<7-7,Amy>我给你看看我今天做的事
<7-7,Amy>I want to show you something I had done today.

234
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,360
<7-8,Sheldon>好啊  我都好奇起来了
<7-8,Sheldon>All right, color me intrigued.

235
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,480
<7-9,Amy>你觉得怎么样
<7-9,Amy>What do you think?

236
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,080
<7-10,Sheldon>你喷漆味吸高  嗨过头了吧
<7-10,Sheldon>I think you're high on paint fumes.

237
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,780
<7-10,Sheldon>老天  好多创口贴啊
<7-10,Sheldon>And boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.

238
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,480
<8-1,Penny>你每一张结婚照里都有霍华德的妈妈
<8-1,Penny>Okay, Howard's mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.

239
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,990
<8-2,Bernadette>我能说什么呢  她可是"大"姑娘
<8-2,Bernadette>What can I tell ya? She's a big girl.

240
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,740
<8-2,Bernadette>不管看哪  她都赫然在目
<8-2,Bernadette>Wherever you look, there she is.

241
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,040
<8-2,Bernadette>再来点咖啡吗
<8-2,Bernadette>More coffee?

242
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,910
<8-3,Penny>不了  莱纳德要带我去听物理讲座
<8-3,Penny>No, Leonard's taking me to a physics lecture,

243
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,310
<8-3,Penny>咖啡会害让我睡不着
<8-3,Penny>and coffee'll just keep me awake.

244
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,070
<8-3,Penny>我去开门
<8-3,Penny>Oh, I'll get it.

245
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,110
<8-4,Amy>看来某人和伯纳黛特是一队的啊
<8-4,Amy>Oh, looks like someone's on Team Bernadette.

246
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,100
<8-4,Amy>霍华德在哪
<8-4,Amy>Where's Howard?

247
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,500
<8-5,Bernadette>他不在  怎么了
<8-5,Bernadette>He's not here. What's wrong?

248
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,770
<8-5,Bernadette>他让我的车被拖走了
<8-5,Bernadette>He had my car towed.

249
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,130
<8-6,Amy>花了我200美元才弄回来
<8-6,Amy>It cost me $200 to get it back.

250
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,520
<8-7,Bernadette>这么惨啊
<8-7,Bernadette>Oh, no.

251
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,540
<8-7,Bernadette>车本来在哪停着的呢
<8-7,Bernadette>Where was it parked?

252
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,510
<8-8,Amy>在谢尔顿的停车位
<8-8,Amy>In Sheldon's spot.

253
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,610
<8-9,Bernadette>不对啊  谢尔顿没有车位
<8-9,Bernadette>That doesn't make sense. Sheldon doesn't have a spot.

254
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,610
<8-9,Bernadette>是不是在霍华德的车位呀
<8-9,Bernadette>Was it maybe in Howard's spot?

255
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,590
<8-10,Amy>别装傻了  丫头
<8-10,Amy>Don't play dumb with me, sister.

<8-10,Amy>告诉你丈夫  他欠我200块
<8-10,Amy>You tell your husband he owes me $200.

257
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,390
<8-11,Bernadette>这也说不通啊
<8-11,Bernadette>Well, that doesn't make sense, either.

258
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,640
<8-12,Amy>怎么会
<8-12,Amy>Why not?

259
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,370
<8-13,Bernadette>因为车是我拖走的
<8-13,Bernadette>Because I'm the one who had it towed.

260
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,030
<8-14,Amy>你

273
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,580
<8-27,Bernadette>艾米  你不觉得这事有点失控吗
<8-27,Bernadette>Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?

274
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,480
<8-28,Penny>老天  你才觉得吗
<8-28,Penny>Gee, you think?!

<9-3,Sheldon>我正在使用
<9-3,Sheldon>I'm using it.

<9-18,Howard>他无法接受现在
<9-18,Howard>He can't handle the fact that

321

<9-18,Howard>我比他还大咖的事实
<9-18,Howard>I'm a bigger deal than he is now.

<9-19,Sheldon>也许你不知道这些
<9-19,Sheldon>Maybe you missed that news while you were

330
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,850
<9-19,Sheldon>因为当时你像个傻子一样在太空里瞎飘

333
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,040
<9-21,Leonard>我不相信你居然想碾死他
<9-21,Leonard>What I don't believe is that you tried to run him over.

334
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,120
<9-22,Howard>别装得好像你没想过这么做一样
<9-22,Howard>Oh, like you've never thought of doing that.

<10-4,Howard>Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started,

351
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,930
<10-4,Howard>我不知道你是个如此疯狂的混...
<10-4,Howard>I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard...
