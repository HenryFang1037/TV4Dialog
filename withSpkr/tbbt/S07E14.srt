67
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,180
<2-21,Penny>而且是有别于20分钟前的那种可怜
<2-21,Penny>And in a different way than it was 20 minutes ago.

68
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,770
<2-22,Sheldon>我们浪费大把时间制作绿巨人服装  现在全打水漂了
<2-22,Sheldon>I can't believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.

69
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,600
<2-23,Penny>你们本来全打算打扮成绿巨人啊
<2-23,Penny>You were all going as the Hulk?

72
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,550
<2-25,Raj>本来我们会是化装舞会上的一群
<2-25,Raj>We would have been the angry green belles

73
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,900
<2-25,Raj>愤怒绿色佳人呢
<2-25,Raj>of the masquerade ball.

<2-26,All>Yeah.

75
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,810
<2-27,Penny>现在又变回第一种"可怜"了
<2-27,Penny>And we're back to the first kind of sad.

76
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,470
<3-1,Sheldon>先生们  我有方法解决动漫展问题了
<3-1,Sheldon>Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem.

77
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,230
<3-1,Sheldon>忘了那个破展吧
<3-1,Sheldon>We don't need them.

78
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,680
<3-1,Sheldon>我要自己办一个动漫展
<3-1,Sheldon>I'm starting my own convention.

79
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,110
<3-2,Leonard>谢尔顿  就跟我们一起去买黄牛票嘛
<3-2,Leonard>Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.

80
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,690
<3-3,Sheldon>我告诉你  买黄牛票是违反大会规定的
<3-3,Sheldon>I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules.

81
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,220
<3-3,Sheldon>如被发现  终身不得再参与动漫展
<3-3,Sheldon>If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life.

82
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,650
<3-3,Sheldon>终身啊  莱纳德
<3-3,Sheldon>Life, Leonard.

83
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,980
<3-3,Sheldon>想想等我们80岁  你载我去参加动漫展
<3-3,Sheldon>You're gonna feel pretty silly when we're 80 years old,

84
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,920
<3-3,Sheldon>可你进不去  得在车上等我三天时
<3-3,Sheldon>and you have to drive me down there

85
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,060
<3-3,Sheldon>你就会懊恼自己现在的决定
<3-3,Sheldon>and then wait in the car for three days.

86
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,040
<3-4,Leonard>随便你
<3-4,Leonard>Do what you want.

87
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,550
<3-4,Leonard>我们要去买黄牛票
<3-4,Leonard>We're getting scalped tickets.

88
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,790
<3-5,Howard>我已经在网上找到一个愿意卖的人了
<3-5,Howard>Oh, I already found a guy online who's willing to sell.

89
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,300
<3-6,Sheldon>你怎么知道这不是动漫展警察
<3-6,Sheldon>How do you know this isn't a sting operation

90
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,280
<3-6,Sheldon>布下的钓鱼计划呢
<3-6,Sheldon>set up by the Comic-Con police?

91
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,360
<3-7,Leonard>就跟我知道
<3-7,Leonard>The same way I know

92
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,530
<3-7,Leonard>电视机里的人看不到我一样
<3-7,Leonard>that the people in the TV set can't see me.

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,430
<3-8,Howard>谢尔顿  你随大流嘛
<3-8,Howard>Sheldon, just come with us.

94
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,630
<3-8,Howard>你怎么自己搞一个动漫展啊
<3-8,Howard>You're not gonna make your own convention.

95
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,840
<3-9,Sheldon>你们知道曾几何时
<3-9,Sheldon>You know, there was a time

96
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,900
<3-9,Sheldon>在世上还没有动漫展之前
<3-9,Sheldon>when Comic-Con didn't exist at all

97
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,620
<3-9,Sheldon>也是一位有理想的孤独梦想家打造起来的
<3-9,Sheldon>until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen.

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,030
<3-9,Sheldon>你们听好了
<3-9,Sheldon>And you mark my words--

99
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,520
<3-9,Sheldon>我就是要去山寨他
<3-9,Sheldon>I'm gonna rip that guy off.

100
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,630
<3-9,Sheldon>是的  我要自己打造一个动漫展
<3-9,Sheldon>Yes, I'm starting my own comic book convention,

101
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,660
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我觉得你的客户  小罗伯特·唐尼[钢铁侠]
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr.,

102
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,910
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>会是我们第一个访谈节目的完美出席嘉宾
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>would be perfect to appear on our first panel.

103
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,990
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>为什么你现在就拒绝了呢
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Oh, well, now, why are you saying "no"?

104
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,270
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>你都还没问过他本人意见呢
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>You haven't even asked him yet.

105
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,510
<2-20,Sheldon>不好意思啊
<2-20,Sheldon>You know, excuse me,

106
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,170
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>但我当年耐着性子看完了《钢铁侠2》
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>but I sat through Iron Man 2.

107
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,210
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>他该抽出两个小时的时间  就当还给我
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>I believe he owes me two hours of his time.

108
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,970
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>他们居然挂我电话
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>They hung up on me.

109
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,390
<4-2,Leonard>你没有告诉他们  你的动漫展
<4-2,Leonard>Did you tell them that you're holding your convention

110
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,480
<4-2,Leonard>是在老牌连锁餐厅举办
<4-2,Leonard>at a Marie Callender's,

112
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,710
<4-2,Leonard>每一个受邀嘉宾能获得一块免费的派饼
<4-2,Leonard>and that every panelist gets a free slice of pie?

113
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,550
<4-3,Sheldon>我都还没来得及说呢
<4-3,Sheldon>I didn't even get to that part.

114
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,420
<4-4,Leonard>就连你的朋友威尔·惠顿都觉得
<4-4,Leonard>Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks

115
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,920
<4-4,Leonard>这是在浪费时间
<4-4,Leonard>this is a waste of time.

116
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,470
<4-5,Sheldon>才不是呢
<4-5,Sheldon>Not true.

117
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,330
<4-5,Sheldon>威尔觉得这是个很棒的主意
<4-5,Sheldon>Wil thinks this is a great idea.

118
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,950
<4-5,Sheldon>他只是担心
<4-5,Sheldon>He was just concerned that

119
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,400
<4-5,Sheldon>自己的名气不够大
<4-5,Sheldon>he wasn't a big enough celebrity

120
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,530
<4-5,Sheldon>无法担任如此重大活动的主打来宾
<4-5,Sheldon>to headline such an amazing event.

121
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,340
<4-5,Sheldon>而且那天他要洗胡子  抽不开身
<4-5,Sheldon>Also, that's the same day that he shampoos his beard.

122
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,550
<4-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  兄弟  我真心觉得
<4-6,Leonard>Sheldon, buddy, I just don't think

123
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,310
<4-6,Leonard>你名单上的人是请不到的
<4-6,Leonard>this is going to come together for you.

124
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,910
<4-6,Leonard>你懂个屁
<4-6,Leonard>You don't know that.

125
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,820
<4-7,Sheldon>这名单上还有几个一定会来的人
<4-7,Sheldon>I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.

126
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,330
<4-8,Leonard>-那祝你好运  -先别走
<4-8,Leonard>- Good luck. - No, wait.

127
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,070
<4-9,Sheldon>我要你帮我打电话给斯坦·李  伦纳德·尼莫伊
<4-9,Sheldon>I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy

128
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,610
<4-9,Sheldon>还有《比尔教科学》节目的比尔
<4-9,Sheldon>and Bill Nye the Science Guy...

129
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,580
<4-9,Sheldon>因为从法律上来说  我是禁止接触他们的
<4-9,Sheldon>'cause, legally, I'm not allowed to.

130
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,820
<4-9,Sheldon>对了  还有凯莉·费雪
<4-9,Sheldon>Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher,

131
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,330
<4-9,Sheldon>《星球大战》中饰演莱娅公主的女星
<4-9,Sheldon>后来沉迷毒品和酒精  还一度患上躁郁症

132
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,330
<4-9,Sheldon>因为我听说她是个疯婆子
<4-9,Sheldon>you know, 'cause I hear she can be pretty nuts.

133
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,860
<5-1,Penny>我真不敢相信莱纳德
<5-1,Penny>I can't believe Leonard is

134
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,200
<5-1,Penny>居然花好几百块去买一张黄牛票
<5-1,Penny>spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets.

135
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,210
<5-2,Amy>上周  你也花这么多钱去买一条小裙子啊
<5-2,Amy>Last week, you spent that on a little dress.

136
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,520
<5-3,Penny>但黄牛票只能让动漫展为他敞开大门
<5-3,Penny>Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con.

137
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,590
<5-3,Penny>而那裙子能让任何地方为我敞开大门
<5-3,Penny>That dress gets me into anywhere I want.

138
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,160
<5-4,Bernadette>那些黄牛票的确很贵
<5-4,Bernadette>Those tickets were pretty expensive.

139
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,640
<5-4,Bernadette>我只好让华仔预支他的零用钱
<5-4,Bernadette>I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance.

140
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,750
<5-4,Bernadette>这下他一定舍不得放开在动漫展买的玩具
<5-4,Bernadette>Now he's never gonna put his toys away.

141
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,230
<5-5,Amy>为什么他们不能像谢尔顿一样明智
<5-5,Amy>Why can't they do something sensible like Sheldon

142
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,970
<5-5,Amy>举办自己的动漫展呢
<5-5,Amy>and start their own comic book convention?

143
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,960
<5-5,Amy>好吧  谁想把我扔出去窗外
<5-5,Amy>Also, who wants to throw me out that window?

144
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,900
<5-6,Bernadette>当他们表现得像个小屁孩时
<5-6,Bernadette>Oh, while they're acting like teenagers,

145
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,410
<5-6,Bernadette>我们应该做点大人做的事
<5-6,Bernadette>we could do something grown-up.

146
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,200
<5-7,Amy>你是说去博物馆吗
<5-7,Amy>Oh. You mean like a museum?

147
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,060
<5-8,Penny>对  就像去博物馆那种  但不是
<5-8,Penny>Yes, like a museum, but anything else.

148
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,770
<5-9,Bernadette>我知道这附近有一个不错的酒店
<5-9,Bernadette>Oh, I know. There's a nice hotel not far from here

149
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,490
<5-9,Bernadette>那里可以喝下午茶
<5-9,Bernadette>where they do afternoon tea.

150
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,200
<5-10,Amy>下午茶  好高端洋气上档次啊
<5-10,Amy>Ooh, afternoon tea-- how sophisticated of us.

151
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,700
<5-11,Penny>好吧  如果我们要去高档场所
<5-11,Penny>Oh, all right, if we're gonna be fancy,

152
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,340
<5-11,Penny>那我最好穿上干净的内衣裤
<5-11,Penny>I should probably put on clean underwear.

153
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,700
<5-12,Bernadette>哎哟哟
<5-12,Bernadette>La-dee-da!

154
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,160
<5-12,Bernadette>某人居然还有干净的内衣裤
<5-12,Bernadette>Look who has clean underwear.

155
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,230
<5-13,Penny>我没有  所以路上得去超市一趟
<5-13,Penny>No, we're gonna stop at Target on the way.

156
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,270
<6-1,Raj>既然谢尔顿不去参加动漫展
<6-1,Raj>Hey, since Sheldon's not going to Comic-Con,

157
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,970
<6-1,Raj>或许我们可以打扮成帅酷三侠
<6-1,Raj>maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.

158
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,300
<6-2,Leonard>不如我们打扮成神奇四侠
<6-2,Leonard>What if we go as The Fantastic Four,

159
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,750
<6-2,Leonard>就告诉其他人其实隐形女侠
<6-2,Leonard>and just tell people that the Invisible Girl

161
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,710
<6-2,Leonard>就站在咱们旁边
<6-2,Leonard>is standing there with us.

162
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,030
<6-3,Howard>我还以为我们假装跟
<6-3,Howard>Oh, and I thought our days of pretending

163
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,490
<6-3,Howard>不存在的女人在一起的日子已经远去
<6-3,Howard>to be with women who don't exist were over.

164
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,130
<6-4,Sheldon>各位  我离为我的动漫展
<6-4,Sheldon>Gentlemen, I am one step away

165
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,350
<6-4,Sheldon>搞到一位重量级来宾  只有一步之遥啦
<6-4,Sheldon>from securing a huge guest for my convention.

166
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,090
<6-5,Leonard>那一步是要用麻醉药把人迷晕
<6-5,Leonard>Does that step include chloroform

167
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,270
<6-5,Leonard>外加五花大绑吗
<6-5,Leonard>and a roll of duct tape?

168
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,820
<6-6,Sheldon>我觉得对于詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯来说
<6-6,Sheldon>I don't think that will be necessary

169
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,030
<6-7,Raj>完全不需要这样
<6-7,Raj>for Mr. James Earl Jones.

170
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,090
<6-6,Sheldon>你们听到了吧
<6-6,Sheldon>You heard me.

171
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,520
<6-6,Sheldon>他是《星际大战》中黑武士
<6-6,Sheldon>The voice of Darth Vader,

172
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,160
<6-6,Sheldon>和《狮子王》中父王的配音员
<6-6,Sheldon>the Lion King's dad,

173
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,510
<6-6,Sheldon>那句"这里是美国有线电视新闻网"也是他说的
<6-6,Sheldon>and FYI, the guy who says, "This is CNN."

174
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,140
<6-6,Sheldon>当然那声音听起来就像黑武士
<6-6,Sheldon>Which also sounds like Darth Vader.

175
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,590
<6-7,Raj>你怎么能请到詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯
<6-7,Raj>How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?

176
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,180
<6-8,Sheldon>很简单  今天早些时候  他在微博上写
<6-8,Sheldon>Simple. Earlier today, he Tweeted

177
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,230
<6-8,Sheldon>他很期待晚上要去
<6-8,Sheldon>that he's looking forward to going to

178
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,760
<6-8,Sheldon>他最爱的寿司店吃晚餐
<6-8,Sheldon>his favorite sushi restaurant for dinner.

179
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,520
<6-8,Sheldon>我搜到四年前采访他的报道
<6-8,Sheldon>I Googled an interview from four years ago

180
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,590
<6-8,Sheldon>恰好是在他最爱的寿司店拍摄的
<6-8,Sheldon>which was conducted in his favorite sushi restaurant.

181
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,750
<6-8,Sheldon>他要去那里  我也会去那里
<6-8,Sheldon>That's where he'll be, and that's where I'm going,

182
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,520
<6-9,Howard>-然后  -然后在那里  黑武士
<6-9,Howard>- and... - And that's where Darth Vader's

183
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,770
<6-9,Howard>会把酱油倒在你头上
<6-9,Howard>gonna pour soy sauce on your head.

184
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,840
<6-10,Leonard>谢尔顿  你要不要一起买黄牛票我无所谓
<6-10,Leonard>Sheldon, I don't care if you get scalped tickets with us or not,

185
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,890
<6-10,Leonard>但拜托别像个变态一样跟踪那个可怜的老头
<6-10,Leonard>but please don't be creepy and go stalking this poor guy.

186
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,600
<6-10,Leonard>你会给自己惹麻烦的
<6-10,Leonard>You're gonna get in trouble.

187
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,780
<6-11,Sheldon>你们才会给自己惹麻烦呢
<6-11,Sheldon>You're the ones who are going to get in trouble.

188
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,930
<6-11,Sheldon>你们居然从一个陌生人手里
<6-11,Sheldon>You're buying non-transferable tickets.

189
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,150
<6-11,Sheldon>买不可转让出售的门票
<6-11,Sheldon>And from a stranger, no less.

190
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,260
<6-11,Sheldon>如果被抓到  你们不但会被禁止参加动漫展
<6-11,Sheldon>Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con,

191
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,100
<6-11,Sheldon>你们还可能被控告轻微盗窃罪
<6-11,Sheldon>if caught, you could be charged with petty theft.

192
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,900
<6-11,Sheldon>当我去警告詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯在微博
<6-11,Sheldon>You think about that while I'm warning James Earl Jones

193
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,560
<6-11,Sheldon>泄露自己行踪的危险性时  你们好好反省下
<6-11,Sheldon>about the danger of posting his location on Twitter.

194
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,070
<6-11,Sheldon>这次碰到我是他走运
<6-11,Sheldon>He got lucky this time.

195
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,840
<6-11,Sheldon>现在外面很多怪胎跟踪狂呢
<6-11,Sheldon>There are some weirdoes out there.

197
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,160
<6-11,Sheldon>忘了拿钥匙了
<6-11,Sheldon>Forgot my keys.

198
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,430
<7-1,Howard (on phone)>好的  可以  再见
<7-1,Howard (on phone)>Okay, great. Bye.

199
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,320
<7-1,Howard (on phone)>我们友好的黄牛党朋友说
<7-1,Howard (on phone)>Our friendly neighborhood scalper

200
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,010
<7-1,Howard (on phone)>他要晚点到
<7-1,Howard (on phone)>says he's running late.

201
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,260
<7-2,Raj>他声音听起来像是罪犯吗
<7-2,Raj>Does he sound like a criminal?

202
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,840
<7-3,Howard>这话什么意思
<7-3,Howard>What do you mean?

203
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,130
<7-4,Raj>他会不会这么说话
<7-4,Raj>You know, did he say things like,

204
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,070
<7-4,Raj>"你们仨小弱鸡"  或者"你们给老子听好了"
<7-4,Raj>"Youse guys," or "listen here, see?"

205
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,320
<7-5,Leonard>对  他迟到是因为
<7-5,Leonard>Yes. He-He's late

206
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,610
<7-5,Leonard>他得从1940年穿越过来
<7-5,Leonard>because he's on his way here from 1940.

207
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,370
<7-6,Raj>提个醒嘛
<7-6,Raj>I'm just saying.

208
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,580
<7-6,Raj>我们不知道这家伙的底细
<7-6,Raj>We don't know who this guy is.

209
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,720
<7-6,Raj>要是他想偷我们的钱  想割我们的肾
<7-6,Raj>What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys,

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,670
<7-6,Raj>或者是想剥我们的皮做衣服怎么办
<7-6,Raj>or make a suit out of our skins?

211
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,170
<7-7,Howard>人家干嘛要用你的皮肤做衣服啊
<7-7,Howard>Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?

212
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,010
<7-7,Howard>谁知道呢
<7-7,Howard>I don't know.

213
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,300
<7-8,Raj>没准是因为深色皮肤比较耐脏
<7-8,Raj>Maybe 'cause dark doesn't show the stains?

214
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,670
<7-9,Leonard>你这么一说  我的确觉得
<7-9,Leonard>Well, now you're making me wonder

215
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,940
<7-9,Leonard>也许我们该选一个中立的地方见面
<7-9,Leonard>if we should have met him at a neutral location.

216
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,970
<7-10,Howard>所以我才叫他到你家来啊
<7-10,Howard>Why do you think I told him to come to your place?

217
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,660
<8-1,Amy>这里的小孩子可真多
<8-1,Amy>There sure are a lot of little kids here.

218
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,800
<8-2,Penny>不敢相信我们居然以为这里会有成熟的感觉
<8-2,Penny>I can't believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.

219
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,940
<8-3,Bernadette>我才不敢相信服务生以为我是你女儿
<8-3,Bernadette>I can't believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.

220
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,830
<8-4,Amy>我上一次梳妆打扮
<8-4,Amy>Well, last time I got dressed up

221
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,810
<8-4,Amy>享受下午茶时光还是在我五岁那年
<8-4,Amy>and had tea was when I was five.

222
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,690
<8-4,Amy>当时有我  我的泰迪熊  破烂娃娃和我的仓鼠
<8-4,Amy>Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster.

223
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,760
<8-6,Amy>-好有爱啊  -的确如此
<8-6,Amy>- That's cute. - It was.

224
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,750
<8-6,Amy>直到我的仓鼠吃光了她的宝宝
<8-6,Amy>Till my hamster ate all her babies.

225
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,900
<8-6,Amy>立刻就不那么可爱了
<8-6,Amy>It got less cute really fast.

226
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,580
<8-7,Bernadette>我们走吗
<8-7,Bernadette>Should we leave?

227
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,080
<8-8,Penny>大厅那里有个酒吧
<8-8,Penny>Well, there's a bar in the lobby.

228
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,010
<8-9,Bernadette>我可以喝上一杯
<8-9,Bernadette>I could go for a drink.

229
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,940
<8-10,Amy>下午就开始喝酒  有其母必有其女
<8-10,Amy>Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.

230
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,930
<9-1,James Earl Jones>让我猜猜
<9-1,James Earl Jones>Let me guess.

231
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,400
<9-1,James Earl Jones>你一定喜欢《星际大战》吧
<9-1,James Earl Jones>You like Star Wars.

232
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,350
<9-1,James Earl Jones>要知道  我也演过其他电影
<9-1,James Earl Jones>You know, I've been in other movies.

233
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,440
<9-1,James Earl Jones>但对你来说其他电影根本无所谓  对吗
<9-1,James Earl Jones>But you don't care about those, do you?

234
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,340
<9-1,James Earl Jones>对你这种人  我只能说一句话
<9-1,James Earl Jones>I have one thing to say to people like you...

235
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,890
<9-1,James Earl Jones>我也好喜欢《星际大战》
<9-1,James Earl Jones>I like Star Wars too.

236
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,800
<9-1,James Earl Jones>愿意赏光坐下吗
<9-1,James Earl Jones>Care to join me?

237
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,810
<9-2,Sheldon>太谢谢你了
<9-2,Sheldon>Thank you.

238
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,410
<9-2,Sheldon>我的朋友莱纳德说
<9-2,Sheldon>My friend Leonard said

239
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,950
<9-2,Sheldon>要是在你吃饭时骚扰你
<9-2,Sheldon>if I bothered you while you were eating,

240
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,090
<9-2,Sheldon>你肯定以为我是个变态跟踪狂
<9-2,Sheldon>you'd think I was a creepy stalker.

241
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,730
<9-3,James Earl Jones>这位莱纳德听起来是个孬种呢
<9-3,James Earl Jones>Well your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.

242
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,870
<9-4,Sheldon>你说对了  厄尔·琼斯先生  他就是
<9-4,Sheldon>He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.

243
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,850
<9-4,Sheldon>我正在浏览一个动漫展的留言板
<9-4,Sheldon>Okay, so, I'm on a Comic-Con message board,

244
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,990
<10-1,Raj>有个家伙发了帖
<10-1,Raj>and there's a post from a guy

245
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,230
<10-1,Raj>说他冒用别人的票被发现了
<10-1,Raj>where he says he got caught using someone else's badge...

246
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,370
<10-1,Raj>而且谢尔顿也说对了
<10-1,Raj>and Sheldon was right--

247
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,250
<10-1,Raj>他被以轻微盗窃罪起诉了  各位
<10-1,Raj>he did get charged with petty theft. Guys...

248
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,170
<10-1,Raj>要是我穿着霹雳侠的服装被送进监狱
<10-1,Raj>if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch,

250
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,880
<10-1,Raj>肯定会引起误会的
<10-1,Raj>that might send the wrong message.

251
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,420
<10-2,Leonard>或许这的确不是个好主意
<10-2,Leonard>Maybe this isn't a good idea.

252
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,660
<10-3,Howard>我可以给他发短信说我们反悔了
<10-3,Howard>I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.

253
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,390
<10-4,Raj>就这么做吧
<10-4,Raj>Do it.

254
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,720
<10-5,Howard>好呀
<10-5,Howard>Okay.

255
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,250
<10-5,Howard>我们正式决定不去动漫展
<10-5,Howard>We're officially not going to Comic-Con.

256
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,150
<10-6,Leonard>等一下  我们总做同样的事
<10-6,Leonard>Hold on. We always do this.

257
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,000
<10-7,Howard>-做什么事  -临阵退缩
<10-7,Howard>- Do what? - Chicken out.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,050
<10-8,Leonard>我们太害怕惹祸上身
<10-8,Leonard>We're-we're so afraid of getting into trouble

259
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,030
<10-8,Leonard>所以我们从来也不敢做坏事
<10-8,Leonard>that we never do anything wrong.

260
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,320
<10-9,Raj>因为我们是好人啊
<10-9,Raj>That's 'cause we're the good guys.

261
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
<10-10,Leonard>就算是蝙蝠侠也有不守规矩的时候
<10-10,Leonard>Even Batman breaks the rules.

262
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,910
<10-11,Raj>你知道我对蝙蝠侠爱恨交加
<10-11,Raj>You know I struggle with Batman.

263
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,170
<10-12,Leonard>就这一次也好
<10-12,Leonard>I-I say, this one time,

264
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,460
<10-12,Leonard>别再畏手畏脚了  让我们放纵一次吧
<10-12,Leonard>instead of wimping out, let's be badasses!

265
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,760
<10-13,Raj>好呀  变坏就变坏
<10-13,Raj>Okay, I'll be a badass--

266
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,590
<10-13,Raj>可你要和人家打勾勾约定你也要变坏
<10-13,Raj>but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.

267
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,660
<10-14,Leonard>-霍华德  你要加入吗  -不用了
<10-14,Leonard>- Howard, you in on this? - No need.

268
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,220
<10-15,Howard>哥就是一个不守规矩的活教材
<10-15,Howard>I'm breaking rules all the time.

269
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,340
<10-16,Leonard>-举个例子  -昨晚
<10-16,Leonard>- Name one. - Last night.

270
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,160
<10-17,Howard>我直接从瓶嘴喝了舒胃灵
<10-17,Howard>Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.

271
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,280
<10-18,Raj>你没用人家发附赠的小杯杯吗
<10-18,Raj>What about that little cup they give you?

272
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,710
<10-18,Raj>没错
<10-18,Raj>Yeah.

273
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,570
<10-19,Howard>那又怎么样
<10-19,Howard>What about it?

274
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,810
<10-20,Raj>有被他的气势震住吗
<10-20,Raj>A-Are you impressed by that?

275
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,390
<10-22,Raj>-有一点  -我也是
<10-22,Raj>- A little. - Yeah, me, too.

276
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,460
<11-1,James>当我读《帝国反击战》的剧本
<11-1,James>You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back

277
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,940
<11-1,James>第一次读到黑武士告诉卢克自己是他父亲时
<11-1,James>and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father...

278
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,400
<11-1,James>我想这家伙肯定在说谎
<11-1,James>...I thought for sure he was lying.

279
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,370
<11-1,James>我也有同感
<11-1,James>Me, too!

280
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,820
<11-2,Sheldon>可他没有说谎  对不对
<11-2,Sheldon>But he wasn't, was he?

281
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,570
<11-3,James>他没有
<11-3,James>He was not!

282
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,290
<11-3,James>还能再狗血一点吗
<11-3,James>How messed up was that?!

283
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,020
<11-4,Sheldon>太狗血了
<11-4,Sheldon>So messed up.

284
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,030
<11-5,James>我们一起去开心一下  好不好
<11-5,James>What do you say let's go have some fun?

285
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,110
<11-5,James>我老婆在纽约
<11-5,James>My wife's in New York,

286
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,240
<11-5,James>我有一张《狮子王》的酬金支票
<11-5,James>and I got a Lion King residual check

287
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,890
<11-5,James>都快在我口袋里磨出茧来了
<11-5,James>burning a hole in my pocket.

288
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,650
<12-1,Penny>所以  下午茶一点不好玩
<12-1,Penny>So, afternoon tea was a bust.

289
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,310
<12-2,Amy>从好的方面看  每个六岁的小女孩
<12-2,Amy>On the bright side, every six-year-old there

290
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,950
<12-2,Amy>都对我的皇冠羡慕嫉妒恨
<12-2,Amy>was jealous of my tiara.

291
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,100
<12-2,Amy>实话实说  这种感觉倍儿爽
<12-2,Amy>Not gonna lie-- it felt good.

292
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,340
<12-3,Penny>我问你
<12-3,Penny>Let me ask you a question:

293
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,000
<12-3,Penny>你们何时开始意识到自己长大成人了
<12-3,Penny>When did you guys start feeling grown up?

294
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,110
<12-3,Penny>因为我对自己有点迷惘了
<12-3,Penny>'Cause I am not sure I do.

295
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,320
<12-4,Bernadette>老实说  我以为结婚会让我变得成熟
<12-4,Bernadette>Honestly, I thought when I got married I would,

296
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,070
<12-4,Bernadette>可我依然觉得自己还在拼命装大人
<12-4,Bernadette>but I still kind of feel like I'm pretending.

297
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,110
<12-4,Bernadette>衣服都是童装部买的  难怪会底气不足
<12-4,Bernadette>It doesn't help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.

298
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
<12-5,Penny>我算是个成年人了
<12-5,Penny>Okay, so I'm an adult,

299
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,220
<12-5,Penny>那天我看到一位老人滑倒在地
<12-5,Penny>and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down,

300
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,560
<12-5,Penny>于是我笑了
<12-5,Penny>and I laughed.

301
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,240
<12-5,Penny>笑得花枝乱颤
<12-5,Penny>I mean, I laughed hard.

302
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,980
<12-5,Penny>简直是  放声大笑
<12-5,Penny>Like-like, out loud.

303
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,540
<12-5,Penny>他如果没昏过去  肯定听到我在大声笑
<12-5,Penny>If he was conscious, he would've heard me.

304
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,430
<12-6,Amy>-天啊  -我知道
<12-6,Amy>- Oh, my gosh. - I know.

305
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,260
<12-7,Penny>他的助行器上垫底的网球掉了一颗
<12-7,Penny>One of the tennis balls came off his walker

306
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,900
<12-7,Penny>正好弹在他的头上  那真是
<12-7,Penny>and bounced right off his head. I mean...

307
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,090
<12-7,Penny>我差点笑尿了
<12-7,Penny>I... I almost wet myself.

308
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,400
<12-7,Penny>不身临其境是无法体会滴
<12-7,Penny>I guess you had to be there.

309
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,850
<12-8,Amy>我觉得我比你们都惨
<12-8,Amy>I think I have you both beat.

310
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,970
<12-8,Amy>试想一下  我得硬装出成熟
<12-8,Amy>Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up

311
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,810
<12-8,Amy>可我从来没跟男人发生过关系
<12-8,Amy>when you've never even been with a man.

312
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,230
<12-9,Penny>做爱不代表你就长大了
<12-9,Penny>Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.

313
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,680
<12-10,Bernadette>对啊  不然这里你最老了
<12-10,Bernadette>Yeah. Or you'd be the oldest one here.

314
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,110
<12-10,Bernadette>是吗
<12-10,Bernadette>Really?

315
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,860
<12-11,Penny>你就这么跟你老妈说话的吗
<12-11,Penny>Is that how you talk to your mother?

316
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,050
<13-1,Howard>他停车了  马上上来
<13-1,Howard>He just parked. He's on his way up.

317
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,320
<13-2,Leonard>太好了  好激动啊
<13-2,Leonard>Good. This is exciting.

318
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,140
<13-3,Raj>-就是  -是啊
<13-3,Raj>- It is. I feel alive. - Yeah.

319
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,290
<13-4,Leonard>就算我们被抓了又有什么所谓
<13-4,Leonard>What if we do get caught; who cares?

320
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,900
<13-4,Leonard>不就是被禁止参加动漫展嘛
<13-4,Leonard>So we get banned from Comic-Con.

321
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,770
<13-5,Raj>-也许交个罚款  -不不
<13-5,Raj>- Maybe slapped with a fine. - Oh, no.

322
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,670
<13-6,Howard>我既是宇航员  又是坏男人
<13-6,Howard>I'll be an astronaut and a bad boy--

323
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,590
<13-6,Howard>女人怎么克制得住对我的冲动呢
<13-6,Howard>how will women keep their pants on?

324
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,870
<13-7,Raj>或许当我申请公民资格时  还能显摆一下这事
<13-7,Raj>Uh, maybe it'll come up when I apply for citizenship.

325
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,600
<13-7,Raj>靠  万一申请公民资格时  这事被知道了怎么办
<13-7,Raj>Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?

326
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,530
<13-8,Leonard>不知道我们申请津贴时  这种事
<13-8,Leonard>I wonder if we'd have to disclose something like this

327
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,940
<13-8,Leonard>需不需要坦白上报
<13-8,Leonard>when we apply for grants.

328
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,560
<13-9,Raj>他马上就来了  我们怎么办
<13-9,Raj>He's gonna be here any second-- what should we do?

329
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,850
<13-10,Howard>你们这两个没用的小屁孩
<13-10,Howard>You guys are such babies.

330
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,770
<13-10,Howard>交给哥处理吧
<13-10,Howard>I'll handle this.

331
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,400
<13-10,Howard>如果他以为我们不在家  就会走了
<13-10,Howard>If he thinks we're not home, he'll go away.

332
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,410
<13-11,Raj>你不是坏男人吗
<13-11,Raj>I thought you were a badass.

333
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,660
<13-12,Howard>舒胃灵的事我说谎了  我都是用小杯子喝的
<13-12,Howard>I lied about the Pepto-- I always use the little cup!

334
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,630
<14-1,Sheldon>你小时候  曾经是个结巴
<14-1,Sheldon>Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer

335
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,820
<14-1,Sheldon>而且八年不能说话  这事是真的吗
<14-1,Sheldon>and were functionally mute for eight years?

336
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,450
<14-2,James>是真的
<14-2,James>It is true.

337
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,140
<14-3,Sheldon>他们用水中呼吸器制造出
<14-3,Sheldon>Is it true they used scuba gear

338
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,510
<14-3,Sheldon>黑武士的呼吸声  这事是真的吗
<14-3,Sheldon>to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?

339
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,460
<14-4,James>是真的
<14-4,James>They sure did.

340
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,300
<14-5,Sheldon>你读过医学预科  差点成为医生
<14-5,Sheldon>Is it true that you were premed in college

341
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,010
<14-5,Sheldon>这事是真的吗
<14-5,Sheldon>and you almost became a doctor?

342
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,230
<14-6,James>千真万确
<14-6,James>That's right.

343
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,510
<14-7,Sheldon>詹姆斯
<14-7,Sheldon>Oh, James!

344
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,850
<14-7,Sheldon>你的故事  我听一整晚都不腻
<14-7,Sheldon>I could listen to your stories all night.

345
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,370
<15-1,Penny>说真的  长大成人有什么好的呀
<15-1,Penny>I mean, really, what's so great about being grown up?

346
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,900
<15-2,Bernadette>首先  这张账单可以三人平分
<15-2,Bernadette>Well, for starters, we'd be splitting this check three ways.

347
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,070
<15-3,Penny>我说真的  谁愿意做这些事啊
<15-3,Penny>I'm serious. Who wants to do all that stuff?

348
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,080
<15-3,Penny>买保险  还贷款
<15-3,Penny>Have insurance, pay mortgages,

349
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,800
<15-3,Penny>撞到停着的车后  还要留张自己联系方式的小条
<15-3,Penny>leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.

350
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,970
<15-4,Amy>我跟你说了是佩妮
<15-4,Amy>I told you it was Penny.

351
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,590
<15-5,Penny>拜托  不是我
<15-5,Penny>Oh, come on, it wasn't me.

<15-5,Penny>Anyone could have knocked your mirror off...

353
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,820
<15-5,Penny>或是其它什么的

354
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,710
<15-6,Amy>也许男生们说得对
<15-6,Amy>Maybe the guys are right.

<15-6,Amy>我们整晚都想显得成熟
<15-6,Amy>I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature,

356
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,460
<15-6,Amy>其实蛮无聊的
<15-6,Amy>and it was kind of boring.

357
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,060
<15-6,Amy>我相信他们一定比我们要玩得开心
<15-6,Amy>I'm sure they're having more fun than we are.

<18-6,Sheldon>我不明白这是做什么
<18-6,Sheldon>I don't understand what we're doing.

369
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,880
<18-7,James>这是谁的家

<18-8,Sheldon>凯莉·费雪

<19-1,James>Okay.

378
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,820
<19-2,Sheldon>但我觉得卡拉OK时就已经是完美的结局
<19-2,Sheldon>Yeah, but I think it could have ended with the karaoke.
