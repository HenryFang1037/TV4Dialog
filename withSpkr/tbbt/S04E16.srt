00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,200
<1-12,Bernadette>自己戴假发
<1-12,Bernadette>to put a wig on by herself.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,220
<1-13,Howard>不仅仅是假发
<1-13,Howard>It's not just the wig.

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,520
<4-9,Raj>"吡毙之"
<4-9,Raj>"Forbaded" it?

139
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,630
<4-10,Priya>给我让开
<4-10,Priya>Get out of the way.

140
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,490
<4-11,Leonard>你来做什么
<4-11,Leonard>What are you doing here?

141
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,690
<4-11,Leonard>你又是来做什么
<4-11,Leonard>What are you doing here?

142
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,560
<4-12,Priya>我在洛杉矶有点公事
<4-12,Priya>I have business in Los Angeles.

143
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,760
<4-13,Leonard>为什么不给我打电话
<4-13,Leonard>Why didn't you call?

144
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,020
<4-14,Raj>显然啊  她在暗示你
<4-14,Raj>Clearly, she was sending you a message

145
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,040
<4-14,Raj>滚远点  迈克同学
<4-14,Raj>to take a hike, Mike.

146
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,480
<4-15,Priya>不好意思  我想过给你打电话
<4-15,Priya>I'm sorry. I thought about calling,

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,100
<4-15,Priya>但我不知道和你再见面到底合不合适
<4-15,Priya>but I just wasn't sure if seeing you was such a good idea.

148
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,840
<4-16,Leonard>我懂  上次我有些太着急了
<4-16,Leonard>I know. Last time I came on too strong.

149
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,350
<4-16,Leonard>咱俩能单独聊聊吗
<4-16,Leonard>Can we talk in private?

150
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,090
<4-18,Priya>-不行  -行啊
<4-18,Priya>- No! - Sure.

151
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,400
<4-19,Raj>一个单身女人私下招待男性
<4-19,Raj>It's completely inappropriate for a single woman

152
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,960
<4-19,Raj>这实在太荒唐了
<4-19,Raj>to entertain a man in private.

153
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,770
<4-19,Raj>要是你俩非得聊的话  就在沙发上聊
<4-19,Raj>If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch!

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,510
<4-19,Raj>好吧  你俩可以在卧室里聊
<4-19,Raj>All right, you may talk in the bedroom,

155
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,580
<4-19,Raj>但是我要求你们不许关门
<4-19,Raj>but I want this door to remain open!

156
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,630
<4-19,Raj>好吧  这次让你关门
<4-19,Raj>All right, just this once you may close the door.

157
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,170
<4-19,Raj>但你给我记住  我就在外面
<4-19,Raj>But keep in mind I'll be right out here

158
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,900
<4-19,Raj>监视你俩的动向
<4-19,Raj>monitoring the situation!

159
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,440
<4-19,Raj>该死
<4-19,Raj>Oh, damn it.

160
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,950
<4-19,Raj>莱纳德  听到这条留言后请速回电
<4-19,Raj>Leonard, when you get this message, call me.

161
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,520
<4-19,Raj>普丽娅  我是你哥
<4-19,Raj>Priya, this is your brother.

162
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,350
<4-19,Raj>听到留言后请让莱纳德查收他的语音信箱
<4-19,Raj>When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.

163
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,540
<5-1,Sheldon>你今晚还住我们那儿吗
<5-1,Sheldon>Would you be sleeping over again this evening?

164
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,290
<5-1,Sheldon>因为我们很欢迎你
<5-1,Sheldon>Because you're welcome to.

165
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,580
<5-2,Howard>承蒙美意  但是我自己有计划
<5-2,Howard>That's very nice of you, but I made other plans.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,020
<5-3,Sheldon>你只要记得只要你需要一位
<5-3,Sheldon>Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need

167
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,920
<5-3,Sheldon>略显冷淡的第三好的朋友
<5-3,Sheldon>a slightly apathetic tertiary friend,

168
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,460
<5-3,Sheldon>我时刻准备着
<5-3,Sheldon>I stand at the ready.

169
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,310
<5-4,Priya>嗨  霍华德  嗨  谢尔顿
<5-4,Priya>Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.

170
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,210
<5-6,Sheldon>-嗨  -嗨
<5-6,Sheldon>- Hello. - Hey.

171
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,140
<5-7,Raj>你俩为啥牵着手
<5-7,Raj>Why are you holding hands?

172
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,120
<5-7,Raj>我禁止你俩牵手
<5-7,Raj>I forbid you to hold hands.

173
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,750
<5-8,Priya>拉杰  你知道莱纳德和我一起过夜了
<5-8,Priya>Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.

174
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,970
<5-9,Raj>对  但是你俩只是睡觉而已
<5-9,Raj>Yeah, but you were just sleeping,

175
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,260
<5-9,Raj>因为我禁子你俩做爱了
<5-9,Raj>because I forboded you to have sex.

176
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,550
<5-10,Leonard>应该是"禁止"
<5-10,Leonard>The word is "forbade""

177
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,410
<5-11,Raj>你确定吗  听起来怪怪的
<5-11,Raj>You sure? That doesn't sound right.

178
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,390
<5-12,Priya>听着  拉杰  莱纳德和我已经决定
<5-12,Priya>Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided

179
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,830
<5-12,Priya>重拾旧情了
<5-12,Priya>to see each other again,

180
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,190
<5-12,Priya>你不可以决定
<5-12,Priya>and you don't get to tell me

181
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,760
<5-12,Priya>我该和谁拍拖
<5-12,Priya>who I can and can't have a relationship with.

182
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,440
<5-13,Sheldon>其实  他可以
<5-13,Sheldon>Actually, he can.

183
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,300
<5-13,Sheldon>印度的《摩奴法典》对这类问题有明确规定
<5-13,Sheldon>The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters.

184
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,330
<5-13,Sheldon>如果一个女人的父亲不在
<5-13,Sheldon>If a woman's father is not around,

185
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,050
<5-13,Sheldon>那么控制她基本欲望的责任
<5-13,Sheldon>the duty of controlling her base desires falls

186
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,880
<5-13,Sheldon>就落在了她最亲的男性亲属身上  也就是拉杰
<5-13,Sheldon>to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj.

187
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,940
<5-13,Sheldon>法典还规定
<5-13,Sheldon>The code also states

188
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,670
<5-13,Sheldon>如果她违背了的话  她下辈子将
<5-13,Sheldon>that if she disobeys, she will be reborn

189
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,950
<5-13,Sheldon>"投胎为豺  疾病缠身"
<5-13,Sheldon>"in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases."

190
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,940
<5-13,Sheldon>如果这是真的
<5-13,Sheldon>If true,

191
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,040
<5-13,Sheldon>考虑到奖品只是莱纳德
<5-13,Sheldon>that seems like an awfully large gamble

192
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,620
<5-13,Sheldon>你这个赌注貌似下得大了点
<5-13,Sheldon>given that the prize is Leonard.

193
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,050
<5-14,Raj>就是这样  普丽娅  我们是印度人
<5-14,Raj>There it is, Priya. We're Indian.

194
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,570
<5-14,Raj>就信这些玩意
<5-14,Raj>We believe this stuff.

195
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,110
<5-15,Priya>我觉得法典上还说  如果你吃牛肉了
<5-15,Priya>I think it also says that if you eat beef,

196
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,700
<5-15,Priya>就得和母牛一起住三个月
<5-15,Priya>you need to live with cows for three months

197
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,790
<5-15,Priya>天天喝牛尿
<5-15,Priya>and drink their urine.

198
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,030
<5-16,Raj>良莠参半  不可全信
<5-16,Raj>Some of it makes sense, some of it's crazy.

199
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,540
<5-16,Raj>我是说  你不能和莱纳德在一起
<5-16,Raj>My point is, you can't go out with Leonard.

200
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,670
<5-17,Penny (arriving)>谁不能和莱纳德在一起
<5-17,Penny (arriving)>Who can't go out with Leonard?

201
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,080
<5-18,Raj>我妹妹
<5-18,Raj>My sister.

202
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,270
<5-19,Leonard>佩妮  这位是拉杰的妹妹  普丽娅
<5-19,Leonard>Penny, this is Raj's sister, Priya.

203
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,560
<5-20,Priya>很高兴见到你
<5-20,Priya>It's very nice to meet you.

204
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,180
<5-21,Penny>哦  我也是
<5-21,Penny>Oh, yeah, you, too.

205
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,350
<5-22,Sheldon>普丽娅  如果你觉得有些紧张或者尴尬
<5-22,Sheldon>Priya, if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness,

206
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,380
<5-22,Sheldon>很可能是因为莱纳德和佩妮以前曾经
<5-22,Sheldon>it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to--

207
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,440
<5-22,Sheldon>用霍华德的话来说叫做"赤裸共舞"
<5-22,Sheldon>if I may quote Howard-- "do the dance with no pants."

208
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,100
<5-23,Penny>谢尔顿
<5-23,Penny>Sheldon!

209
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,370
<5-24,Leonard>你非得这么说吗
<5-24,Leonard>Really?

210
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,380
<5-25,Howard>伯纳黛特  我能跟你说句话吗
<5-25,Howard>Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?

211
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,570
<5-26,Bernadette>好
<5-26,Bernadette>Sure.

212
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,660
<5-27,Raj>佩妮  作为莱纳德曾经的恋人  你和他
<5-27,Raj>Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard

213
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,520
<5-27,Raj>分手了
<5-27,Raj>as a lover.

214
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,730
<5-27,Raj>能不能跟我妹妹说说是为啥
<5-27,Raj>Would you please tell my sister why?

215
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,680
<5-28,Howard>跟你说哈  我妈要去棕榈泉市
<5-28,Howard>Listen, my mom's going to Palm Springs

216
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
<5-28,Howard>拜访她妹妹
<5-28,Howard>to visit her sister.

217
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,730
<5-28,Howard>我就有整整两个晚上
<5-28,Howard>That's two whole nights in a row I can sleep over

218
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,160
<5-28,Howard>能陪着你到天亮了
<5-28,Howard>with you all the way to morning.

219
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,940
<5-28,Howard>除非沙漠的干旱气候让她鼻窦干得厉害
<5-28,Howard>Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses,

220
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,280
<5-28,Howard>那样的话我就得扛着
<5-28,Howard>in which case I'll have to schlep out there

221
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,870
<5-28,Howard>庞大的增湿器赶过去
<5-28,Howard>with the big humidifier.

222
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,440
<5-28,Howard>就这样吗
<5-28,Howard>That's it?

223
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,660
<5-29,Bernadette>这就是解决咱俩这些问题的妙招吗
<5-29,Bernadette>That's your big solution to all of our problems?

224
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,690
<5-29,Bernadette>趁你妈不注意  我们才得两晌贪欢
<5-29,Bernadette>If your mom's nose holds up, we get two nights together?

225
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,070
<5-30,Howard>这不很美妙吗
<5-30,Howard>Isn't that great?

226
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,250
<5-31,Bernadette>不  并不好
<5-31,Bernadette>No, it's not great.

227
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,010
<5-31,Bernadette>你得作出选择  要我还是你妈
<5-31,Bernadette>You need to make a choice.Me or your mother.

228
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,370
<5-33,Bernadette>回答错误
<5-33,Bernadette>Wrong answer.

229
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,860
<5-34,Howard>不  等等
<5-34,Howard>No, wait.

230
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,800
<5-34,Howard>我还没说完
<5-34,Howard>You didn't let me finish.

231
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,440
<5-35,Bernadette>我听着呢
<5-35,Bernadette>I'm listening.

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,360
<6-1,Amy>我尽最快速度赶来了
<6-1,Amy>I came as quickly as I could.

233
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,240
<6-2,Penny>好的
<6-2,Penny>Okay.

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,510
<6-2,Penny>为什么
<6-2,Penny>Why?

235
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,430
<6-3,Amy>当然是赶来安慰你
<6-3,Amy>To comfort you, of course.

236
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,970
<6-3,Amy>谢尔顿说了莱纳德跟拉杰妹妹约会的事
<6-3,Amy>Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh's sister.

237
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,160
<6-3,Amy>所以我赶到这里
<6-3,Amy>So I high-tailed it over here

238
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,460
<6-3,Amy>来安慰你破碎的心
<6-3,Amy>to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.

239
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,310
<6-4,Penny>艾米  我没事
<6-4,Penny>Amy, I'm fine.

240
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,520
<6-5,Amy>你不用在我面前逞强的
<6-5,Amy>You don't have to be strong for me.

241
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,290
<6-5,Amy>我们来谈谈普丽娅那偷男人的婊子
<6-5,Amy>Now let's talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.

242
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,710
<6-6,Penny>什么
<6-6,Penny>What?

243
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,110
<6-7,Amy>在这样的情况下
<6-7,Amy>In situations like this,

244
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,250
<6-7,Amy>闺蜜经常都一起声讨小三的
<6-7,Amy>best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman.

245
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,030
<6-8,Penny>真的  我对莱纳德和普丽娅的事毫不伤心
<6-8,Penny>Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.

246
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,190
<6-9,Amy>那你可能是并不清楚是怎么回事
<6-9,Amy>Oh. Then perhaps you don't understand what's going on.

247
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,130
<6-9,Amy>你的前男友另找了
<6-9,Amy>Your former boyfriend has replaced you

248
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,230
<6-9,Amy>一个看上去非常相配的女友
<6-9,Amy>with what appears to be a very suitable mate.

249
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,840
<6-9,Amy>可以说比你更相配得多
<6-9,Amy>Arguably much more suitable than you.

250
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,170
<6-10,Penny>好吧  那对他来说不错啊
<6-10,Penny>Oh. Well, good for him.

251
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,750
<6-10,Penny>你说"更相配"是什么意思
<6-10,Penny>Hey, what do you mean, "More suitable"?

252
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,290
<6-11,Amy>佩妮  虽然你的第二性征
<6-11,Amy>Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics

253
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,550
<6-11,Amy>相当明显
