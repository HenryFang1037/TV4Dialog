<5-13,Penny>《生活大爆炸》前情回顾
<5-13,Penny>Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,020
<9-3,Bert>这只是一点小挫折
<9-3,Bert>This is just a minor setback.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,310
<9-4,Amy>这不是  明白吗
<9-4,Amy>No, it's not, okay?

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,910
<9-5,Bert>我已经离家拼搏十年了
<9-5,Bert>I've been out here for, like, ten years.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,650
<9-6,Amy>我依然一无所有
<9-6,Amy>I have nothing to show for it.

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,570
<9-7,Bert>你有我啊
<9-7,Bert>Well, you have me.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,100
<9-8,Amy>我的确拥有你
<9-8,Amy>I do have you.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,260
<9-8,Amy>莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
<9-8,Amy>Leonard Hofstadter,

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,250
<9-8,Amy>你愿意娶我吗
<9-8,Amy>will you marry me?

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,850
<1-1,Sheldon>你刚才那一声是在犹豫吗
<1-1,Sheldon>Did you seriously just say, "Um..."?

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,430
<1-2,Leonard>-这太过分了  -我明白
<1-2,Leonard>- It's an outrage. - I know.

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,770
<1-3,Sheldon>大学的高层觉得他们想干嘛就能干嘛
<1-3,Sheldon>The university-- they think they can do whatever they want.

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,430
<1-3,Sheldon>我们只能乖乖任由摆布
<1-3,Sheldon>We just have to sit there and take it.

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,630
<1-4,Leonard>别老拽着这事不放了  谢尔顿
<1-4,Leonard>You need to let it go, Sheldon.

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,800
<1-5,Sheldon>我没日没夜地为他们干活  却落得如此下场
<1-5,Sheldon>You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,450
<1-6,Leonard>我的老天啊
<1-6,Leonard>Oh, my God!

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,800
<1-6,Leonard>他们就是让你把年假用掉而已
<1-6,Leonard>They're just making you use your vacation days!

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,610
<1-7,Sheldon>可我不想放假
<1-7,Sheldon>But I don't want a vacation.

20
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,320
<1-8,Leonard>我不想轻视你心灵受到的创伤
<1-8,Leonard>Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through,

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,240
<1-8,Leonard>但我现在真的没心思
<1-8,Leonard>but I'm a little distracted right now.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,080
<1-9,Sheldon>又是因为那事啊
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, this again?

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,720
<1-9,Sheldon>不就是佩妮求了婚  你没答应嘛
<1-9,Sheldon>So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes,

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,840
<1-9,Sheldon>所以现在你天天发愁到底会不会失去她
<1-9,Sheldon>and now you think you may have lost her love forever.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,810
<1-9,Sheldon>这破事怎么比得上我被人
<1-9,Sheldon>How does this compare to me being forced

26
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,490
<1-9,Sheldon>逼迫放假来得惨啊
<1-9,Sheldon>to relax for a few days?

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,420
<1-11,Sheldon>-完全比不上  -就是嘛
<1-11,Sheldon>- It doesn't! - Thank you!

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,900
<1-12,Leonard>我要去跟佩妮谈谈
<1-12,Leonard>I'm gonna go talk to Penny.

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,070
<1-13,Sheldon>我要回家穿上我最舒服的睡衣
<1-13,Sheldon>I'm going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas,

30
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,340
<1-13,Sheldon>蜷在床上看本好书
<1-13,Sheldon>curl up with a good book

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,870
<1-13,Sheldon>等待这场噩梦的结束
<1-13,Sheldon>and wait for this nightmare to be over.

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,700
<1-14,Penny>佩妮
<1-14,Penny>Penny.

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,140
<1-15,Leonard>抱歉  情不自禁
<1-15,Leonard>Sorry.

34
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,550
<1-16,Penny>抱歉没回你短信
<1-16,Penny>Hey. Look, I'm sorry I didn't text you back.

35
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,980
<1-16,Penny>我只是需要点时间想想
<1-16,Penny>I just needed some time to think.

36
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,010
<1-18,Penny>-没事  -来  进来吧
<1-18,Penny>- Okay. - Here. Come in.

37
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,040
<1-19,Leonard>如果你是想要分手  就说出来吧
<1-19,Leonard>Look, if you want to break up, just say it.

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,520
<1-21,Leonard>-莱纳德...  -别别别  我收回那句话
<1-21,Leonard>- Leonard... - No, no, no, no. I take it back.

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,740
<1-21,Leonard>千万别分手  恨我就好  别离开我
<1-21,Leonard>Don't say it. Just-just hate me, but stay with me.

40
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,830
<1-21,Leonard>反正我爸妈也这样
<1-21,Leonard>It worked for my parents.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,460
<1-22,Penny>听我说  我没想要跟你分手
<1-22,Penny>Listen, I don't want to break up with you.

42
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,040
<1-22,Penny>那就好
<1-22,Penny>Oh. O-Okay.

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,980
<1-23,Leonard>很好  很好
<1-23,Leonard>Good, good.

44
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,640
<1-23,Leonard>不介意我落两滴男儿泪吧
<1-23,Leonard>So, it's cool if I cry a little?

45
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,700
<1-24,Penny>要我就不会这么做
<1-24,Penny>Yeah, I probably wouldn't.

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,750
<1-25,Leonard>同意
<1-25,Leonard>Yeah.

47
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,800
<1-26,Penny>你昨晚的做法是正确的
<1-26,Penny>Look, you did the right thing last night.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,130
<1-26,Penny>我当时脑子不清楚
<1-26,Penny>I was a mess.

49
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,580
<1-26,Penny>当时我因为事业不顺  内心严重受挫
<1-26,Penny>I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.

50
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,570
<1-27,Leonard>我理解  我也想你知道
<1-27,Leonard>Look, I get it, and I want you to know

51
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,120
<1-27,Leonard>无论你想做什么事  我都支持你
<1-27,Leonard>that I support whatever you want to do.

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,010
<1-28,Penny>那就好  因为我在想
<1-28,Penny>Great, because I've been thinking,

53
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,560
<1-28,Penny>如果我真想要演员事业能成功
<1-28,Penny>if I really want this acting thing to work,

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,680
<1-28,Penny>我就得身心完全投入
<1-28,Penny>I need to focus all my energy on it.

55
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,770
<1-28,Penny>为了做到真正投入
<1-28,Penny>And to do that,

56
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,230
<1-29,Leonard>我决定辞芝士蛋糕工厂的服务员工作
<1-29,Leonard>I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.

57
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,640
<1-29,Leonard>-这是个大改变啊  -我知道
<1-29,Leonard>- That-That's a big step. - I know.

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,750
<1-31,Leonard>所以在你做任何冲动的...
<1-31,Leonard>So, you know, before making any rash...

59
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,720
<1-32,Penny>-我已经辞职了  -那我也支持你
<1-32,Penny>- I already quit. - And I support you!

<2-3,Sheldon>What if there's a big breakthrough in science today

69
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,620
<2-3,Sheldon>我却错过无法见证呢
<2-3,Sheldon>and I'm not there to see it?

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,130
<2-4,Leonard>你真的觉得你如果不在  科学界能有什么
<2-4,Leonard>Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough

71
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,340
<2-4,Leonard>重大突破吗
<2-4,Leonard>without you there to do it?

72
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,790
<2-5,Sheldon>当然不会有  这是陷阱题
<2-5,Sheldon>No. I was just tricking you.

73
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,340
<2-6,Leonard>再会

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,120
<2-11,Sheldon>抱歉  我就是要跟着你
<2-11,Sheldon>Too bad. I'm coming with you.

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,630
<2-12,Leonard>-谢尔顿  停  -但是...
<2-12,Leonard>- Oh, Sheldon, stay! - But...

79
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,400
<2-13,Sheldon>乖乖待着
<2-13,Sheldon>I said stay!

80
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,610
<2-14,Leonard>我要去上班了
<2-14,Leonard>I'm going to work.

81
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,700
<2-14,Leonard>不许跟着我
<2-14,Leonard>Do not follow me.

82
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,500
<3-1,Bernadette>斯图尔特
<3-1,Bernadette>Hey, Stuart.

83
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,030
<3-3,Bernadette>-你好啊  -抱歉  我吓到你了吗
<3-3,Bernadette>- Hey. - Sorry. Did I startle you?

84
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,080
<3-4,Stuart>没关系  这时间所有客人都会吓到我
<3-4,Stuart>Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does.

85
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,510
<3-4,Stuart>你要买什么
<3-4,Stuart>What can I do for you?

86
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,000
<3-5,Bernadette>我需要你帮个忙
<3-5,Bernadette>Well, I need a little help.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,760
<3-5,Bernadette>今早我不小心弄坏了霍华德的一本漫画书
<3-5,Bernadette>I accidentally destroyed one of Howard's comic books this morning,

88
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,530
<3-5,Bernadette>所以我想买一本来替换
<3-5,Bernadette>and I was hoping I could replace it.

89
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,960
<3-6,Stuart>发生了什么事
<3-6,Stuart>Wow. What happened?

90
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,180
<3-7,Bernadette>蝙蝠侠被我的烫发棒给虐了
<3-7,Bernadette>Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.

91
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,190
<3-8,Stuart>可别把这个秘密告诉谜语人
<3-8,Stuart>Well, don't let The Riddler know that.

93
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,000
<3-8,Stuart>这是个漫画哏啦
<3-8,Stuart>It's a comic book joke.

94
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,060
<3-8,Stuart>也可能不是哏吧
<3-8,Stuart>Or maybe it's not.

95
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,990
<3-9,Bernadette>你还有这本书吗
<3-9,Bernadette>Do you have this one?

96
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,810
<3-10,Stuart>这本书市面上很少见了
<3-10,Stuart>Uh, well, it's-it's pretty rare.

97
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,240
<3-10,Stuart>我需要几天时间找一下
<3-10,Stuart>Can you give me a few days to track it down?

98
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,460
<3-11,Bernadette>我还希望能在华仔下班
<3-11,Bernadette>Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it

99
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,050
<3-11,Bernadette>回家之前就把书换掉
<3-11,Bernadette>before Howie comes home from work.

100
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,120
<3-12,Stuart>干嘛这么着急
<3-12,Stuart>Oh. What's the hurry?

101
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,110
<3-13,Bernadette>他平时就爱念叨
<3-13,Bernadette>Well, he's always saying

102
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,300
<3-13,Bernadette>让我用烫发棒的时候多注意点
<3-13,Bernadette>I should be more careful with my curling iron,

103
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,640
<3-13,Bernadette>要是让他发现
<3-13,Bernadette>and it seems like a dangerous precedent

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,830
<3-13,Bernadette>他也有说对的时候就惨了
<3-13,Bernadette>to let him think he can be right.

105
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,640
<3-14,Stuart>我尽力而为吧
<3-14,Stuart>Well, I'll do what I can,

106
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,210
<3-14,Stuart>但我可不敢打包票一定能找到
<3-14,Stuart>but I can't make any promises.

107
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,160
<3-15,Bernadette>其实我在制药公司工作呢
<3-15,Bernadette>You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company.

108
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,900
<3-15,Bernadette>如果你今天能帮我找到书
<3-15,Bernadette>If you can make this happen today,

109
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,400
<3-15,Bernadette>我就能帮你搞点抗焦虑
<3-15,Bernadette>I can hook you up with anxiety medication,

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,210
<3-15,Bernadette>-和抗抑郁的药  -是吗
<3-15,Bernadette>- antidepressants. - Really?

111
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,690
<3-16,Stuart>那你有这些药吗
<3-16,Stuart>Do you have any of these?

112
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,130
<4-1,Amy>鼠脑君  你好吗
<4-1,Amy>Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,740
<4-1,Amy>没了身体的其他部分
<4-1,Amy>Not so bitey without the rest of the rat

114
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,720
<4-1,Amy>现在没法咬我了吧
<4-1,Amy>to back us up now, are we?

115
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,970
<4-2,Howard>有人吗
<4-2,Howard>Anybody home?

116
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,000
<4-3,Amy>你俩来干什么
<4-3,Amy>Hey, what brings you guys here?

117
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,240
<4-4,Raj>我们要去吃午饭
<4-4,Raj>Well, we were just on our way to lunch

118
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,490
<4-4,Raj>顺道看看你想不想一起去
<4-4,Raj>and wanted to see if you'd like to join.

119
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,290
<4-4,Raj>为什么
<4-4,Raj>Why?

120
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,550
<4-5,Amy>因为这周谢尔顿不上班
<4-5,Amy>Because Sheldon's not here this week,

121
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,030
<4-5,Amy>你们就觉得我没有别人陪伴了吗
<4-5,Amy>and you don't think I have any other options?

122
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,080
<4-5,Amy>开玩笑的  我拿上包就走
<4-5,Amy>I'm just kidding. I'll get my purse.

123
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,090
<4-6,Bert>艾米  我
<4-6,Bert>Hi, Amy. I... Oh.

124
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,080
<4-6,Bert>抱歉  我不知道你有客人在
<4-6,Bert>I'm sorry. I didn't know you had any company.

125
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,910
<4-6,Bert>没关系
<4-6,Bert>That's okay.

<4-12,Bert>You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?

134
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,080
<4-13,Howard>你们都喜欢石头[摇滚]吗
<4-13,Howard>You're both into rock?

137
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,470
<4-15,Amy>你忘了把石英拿走了
<4-15,Amy>Oh, you forgot your quartz.

138
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,110
<4-15,Amy>没关系
<4-15,Amy>Oh, it's okay.

139

<4-16,Bert>送给你吧
<4-16,Bert>I want you to have it.

140
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,030
<4-16,Bert>再见
<4-16,Bert>Bye.

141
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,920
<4-17,Amy>他人真好
<4-17,Amy>He's nice.

142
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,820
<4-18,Howard>他对你好是因为他喜欢你
<4-18,Howard>Yeah, he's nice because he likes you.

143
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,360
<4-19,Amy>什么呀  他才不喜欢我呢
<4-19,Amy>What?! No, he doesn't.

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,090
<4-20,Raj>他送你一块漂亮的石头
<4-20,Raj>He brought you a pretty rock.

145
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,800
<4-21,Amy>那又怎样  他每天都送我...
<4-21,Amy>So? He does that every day...Oh.

146
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,820
<4-22,Howard>如果你不想吃午饭
<4-22,Howard>You know, if you'd rather skip lunch

147
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,570
<4-22,Howard>而想和你男友伯特在一起  我们完全没意见
<4-22,Howard>and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it's totally okay.

148
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,940
<4-23,Amy>他才不是我男朋友呢
<4-23,Amy>He's not my boyfriend.

149
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,910
<4-24,Raj>你确定吗  他个高  肤白  人怪
<4-24,Raj>Are you sure? He's tall, pale and awkward.

150
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,990
<4-24,Raj>貌似就是你的菜啊
<4-24,Raj>That sounds like your type.

151
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,560
<4-25,Amy>你这种万年没人爱的家伙也敢来取笑我吗
<4-25,Amy>Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?

152
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,990
<4-26,Raj>没错  霍华德  你成熟点好不好
<4-26,Raj>Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

153
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,060
<4-27,Amy>我该怎么做呢  我不想伤害他的感情
<4-27,Amy>What do I do? I don't want to hurt his feelings.

154
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,460
<4-28,Howard>也许问题就出在他不知道你名花有主了
<4-28,Howard>Maybe the problem is he thinks you're available.

155
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,160
<4-28,Howard>他知道你在跟谢尔顿谈恋爱吗
<4-28,Howard>Does he know you're dating Sheldon?

156
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,490
<4-29,Amy>好像从没提过这事
<4-29,Amy>I guess it hasn't come up.

157
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,160
<4-30,Howard>看吧
<4-30,Howard>There you go.

158
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,030
<4-31,Raj>那谢尔顿知道你们俩是算在谈恋爱吗
<4-31,Raj>And does Sheldon know you're dating Sheldon?

159
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,070
<4-32,Amy>不好意思  那你又是跟谁在恋爱
<4-32,Amy>I'm sorry. Who are you dating?

160
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,390
<4-33,Raj>就是  把嘴闭上  霍华德
<4-33,Raj>Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

161
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,290
<5-1,Penny>谢尔顿
<5-1,Penny>Hey, Sheldon.

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,720
<5-4,Sheldon>我在上班  你觉得呢
<5-4,Sheldon>I'm on vacation. What do you think?

165
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,730
<5-5,Penny>那你为什么坐在楼梯上
<5-5,Penny>Why are you sitting in the stairwell?

166
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,920
<5-6,Sheldon>莱纳德让我待在这
<5-6,Sheldon>Leonard told me to stay.

167
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,010
<5-7,Penny>真听话  乖孩子[狗狗]
<5-7,Penny>Oh. Well, good boy.

<5-9,Penny>寄给不同的经济人
<5-9,Penny>send them off to agents

172
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,240
<5-9,Penny>然后去报一门新的表演课
<5-9,Penny>and sign up for a new acting class and...

173
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,770
<5-10,Sheldon>-祝你忙得开心  -好的
<5-10,Sheldon>- Well, have fun. - Okay.

<5-11,Penny>-你要不要一起来  -可以吗
<5-11,Penny>- You want to come with me? - Really?

175
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,990
<5-13,Penny>当然可以  走吧  快  乖孩子[狗狗]
<5-13,Penny>Come on, boy. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

176
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,860
<5-13,Penny>快上车  走
<5-13,Penny>Get in the car. Come on.

177
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,200
<6-1,Stuart (on phone)>谢天谢地
<6-1,Stuart (on phone)>All right, thanks a lot.

178
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,870
<6-1,Stuart (on phone)>首都漫画店有一本
<6-1,Stuart (on phone)>They have one at Capital Comics.

179
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,870
<6-2,Bernadette>-那太棒了  -才不是
<6-2,Bernadette>- Oh, that's great. - No, it's not.

180
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,440
<6-3,Stuart>我讨厌那地方
<6-3,Stuart>I hate that place.

181
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,510
<6-3,Stuart>那个店主就是一个混蛋
<6-3,Stuart>Guy who owns it is a jerk.

182
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,810
<6-3,Stuart>他总爱让我产生强烈的自卑感
<6-3,Stuart>He's always making me feel bad about myself.

183
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,510
<6-4,Bernadette>太糟糕了
<6-4,Bernadette>Oh, that's terrible.

184
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,260
<6-4,Bernadette>那家店在哪里
<6-4,Bernadette>What's the address?

185
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,710
<6-5,Stuart>算了  要不我带你去吧
<6-5,Stuart>You know, why don't I just take you there?

186
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,490
<6-5,Stuart>这样我能确保他不会趁机敲诈
<6-5,Stuart>That way, I can make sure he doesn't rip you off.

187
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,410
<6-6,Bernadette>多谢啦  但我不希望你关门
<6-6,Bernadette>Oh, thanks, but I don't want you to close up.

188
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,600
<6-6,Bernadette>你会损失客人的
<6-6,Bernadette>I mean, won't you lose business?

189
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,370
<6-6,Bernadette>抱歉  这话太损了
<6-6,Bernadette>Sorry. That was mean.

190
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,400
<7-1,Amy>-佩妮真的辞掉了服务员的工作吗  -是的
<7-1,Amy>- Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory? - Yeah.

191
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,740
<7-3,Howard>-那她今天干什么  -我不知道
<7-3,Howard>- So, what is she doing today? - I don't know.

192
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,200
<7-4,Leonard>她已经认为我在这方面不支持她
<7-4,Leonard>She already thinks I don't support this,

193
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,680
<7-4,Leonard>所以如果我打给她  就会像查岗一样
<7-4,Leonard>so if I call, it might look like I'm checking up on her.

194
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,860
<7-5,Raj>那你支持她吗
<7-5,Raj>Well, do you support this?

195
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,130
<7-6,Leonard>当然支持
<7-6,Leonard>Of course I do.

196
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,470
<7-6,Leonard>她是一名很棒的女演员
<7-6,Leonard>She's a great actress.

197
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,380
<7-6,Leonard>她敢冒这个险  真让我感到骄傲
<7-6,Leonard>I'm proud she's taking this risk.

198
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,310
<7-7,Amy>你真贴心
<7-7,Amy>That's nice.

199
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,800
<7-8,Leonard>你还真信啊  太棒了
<7-8,Leonard>You bought that? Great!

200
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,200
<7-8,Leonard>我要在忘记怎么演之前  赶快打给佩妮
<7-8,Leonard>I got to call her before I forget how I said it.

201
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,920
<7-9,Penny>怎么了
<7-9,Penny>Hi. What's up?

202
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,690
<7-10,Leonard>进展如何
<7-10,Leonard>Oh, how's it going?

203
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,130
<7-10,Leonard>你有没有袭卷好莱坞啊
<7-10,Leonard>You taking Hollywood by storm?

204
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,770
<7-11,Penny>其实我现在在芝士蛋糕工厂呢
<7-11,Penny>Actually, I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.

205
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,190
<7-12,Leonard>你要回工作啦  那真是太好了
<7-12,Leonard>You got your job back. That is great news.

206
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,700
<7-12,Leonard>我本来不想多说什么
<7-12,Leonard>I didn't want to say anything,

207
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,320
<7-12,Leonard>但你这么做才是正确的
<7-12,Leonard>but you are making the right choice.

208
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,650
<7-12,Leonard>现在就切断自己的经济来源
<7-12,Leonard>To plunge yourself into debt right now

209
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,900
<7-12,Leonard>-简直就是疯了嘛  -是啊
<7-12,Leonard>- would be literally insane. Yeah.

210
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,460
<7-13,Penny>我是来这还工作服的
<7-13,Penny>I'm just returning my uniform.

211
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,820
<7-13,Penny>对了  我支持你哦
<7-13,Penny>And I support you.

212
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,340
<8-1,Voice>在开始接受冥想引导前
<8-1,Voice>Before we begin your guided meditation,

213
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,200
<8-1,Voice>闭上眼
<8-1,Voice>close your eyes

214
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,700
<8-1,Voice>想象自己处于一个平和安详的环境
<8-1,Voice>and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.

215
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,720
<8-1,Voice>好的
<8-1,Voice>Okay.

216
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,490
<8-2,Sheldon>我处于欧洲核子研究中心的超级对撞机里
<8-2,Sheldon>I'm inside the CERN super collider.

217
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,730
<8-3,Voice>现在用鼻子轻松地深吸一口气
<8-3,Voice>Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose.

218
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,290
<8-3,Voice>然后呼气
<8-3,Voice>And let it out.

219
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,090
<8-4,Sheldon>真是"没想到"啊
<8-4,Sheldon>Didn't see that coming.

220
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,690
<8-5,Voice>吸气
<8-5,Voice>In.

221
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,800
<8-6,Sheldon>下一步肯定是...
<8-6,Sheldon>Let me guess.

222
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,560
<8-7,Voice>呼气
<8-7,Voice>And out.

223
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,590
<8-8,Sheldon>不然咧  连吸两口气憋死自己吗
<8-8,Sheldon>What was I gonna do? Two "ins" in a row?

224
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,120
<8-8,Sheldon>我的柠檬汁呢
<8-8,Sheldon>Where's my lemonade?

225
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,790
<8-9,Penny>我忘了
<8-9,Penny>I didn't get it.

226
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,890
<8-10,Sheldon>告别你服务员职业生涯的最佳方式
<8-10,Sheldon>A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress

227
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,840
<8-10,Sheldon>就是最后一次忘记我的点单
<8-10,Sheldon>to forget my order one last time.

228
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,280
<8-11,Penny>你认为我辞职是个错误吗
<8-11,Penny>Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?

229
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,870
<8-12,Sheldon>你有看到我在喝柠檬汁吗
<8-12,Sheldon>Do you see me drinking lemonade?

230
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,320
<8-13,Penny>我是说真的
<8-13,Penny>No. I'm serious.

231
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,340
<8-14,Sheldon>干嘛这么问
<8-14,Sheldon>Why do you ask?

232
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,610
<8-15,Penny>因为莱纳德刚刚气到我了
<8-15,Penny>Because Leonard just pissed me off.

233
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,780
<8-15,Penny>我辞职是不是特傻啊
<8-15,Penny>Am I being an idiot or not?

234
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,250
<8-16,Sheldon>不啊  我不这么认为
<8-16,Sheldon>No, I don't think you are.

235
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,610
<8-17,Penny>真的吗
<8-17,Penny>Really?

236
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,550
<8-18,Sheldon>达到目标的最好办法就是投入自己
<8-18,Sheldon>The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100%

237
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,910
<8-18,Sheldon>百分之百的时间和精力
<8-18,Sheldon>of your time and energy to it.

238
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,050
<8-18,Sheldon>当我决心要成为一个物理学家时
<8-18,Sheldon>When I decided I was going to be a physicist,

239
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,590
<8-18,Sheldon>我没有随便找一份工作
<8-18,Sheldon>I didn't take some other job

240
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,510
<8-18,Sheldon>好给自己留一条后路
<8-18,Sheldon>in case it didn't work out.

241
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,530
<8-18,Sheldon>这决定不容易  因为那年皮尔森老师
<8-18,Sheldon>Which wasn't easy because there was a lot of pressure

242
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,900
<8-18,Sheldon>不断对我施压  让我当补粉笔专员
<8-18,Sheldon>from Ms. Pierson for me to be chalk monitor that year.

243

<8-19,Penny>Why can't Leonard understand it?

245
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,080
<8-20,Sheldon>因为他不像咱俩  佩妮
<8-20,Sheldon>Because he's not like us, Penny.

<8-21,Penny>when I leave you in the car.

249

<9-2,Amy>你好  伯特

<9-4,Amy>听着  伯特
<9-4,Amy>Listen, um, Bert,

253
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,220
<9-4,Amy>在你说出口之前  我想告诉你
<9-4,Amy>before you say anything else, I...

254
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,400
<9-4,Amy>我有男朋友了
<9-4,Amy>I have a boyfriend.

255
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,940
<9-5,Bert>这下尴尬了
<9-5,Bert>This is awkward.

256
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,690
<9-5,Bert>你以为我是邀请你跟我一起
<9-5,Bert>You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me

257
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,340
<9-6,Amy>-去看展览吗  -难道不是吗
<9-6,Amy>to the mineral show. - Weren't you?

258
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,340
<9-7,Bert>是的
<9-7,Bert>Yeah.

259
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,370
<9-8,Amy>多谢你的好意  但
<9-8,Amy>That's very nice of you, but...

260
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,400
<9-8,Amy>我的确有男朋友了
<9-8,Amy>I do have a boyfriend.

261
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,060
<9-9,Bert>你们都这么说
<9-9,Bert>That's what you all say.

262
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,260
<9-9,Bert>你们只是不想跟我出去约会
<9-9,Bert>You just don't want to go out with me

263
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,420
<9-9,Bert>因为我是个令人讨厌的人
<9-9,Bert>because I have an off-putting personality.

264
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,100
<9-10,Amy>不  不是的
<9-10,Amy>No, that's not true.

265
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,630
<9-10,Amy>我的男朋友也是一个让人讨厌的人
<9-10,Amy>My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too.

266
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,820
<9-10,Amy>而且比你讨厌多了
<9-10,Amy>Like, way worse than you.

267
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,860
<9-11,Bert>别担心
<9-11,Bert>Don't worry.

268
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,990
<9-11,Bert>我习惯了
<9-11,Bert>I'm used to it.

269
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,670
<9-11,Bert>我这么大只  个性古怪  长相奇怪
<9-11,Bert>I mean, I'm big and weird and funny-looking

270
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,310
<9-11,Bert>从来不会有人想跟我一起玩
<9-11,Bert>and no one ever wants to do anything with me.

271
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,730
<9-12,Amy>别那样说
<9-12,Amy>Don't say that.

272
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,270
<9-12,Amy>没关系
<9-12,Amy>It's okay.

273
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,050
<9-13,Bert>我知道我就是一怪物
<9-13,Bert>I know I'm a monster.

274
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,410
<9-14,Amy>不  伯特  别走
<9-14,Amy>No, Bert, come on.

275
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,520
<9-14,Amy>我很乐意陪你去看矿物展
<9-14,Amy>I'd love to go to the mineral show with you.

276
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,510
<9-15,Bert>太棒了
<9-15,Bert>Sweet.

277
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,400
<9-15,Bert>那就算约会啦
<9-15,Bert>It's a date.

278
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,190
<9-16,Amy>才不算呢
<9-16,Amy>No, it's not.

279
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,840
<9-17,Bert>为时已晚啦
<9-17,Bert>Too late!

280
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,640
<10-2,Stuart>自从那辆韩国教堂大巴
<10-2,Stuart>Yeah. Haven't seen this many people in my store

281
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,200
<10-2,Stuart>从我店前门玻璃撞进来后
<10-2,Stuart>since that Korean church bus

282
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,370
<10-2,Stuart>我店再也没有见过那么多人
<10-2,Stuart>crashed through my front window.

283
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,050
<10-3,Jesse>斯图尔特
<10-3,Jesse>Hey! Stuart!

284
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,990
<10-4,Stuart>杰西
<10-4,Stuart>Jesse.

285
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,830
<10-5,Jesse>好久不见
<10-5,Jesse>Haven't seen you in forever.

286
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,480
<10-5,Jesse>你看你都灰成这样了
<10-5,Jesse>Look how gray you've gotten.

287
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,790
<10-6,Stuart>我的头发一直都是这个颜色
<10-6,Stuart>My hair's exactly the same color as always.

288
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,350
<10-7,Jesse>不  我是在说你的肤色
<10-7,Jesse>No, I was talking about your skin.

289
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,670
<10-8,Stuart>我的朋友要找一本漫画书
<10-8,Stuart>Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book...

290
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,300
<10-9,Jesse>她应该是无意走进你的店吧
<10-9,Jesse>And she went into your store by mistake.

291
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,850
<10-9,Jesse>幸好他家店没人  不会有人知道你走错地方
<10-9,Jesse>Good thing there was no one there to see you.

292
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,730
<10-9,Jesse>你要找什么
<10-9,Jesse>What do you need?

293
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,870
<10-9,Jesse>这本啊  我这里有
<10-9,Jesse>Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.

294
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,690
<10-9,Jesse>就在这边
<10-9,Jesse>Right over here.

295

<10-10,Stuart>运动裤肥仔  连你也抛弃我
<10-10,Stuart>Even you, Sweatpants?

296
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,000
<10-11,Sweatpants>这里有免费爆米花呢
<10-11,Sweatpants>Free popcorn.

297
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,840
<10-12,Jesse>要不要来一杯咖啡
<10-12,Jesse>Can I offer you a coffee?

298
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,330
<10-12,Jesse>是浓缩咖啡还是拿铁呢
<10-12,Jesse>Espresso? Latte?

299
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,050
<10-13,Bernadette>不用了  谢谢
<10-13,Bernadette>No, thanks.

300
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,230
<10-14,Jesse>你呢  斯图  摩卡还是司康饼
<10-14,Jesse>How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone?

301
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,730
<10-14,Jesse>还是要这附近施舍处的地址啊
<10-14,Jesse>Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?

302
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,070
<10-16,Jesse>他知道施舍处在哪
<10-16,Jesse>He knows where the soup kitchen is.

303
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,050
<10-17,Stuart>在默顿大道上
<10-17,Stuart>It's on Merton Avenue.

304
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,790
<10-18,Bernadette>我不喜欢你这样对待我的朋友
<10-18,Bernadette>I don't think I like the way you're treating my friend.

305
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,210
<10-18,Bernadette>抱歉
<10-18,Bernadette>Sorry.

306
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,730
<10-19,Jesse>你还想不想要这本书了
<10-19,Jesse>You want the book or not?

307
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,060
<10-20,Bernadette>想要也不买你的
<10-20,Bernadette>Not from you.

308
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,130
<10-20,Bernadette>我们走  斯图尔特
<10-20,Bernadette>Let's go, Stuart.

309
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,950
<10-21,Stuart>你知道吗  杰西
<10-21,Stuart>You know something, Jesse?

310
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,210
<10-21,Stuart>虽说你生意兴隆
<10-21,Stuart>You may have a successful business

311
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,070
<10-21,Stuart>均衡营养
<10-21,Stuart>a-and the kind of pink complexion

312
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,260
<10-21,Stuart>养得一脸粉嫩
<10-21,Stuart>that comes with good nutrition...

313
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,280
<10-21,Stuart>但我拥有更重要的东西
<10-21,Stuart>...but I have something more important.

314
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,850
<10-22,Jesse>是什么
<10-22,Jesse>What's that?

315
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,890
<10-23,Stuart>友谊
<10-23,Stuart>Friendship.

316
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,760
<10-23,Stuart>但我会毫不犹豫放弃友谊来换取这一切
<10-23,Stuart>Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.

317
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,170
<10-23,Stuart>矿物岩石展览
<10-23,Stuart>The mineral and rock show?

318
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,490
<11-1,Howard>即使不跟伯特去  听着都很没劲
<11-1,Howard>That would be awful even without Bert.

319
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,100
<11-2,Amy>那我现在应该怎么办
<11-2,Amy>So what am I supposed to do now?

320
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,680
<11-3,Raj>让你的子宫为他的巨人婴儿做好准备
<11-3,Raj>Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?

321
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,490
<11-4,Amy>不许拿这事开玩笑
<11-4,Amy>This isn't funny.

322
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,810
<11-4,Amy>我必须跟他说实话
<11-4,Amy>I'm gonna have to tell him the truth:

323
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,350
<11-4,Amy>就算我没有男友
<11-4,Amy>that even if I didn't have a boyfriend,

324
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,930
<11-4,Amy>也不会喜欢他
<11-4,Amy>I wouldn't be interested in him.

325
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,100
<11-5,Howard>这话我听过太多遍了
<11-5,Howard>I've heard those words so many times.

326
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,290
<11-5,Howard>琳达·诺森恰克  谭米·罗森沃塞尔
<11-5,Howard>From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel...

327
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,110
<11-6,Raj>帕德玛·卡普尔  内哈·恰德瑞
<11-6,Raj>Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

328
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,850
<11-7,Howard>马茜·格罗斯曼  莉萨·马扎里诺
<11-7,Howard>...Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino...

329
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,700
<11-8,Raj>-梅根·平卡斯  -谭米·周
<11-8,Raj>- ...Megan Pincus... - ...Tammy Cho...

330
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,020
<11-10,Raj>我们常去那家星巴克的女生叫什么来着
<11-10,Raj>Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?

331
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,000
<11-11,Howard>-艾琳·罗素  -没错  艾琳
<11-11,Howard>- Arlene Russel! - Yes! Arlene!

332
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,240
<11-12,Raj>她在我俩的卡布奇诺杯上  都写上了"不可能"
<11-12,Raj>She wrote "no way" on both our cappuccinos.

333
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,450
<11-13,Howard>可怜的伯特
<11-13,Howard>Poor Bert.

334
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,080
<11-13,Howard>有一个悲催的下午在等着他
<11-13,Howard>That guy's got a rough afternoon ahead of him.

335
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,970
<11-14,Amy>你们希望一个女生
<11-14,Amy>Well, how would you want a girl

336
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,970
<11-14,Amy>如何拒绝你们
<11-14,Amy>to tell you she wasn't interested?

337
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,910
<11-15,Raj>我希望她和我好好坐着
<11-15,Raj>I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me down,

338
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,040
<11-15,Raj>看着我的眼睛说
<11-15,Raj>look me in the eye and say,

339
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,780
<11-15,Raj>"我错了  我爱你"
<11-15,Raj>"I was wrong. I love you."

340
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,440
<11-15,Raj>或许再用上特别的方式爱抚我
<11-15,Raj>And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.

341
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,150
<11-16,Howard>没错  拒绝男生就要这样
<11-16,Howard>That's how you reject a guy.

342
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,640
<11-17,Amy>我没时间听你俩瞎掰
<11-17,Amy>Okay, I don't have time for this.

343
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,190
<11-17,Amy>我要直接去找他  残忍地说出真相算了
<11-17,Amy>I'm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.

344
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,850
<11-19,Raj>-别这样  -他会很伤心的
<11-19,Raj>- No, don't. - He'll be so upset.

345
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,350
<11-19,Raj>他很可能会爬上帝国大厦
<11-19,Raj>He'll probably climb up the Empire State Building

346
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,420
<11-19,Raj>像电影里的金刚一样乱拍飞机泄愤
<11-19,Raj>and start swatting at planes.

347
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,400
<11-20,Howard>要我们帮你说吗
<11-20,Howard>You want us to talk to him?

348
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,440
<11-20,Howard>可以吗
<11-20,Howard>Really?

349
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,020
<11-21,Amy>-你们愿意代劳吗  -当然
<11-21,Amy>- You would do that? - Sure.

350
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,160
<11-22,Raj>我们都曾有过这样的经历
<11-22,Raj>We've both been in his shoes.

351
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,130
<11-22,Raj>我们会让他失望的同时  感觉到同情与尊重
<11-22,Raj>We'll let him down with compassion and respect.

352
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,790
<11-23,Amy>谢谢
<11-23,Amy>Thank you.

353
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,830
<11-24,Howard>我们走
<11-24,Howard>Let's go.

354
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,770
<11-25,Raj>跟他说她是拉拉吗
<11-25,Raj>So we tell him she's a lesbian, right?

355
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,190
<11-26,Howard>当然是说她是拉拉啦
<11-26,Howard>Of course we tell him she's a lesbian.

356
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,240
<12-1,Penny>保持三
<12-1,Penny>And hold three...

357
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,080
<12-1,Penny>二  一
<12-1,Penny>two... one.

358
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,020
<12-1,Penny>非常好
<12-1,Penny>Very good.

359
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,570
<12-1,Penny>现在试试战士二式
<12-1,Penny>Now let's try Warrior II.

360
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,580
<12-1,Penny>保持
<12-1,Penny>And hold.

361
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,110
<12-2,Sheldon>有报道指出有些伟大的瑜伽修行者
<12-2,Sheldon>I've read that there are great yogis

362
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,480
<12-2,Sheldon>可以随心所欲掌控自己的身体
<12-2,Sheldon>who have such mastery over their bodies

363
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,290
<12-2,Sheldon>他们能通过生殖器汲水
<12-2,Sheldon>they can draw water in through their genitals.

364
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,170
<12-3,Penny>我们今天还不会练到这一层次
<12-3,Penny>Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna get to do that today.

365
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,470
<12-3,Penny>太遗憾了
<12-3,Penny>Too bad.

366
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,130
<12-4,Sheldon>感觉用这种办法喝奶昔不错
<12-4,Sheldon>It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake

367
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,690
<12-4,Sheldon>至少大脑不会冰到痛
<12-4,Sheldon>without getting brain freeze.

368
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,580
<12-6,Penny>现在是反转战士式
<12-6,Penny>And now we go to Reverse Warrior.

369
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,060
<12-7,Leonard>她是怎么说服你做瑜伽的
<12-7,Leonard>How did she get you to do yoga?

370
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,320
<12-8,Sheldon>说实话  我以为她说的是"尤达"
<12-8,Sheldon>Well, to be honest, I thought she said "Yoda."

372
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,630
<12-9,Penny>我在帮他放松  因为他和你不同
<12-9,Penny>I'm helping him relax because, unlike you,

373
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,130
<12-9,Penny>他支持我
<12-9,Penny>he supports me.

374
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,140
<12-10,Leonard>究竟要我说多少次啊
<12-10,Leonard>Oh, how many times do I have to say it?

375
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,770
<12-10,Leonard>我支持你
<12-10,Leonard>I support you.

376
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,280
<12-11,Penny>谢尔顿  休息下
<12-11,Penny>Sheldon, take a break.

377
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,190
<12-12,Sheldon>合十致敬
<12-12,Sheldon>Namaste.

378
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,300
<12-13,Penny>如果你支持我  那通电话是什么意思
<12-13,Penny>Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?

379
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,860
<12-14,Leonard>好吧  我不确定你是否该辞职
<12-14,Leonard>Fine. I'm not sure you should have quit.

380
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,310
<12-14,Leonard>但如果你这么在乎我的想法
<12-14,Leonard>But if you care so much what I think,

381
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,010
<12-14,Leonard>你为什么不在辞职前问我呢
<12-14,Leonard>why didn't you ask me before you did it?

382
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,600
<12-15,Penny>所以现在我做事需要你的批准吗
<12-15,Penny>Oh, so now I need your permission?

383
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,120
<12-15,Penny>你在辞职前会征求我的意见吗
<12-15,Penny>Would you have asked me before you quit your job?

384
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,090
<12-15,Penny>当然会
<12-15,Penny>Yes.

385
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,620
<12-16,Leonard>我觉得我们的关系已经到了
<12-16,Leonard>I thought we were in the kind of relationship

386
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,970
<12-16,Leonard>什么事都一起做决定的阶段
<12-16,Leonard>where we make decisions together.

387
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,590
<12-16,Leonard>如果我错了  那也许我们应该谈谈
<12-16,Leonard>If I'm wrong, then maybe we need to talk about

388
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,410
<12-16,Leonard>我们的关系究竟在哪一阶段
<12-16,Leonard>the kind of relationship we're actually in.

389
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,840
<12-17,Penny>也许是需要谈谈了
<12-17,Penny>Yeah, well, maybe we do.

390
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,220
<12-18,Sheldon>你们想谈的话  我也很乐意谈
<12-18,Sheldon>I'm willing to if you guys are.

391
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,370
<12-19,Leonard>给我们一些空间好吗
<12-19,Leonard>Can we please have some privacy?

392
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,630
<12-20,Sheldon>不行
<12-20,Sheldon>Y... No.

393
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,830
<12-20,Sheldon>除了你们俩  我也是这段关系的一名成员
<12-20,Sheldon>I'm as much a part of this relationship as you two,

394
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,560
<12-20,Sheldon>我觉得是时候大家把话说开了
<12-20,Sheldon>and I think it's high time we put all our cards on the table.

395
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,020
<12-20,Sheldon>比如  这段感情的未来在哪里
<12-20,Sheldon>Yeah. For example, where is this going?

396
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,010
<12-20,Sheldon>你们到底会不会结婚
<12-20,Sheldon>Are you two ever getting married?

397
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,090
<12-20,Sheldon>还有婚后  我们仨要住在哪里
<12-20,Sheldon>And, if so, where will we all live?

398
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,390
<12-20,Sheldon>你们有考虑这个问题吗
<12-20,Sheldon>Have you thought about that?

399
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,280
<12-22,Sheldon>-没有  -佩妮呢
<12-22,Sheldon>- No. - Penny?

400
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,770
<12-23,Penny>慢着  我们这是在干嘛
<12-23,Penny>Okay, wait. What are we doing?

401
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,820
<12-24,Leonard>不知为何  我们现在谈的是
<12-24,Leonard>For some reason, we're planning a future

402
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,910
<12-24,Leonard>我们与谢尔顿永远住在一起的未来
<12-24,Leonard>where we both live with Sheldon forever.

403
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,060
<12-25,Sheldon>很好  总算有点进展了
<12-25,Sheldon>Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

404
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,180
<12-26,Penny>我知道你觉得我太过鲁莽
<12-26,Penny>Look, I know you think I'm being reckless,

405
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,070
<12-26,Penny>也许你是对的
<12-26,Penny>and you might be right,

406
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,540
<12-26,Penny>但我需要把握这次机会
<12-26,Penny>but I need to take this shot.

407
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,630
<12-27,Sheldon>对  这是说真的
<12-27,Sheldon>Yeah, no kidding.

408
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,400
<12-27,Sheldon>尽管她在简历上造假
<12-27,Sheldon>Despite what it says on her resume,

409
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,900
<12-27,Sheldon>她早就不是22岁了
<12-27,Sheldon>she is no longer 22.

410
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,530
<12-28,Leonard>我发誓  我向来支持你
<12-28,Leonard>I swear, I am on your side.

411
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,080
<12-29,Penny>你总是口头上说支持我
<12-29,Penny>You keep saying you're on my side,

412
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,370
<12-30,Sheldon>-而你的言行完全不一致  -他对我也是这样
<12-30,Sheldon>- but you don't act like it. - He does that to me, too.

413
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,960
<12-30,Sheldon>我们为什么要容忍你这种行为
<12-30,Sheldon>Why do we put up with it?

414
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,980
<12-31,Leonard>听我说  我永远做不到你现在做的事
<12-31,Leonard>Listen, I could never do what you're doing, okay?

415
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,670
<12-31,Leonard>我没这么大胆
<12-31,Leonard>I would be terrified.

416
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,090
<12-32,Penny>其实我心里也很害怕
<12-32,Penny>Well, it's scary for me, too.

417
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,030
<12-33,Sheldon>我还好啦
<12-33,Sheldon>I'm fine with it.

418
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,180
<12-34,Leonard>我的意思是  不能因为我做不到
<12-34,Leonard>My point is, just because I couldn't do it

419
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,550
<12-34,Leonard>就代表你不应该去做
<12-34,Leonard>doesn't mean you shouldn't.

420
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,580
<12-34,Leonard>我为你骄傲
<12-34,Leonard>And I'm proud of you.

421
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,140
<12-35,Penny>好的  谢谢
<12-35,Penny>Okay. Thank you.

<12-36,Sheldon>为了庆祝重归于好

<13-2,Bernadette>and he's a much nicer person than you are,

429
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,210

<13-3,Jesse>Oh, you want a latte while you wait?

433
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,040
<13-4,Bernadette>不  我才不要拿铁
<13-4,Bernadette>No, I don't want a latte!
