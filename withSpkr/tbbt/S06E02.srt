00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,310
<1-3,Amy>他说他还在上面刻字了
<1-3,Amy>He told me he had it engraved.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,190
<1-4,Bernadette>"如不幸离婚

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,210
<1-7,Penny>恶心  为什么呀
<1-7,Penny>Ew, why?

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,910
<1-8,Amy>我一直想要一副人体骨架
<1-8,Amy>'Cause I've always wanted a whole human skeleton

<1-8,Amy>and they are really spendy.

15
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,420
<1-9,Bernadette>所以  你真的觉得你和谢尔顿会有天结婚吗
<1-9,Bernadette>So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,760
<1-10,Amy>不是有天
<1-10,Amy>Not just someday.

<1-10,Amy>确切说来是四年后
<1-10,Amy>In exactly four years.

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,710
<1-10,Amy>但先别给谢尔顿漏口风
<1-10,Amy>But don't tell Sheldon.

00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,630
<1-10,Amy>他还是只会飞的鸭子呢

<1-13,Bernadette>你觉得你会跟莱纳德结婚吗
<1-13,Bernadette>Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?

<1-14,Penny>这个嘛
<1-14,Penny>Oh, well, you know,

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,430
<1-14,Penny>莱纳德是个好男人

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,710
<1-15,Bernadette>你觉得你们会结婚吗

00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,340
<1-16,Penny>他很贴心哦
<1-16,Penny>He's a sweetie.

27
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,060
<1-17,Amy>你在顾左右而言他
<1-17,Amy>You're not answering the question.

28
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,100
<1-17,Amy>你爱他吗
<1-17,Amy>Do you love him?

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,700
<1-18,Penny>当然  我当然爱他啊
<1-18,Penny>Yeah, sure, of course I love him.

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,870
<1-19,Bernadette>听起来不太像啊
<1-19,Bernadette>It doesn't sound like it.

31
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,930
<1-20,Penny>但我的确爱他啊
<1-20,Penny>Well, I do.

32
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,790
<1-21,Bernadette>你有对他说吗
<1-21,Bernadette>Do you tell him that?

33
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,710
<1-22,Penny>没  他一定会理解错的
<1-22,Penny>No, he'd just take it the wrong way.

34
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,150
<1-23,Amy>你什么意思
<1-23,Amy>What does that mean?

35
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,980
<1-24,Penny>我的意思是他很特别  有才  人好
<1-24,Penny>It means he is special and smart and nice and...

36
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,160
<1-25,Bernadette>-你要跟他分手啦  -没有啊
<1-25,Bernadette>- Are you gonna break up with him? - No!

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,230
<1-26,Penny>可能吧  我也不知道
<1-26,Penny>Maybe. I don't know.

38
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,090
<1-27,Bernadette>我不知道原来你爱得不开心
<1-27,Bernadette>I had no idea you were unhappy.

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,140
<1-28,Penny>重点就在这  我没有不开心
<1-28,Penny>That's the thing: I'm not.

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,810
<1-28,Penny>我完全没有不开心  只是...
<1-28,Penny>I'm not unhappy at all. It's just... I don't know...

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,990
<1-28,Penny>我以前也爱过  但感觉跟现在不一样
<1-28,Penny>I-I've been in love before, but it felt different.

42
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,470
<1-28,Penny>这可能是一段全新更好  但无聊的爱情
<1-28,Penny>But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love.

43
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,640
<1-28,Penny>你对霍华德有过这种感觉吗
<1-28,Penny>Do you ever feel that way about Howard?

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,530
<1-29,Bernadette>拿我男人跟你男人比不太公平啊
<1-29,Bernadette>Oh, that's not really a fair comparison.

45
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,450
<1-29,Bernadette>我嫁的可是性感版的巴斯光年
<1-29,Bernadette>I'm basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.

46
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,600
<1-30,Penny>艾米  你呢
<1-30,Penny>Amy, you?

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,590
<1-31,Amy>这我也回答不了
<1-31,Amy>Can't help ya, kid.

48
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,750
<1-31,Amy>待在谢尔顿身边的每分每秒
<1-31,Amy>Whenever I'm around Sheldon,

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,920
<1-31,Amy>胯下都如同火焰在烧
<1-31,Amy>I feel like my loins are on fire.

50
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,180
<1-31,Amy>是欲火
<1-31,Amy>In the good way.

51
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,740
<1-31,Amy>不是尿路感染的灼烧感
<1-31,Amy>Not the urinary tract infection way.

<2-2,Howard>You don't have to shout, Raj.

55
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,300
<2-2,Howard>我又不是什么飘浮在外太空的宇航员
<2-2,Howard>It's not like I'm an astronaut floating around in outer space.

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,180
<2-2,Howard>不对  我还真是啊
<2-2,Howard>Oh, wait, I am.

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,100
<2-3,Leonard>那里是否就像你梦想中那样
<2-3,Leonard>So, is it everything you hoped it would be?

58
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,340
<2-3,Leonard>棒多了
<2-3,Leonard>It's better.

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,160
<2-4,Howard>每早醒来  我还是不敢相信
<2-4,Howard>I wake up every morning and I just can't believe

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,550
<2-4,Howard>我有幸来到这美妙的旅途上
<2-4,Howard>I'm on this incredible adventure.

68
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,750
<2-9,Howard>就像在兄弟会一样
<2-9,Howard>It's kind of like being in a frat.

69
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,090
<2-9,Howard>打打闹闹  伤害一下对方心灵
<2-9,Howard>You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.

82
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,990
<2-17,Howard>你疯了吧  谢尔顿
<2-17,Howard>You're out of your mind, Sheldon.

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,380
<2-32,Raj>你们都带女朋友去
<2-32,Raj>You guys are bringing your girlfriends.

104
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,990
<2-33,Sheldon>问题是我以为今天会是
<2-33,Sheldon>The big deal is I was expecting us

105
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,930
<2-33,Sheldon>亲密无间的五人组
<2-33,Sheldon>to be an intimate group of five.

106
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,440
<2-33,Sheldon>现在我们就成了
<2-33,Sheldon>Now, we're going to be a...

107
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,580
<2-33,Sheldon>名都叫不出来的六人堆
<2-33,Sheldon>faceless mass of six.

108
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,940
<2-34,Leonard>没事的  就把他当成沃罗威茨吧
<2-34,Leonard>It'll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.

109
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,610
<2-35,Sheldon>你喜欢巧克力葡萄干吗
<2-35,Sheldon>Do you like Raisinets?

110
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,570
<2-36,Stuart>不喜欢也不讨厌
<2-36,Stuart>I can take them or leave them.

111
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,070
<2-37,Sheldon>看电影时  沃罗威茨总是吃巧克力葡萄干
<2-37,Sheldon>At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.

112
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,650
<2-38,Stuart>如果我吃  你会比较高兴吗
<2-38,Stuart>Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?

113
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,140
<2-39,Sheldon>你吃什么管我屁事
<2-39,Sheldon>Well, it's hardly my business what you eat,

114
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,180
<2-39,Sheldon>只要不发出噪音打扰电影
<2-39,Sheldon>as long as it doesn't crunch during the film

115
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,750
<2-39,Sheldon>并且是葡萄干就好
<2-39,Sheldon>and it's Raisinets.

116
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,600
<2-40,Stuart>好吧
<2-40,Stuart>Okay.

117
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,390
<2-40,Stuart>我们能走了吗
<2-40,Stuart>Should we go?

118
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,700
<2-41,Sheldon>等等  还有一个问题
<2-41,Sheldon>Yeah, but, one more question.

119
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,940
<2-41,Sheldon>如果你想取代沃罗威茨
<2-41,Sheldon>If you're going to replace Wolowitz,

120
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,260
<2-41,Sheldon>我还得再深入了解你一点
<2-41,Sheldon>I need to know a little more about you.

121
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,970
<2-42,Stuart>随你
<2-42,Stuart>All right.

122
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,910
<2-43,Sheldon>沃罗威茨念过麻省理工
<2-43,Sheldon>Wolowitz went to MIT.

123
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,540
<2-43,Sheldon>你的教育背景是什么
<2-43,Sheldon>What's your educational background?

124
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,210
<2-44,Stuart>我上过美术学校
<2-44,Stuart>I went to art school.

125
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,740
<2-45,Sheldon>都一样可笑  走吧
<2-45,Sheldon>Equally ridiculous. Let's go.

126
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,230
<3-1,Sheldon>这种对牵手的坚持实在太荒谬了
<3-1,Sheldon>This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.

127
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,210
<3-2,Amy>我就喜欢
<3-2,Amy>Well, I like it.

128
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:57,970
<3-3,Sheldon>你当然喜欢了
<3-3,Sheldon>Yeah, of course you do.

129
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,870
<3-3,Sheldon>你是女生  弱智的事你都喜欢
<3-3,Sheldon>You're a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.

130
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,620
<3-4,Amy>看你的电影就好
<3-4,Amy>Just watch the movie.

131
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,060
<3-5,Sheldon>真不公平
<3-5,Sheldon>It's not fair.

132
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,650
<3-5,Sheldon>佩妮就不逼莱纳德牵她手
<3-5,Sheldon>Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.

133
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,700
<3-6,Amy>那是事出有因的
<3-6,Amy>There might be a reason for that.

134
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,240
<3-7,Sheldon>手汗多
<3-7,Sheldon>Sweaty?

135
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,780
<3-7,Sheldon>不卫生
<3-7,Sheldon>Unhygienic?

136
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,010
<3-7,Sheldon>看着傻
<3-7,Sheldon>Looks dumb?

137
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,270
<3-7,Sheldon>你选一个吧
<3-7,Sheldon>Take your pick.

138
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,120
<3-8,Amy>佩妮说她不确定
<3-8,Amy>Penny said she's not sure

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,320
<3-8,Amy>自己是否还想和莱纳德继续交往
<3-8,Amy>she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.

140
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,530
<3-9,Sheldon>错了  她刚喝了他的低卡胡椒博士汽水
<3-9,Sheldon>Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.

141
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,710
<3-10,Amy>那又如何
<3-10,Amy>So?

142
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,180
<3-11,Sheldon>如果她想结束和莱纳德的情侣关系
<3-11,Sheldon>So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard,

143
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,270
<3-11,Sheldon>又怎么会去如饮佳酿一般地
<3-11,Sheldon>why on earth would she guzzle a witches' brew

144
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,090
<3-11,Sheldon>喝下他的汽水与口水呢
<3-11,Sheldon>of his soda and spit?

145
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,590
<3-12,Amy>个中缘由很复杂
<3-12,Amy>It's complicated.

146
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,910
<3-13,Sheldon>弦理论才叫复杂
<3-13,Sheldon>String theory is complicated.

147
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,700
<3-13,Sheldon>这只是令人作呕
<3-13,Sheldon>That's just yucky.

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,060
<3-13,Sheldon>想都不要想
<3-13,Sheldon>Don't get any ideas.

149
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,750
<3-13,Sheldon>好吧  就当你说的是真的
<3-13,Sheldon>All right, for the sake of argument, let's say that's true.

150
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,310
<3-13,Sheldon>佩妮为什么想结束这段关系呢
<3-13,Sheldon>Why doesn't Penny just end the relationship?

151
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,540
<3-14,Amy>她不太确定自己的感受
<3-14,Amy>She's not sure how she feels.

152
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,290
<3-14,Amy>她怎么能不确定自己的感受呢
<3-14,Amy>How can she not be sure how she feels?

153
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,600
<3-15,Sheldon>当我有感受的时候  我就很明确
<3-15,Sheldon>You know, when I have a feeling, I know it.

154
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,330
<3-15,Sheldon>火车  好喜欢
<3-15,Sheldon>Trains? Love them.

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,690
<3-15,Sheldon>剑鱼  同样喜欢
<3-15,Sheldon>Swordfish? I love them, too.

156
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,170
<3-15,Sheldon>它们可是鼻子配有利剑的鱼
<3-15,Sheldon>They're fish with a sword for a nose.

157
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,090
<3-16,Amy>无论如何  千万别告诉莱纳德
<3-16,Amy>Regardless, don't say anything to Leonard.

158
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
<3-17,Sheldon>你这是要我对
<3-17,Sheldon>Now you're asking me to keep a secret

159
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,180
<3-17,Sheldon>我的密友  同事以及室友保守秘密吗
<3-17,Sheldon>from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?

160
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,490
<3-18,Amy>没错  拜托了  佩妮知道会杀了我的
<3-18,Amy>Yes, please, Penny will kill me.

161
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,060
<3-18,Amy>好吧
<3-18,Amy>Fine.

162
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,590
<3-19,Sheldon>随便一提  保守秘密   最讨厌了
<3-19,Sheldon>FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it.

163
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,720
<3-19,Sheldon>牵手  不喜欢
<3-19,Sheldon>Hand-holding? Not a fan.

164
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,800
<3-19,Sheldon>锤头鲨  好喜欢
<3-19,Sheldon>Hammerhead shark? I love that thing.

165
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,790
<3-19,Sheldon>又是一种头上带工具的鱼哦
<3-19,Sheldon>Yeah, it's another fish with a tool on its head.

166
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
<3-20,Stuart>吃巧克力葡萄干不
<3-20,Stuart>Raisinet?

167
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,610
<3-21,Sheldon>嘘  我们正忙着看电影呢
<3-21,Sheldon>Shh, we're trying to watch the movie.

168
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,670
<3-21,Sheldon>他和我们的气场不合
<3-21,Sheldon>This is not working out with him.

169
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,080
<4-1,Leonard>你在干什么
<4-1,Leonard>What are you doing?

170
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,940
<4-2,Sheldon>我好像有牙垢堆积
<4-2,Sheldon>I think I might have tartar buildup.

171
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,440
<4-2,Sheldon>我舌头伸不到以前那么长了
<4-2,Sheldon>My tongue won't go as far forward as it used to.

172
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,130
<4-3,Leonard>也许是你的舌头缩水了
<4-3,Leonard>Maybe your tongue is shrinking.

173
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,670
<4-3,Leonard>没有
<4-3,Leonard>Nope.

174
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,140
<4-4,Sheldon (measures)>你绝对想不到这有多烦人
<4-4,Sheldon (measures)>Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.

175
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,770
<4-5,Leonard>我已经开始有所体会了
<4-5,Leonard>I'm starting to get a sense of it.

176
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,460
<4-5,Leonard>别担心  我明天带你去看牙医
<4-5,Leonard>Don't worry. I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow.

<4-6,Sheldon>你是个好人  莱纳德
<4-6,Sheldon>You're good people, Leonard.

180
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,730
<4-6,Sheldon>有件事我必须告诉你
<4-6,Sheldon>There's something I need to tell you.

181
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,740
<4-7,Leonard>说吧
<4-7,Leonard>Okay.

183
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,580

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,310
<4-10,Sheldon>我不能说出不能告诉你的原因
<4-10,Sheldon>I can't tell you why I can't tell you.

185
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,420
<4-10,Sheldon>所以我有两件事不能告诉你
<4-10,Sheldon>So I guess there's two things I can't tell you.

186
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,790
<4-11,Leonard>我真希望还有更多
<4-11,Leonard>I wish there were more.

196
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,890
<4-16,Sheldon>你知道  就像

199
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,530
<4-16,Sheldon>会有不同的感受
<4-16,Sheldon>differently than they appear to.

200
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,850
<4-16,Sheldon>又或者一段关于
<4-16,Sheldon>Or a conversation

201
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,720
<4-16,Sheldon>变形金刚的对话其实指的是
<4-16,Sheldon>about The Transformers might actually be

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,160
<4-16,Sheldon>我暂停一下以便你想一下
<4-16,Sheldon>I'm going to pause to let that sink in.

<4-17,Leonard>-我想我听懂了  -真的吗
<4-17,Leonard>- Okay, I think I understand. - You do?

<4-19,Leonard>into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.

208
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,830
<4-20,Sheldon>这真是我听过最愚蠢的言论了
<4-20,Sheldon>That is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,380
<6-13,Sheldon>因此能享受到车险打折这件事吗
<6-13,Sheldon>and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that?

243
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,790
<6-13,Sheldon>很棒吧
<6-13,Sheldon>Hubba-hubba.

244
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,450
<6-14,Penny>-好吧  快回家  你个疯子  -对了
<6-14,Penny>- Okay, go home, crazy man. - Yeah.

245
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,220
<6-13,Sheldon>你知不知道
<6-13,Sheldon>Did you know that

246
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,080
<6-15,Sheldon>虽然莱纳德在我们国家不算高大
<6-15,Sheldon>while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country,

247
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,350
<6-15,Sheldon>但在今日的朝鲜  他绝对是标准身高
<6-15,Sheldon>in today's North Korea, he's downright average.

248
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,060
<6-15,Sheldon>正所谓乘龙佳婿啊
<6-15,Sheldon>Talk about a keeper.

249
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,420
<6-16,Penny>好吧  艾米跟你说什么了
<6-16,Penny>Okay, what did Amy tell you?

250
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,730
<6-17,Sheldon>太棒了
<6-17,Sheldon>Oh, very well.

251
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,260
<6-17,Sheldon>你再不猜出来我也编不出提示了
<6-17,Sheldon>I can't keep up this clever charade any longer.

252
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,680
<6-17,Sheldon>她告诉我
<6-17,Sheldon>She told me

253
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,030
<6-17,Sheldon>你想跟莱纳德分手
<6-17,Sheldon>that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.

254
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,220
<6-18,Penny>好吧  你听我说
<6-18,Penny>Okay, you listen to me.

255
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,720
<6-18,Penny>你想保护你朋友的做法真的很有爱
<6-18,Penny>I think it's really sweet you're trying to protect your friend,

256
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,730
<6-18,Penny>但这不关你的事  明白了吗
<6-18,Penny>but this is none of your business. Got it?

257
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,310
<6-19,Sheldon>纠正一下  这不是为了保护我的朋友
<6-19,Sheldon>Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend.

258
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,070
<6-19,Sheldon>我是喜欢内稳态
<6-19,Sheldon>I'm a big fan of homeostasis.

259
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,360
<6-19,Sheldon>你知道这是什么意思吗
<6-19,Sheldon>Do you know what that is?

260
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,950
<6-20,Penny>-当然不知道  -好吧
<6-20,Penny>- Of course not. - Yeah.

261
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,830
<6-21,Sheldon>内稳态是指一个系统
<6-21,Sheldon>Homeostasis refers to a system's ability

262
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,920
<6-21,Sheldon>调节自身内部系统的能力
<6-21,Sheldon>to regulate its internal environment

263
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,660
<6-21,Sheldon>并维持其属性在一个常规的状态下
<6-21,Sheldon>and maintain a constant condition of properties

264
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,920
<6-21,Sheldon>就好像温度或酸碱度
<6-21,Sheldon>like temperature or pH.

265
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,740
<6-22,Penny>史上最烂的床边故事
<6-22,Penny>Worst bedtime story ever.

266
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,730
<6-23,Sheldon>我想说的是
<6-23,Sheldon>My point is

267
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,520
<6-23,Sheldon>我不喜欢事物发生变化
<6-23,Sheldon>I don't like when things change.

268
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,910
<6-23,Sheldon>所以无论你心里想什么
<6-23,Sheldon>So, regardless of your feelings,

269
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,370
<6-23,Sheldon>我希望你能跟莱纳德保持现状
<6-23,Sheldon>I would like you to continue dating Leonard.

270
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,640
<6-23,Sheldon>还有
<6-23,Sheldon>And also,

271
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,280
<6-23,Sheldon>说到改变  你最近换了不同味的洗发精
<6-23,Sheldon>while we're on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo.

272
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,700
<6-23,Sheldon>我不喜欢这个新香味
<6-23,Sheldon>I'm not comfortable with the new scent.

273
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,420
<6-23,Sheldon>麻烦别瞎换  用回青苹果味的
<6-23,Sheldon>Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.

274
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,570
<6-24,Penny>好吧  宝贝  我有很多事情琢磨
<6-24,Penny>Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out,

275
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,020
<6-24,Penny>但在我想清之前  你不许告诉莱纳德一个字
<6-24,Penny>and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard.

276
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,610
<6-24,Penny>-明白了吗  -明白
<6-24,Penny>- Do you understand? - I do.

277
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,530
<6-25,Sheldon>-那洗发精的事情你明白了吗  -快滚

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,720
<6-29,Sheldon>拜托不要伤害我的朋友
<6-29,Sheldon>Please don't hurt my friend.

280
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,070
<6-30,Penny>-这是我最不想做的事情  -谢谢
<6-30,Penny>- That is the last thing I want to do. - Thank you.

281
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,140
<6-31,Sheldon>椰子味  你想什么呢
<6-31,Sheldon>Coconut? What were you thinking?

282
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,810
<6-31,Sheldon>-你又不是跳草裙舞的  -快滚回家
<6-31,Sheldon>- Are you a hula girl? - Get out!

<7-2,Penny>What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon?

285
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,990
<7-2,Penny>你知道你把我置于一个多糟糕的处境吗
<7-2,Penny>Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in?

286
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,130
<7-3,Amy>等下

288
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,050
<7-4,Sheldon>提醒你一下
<7-4,Sheldon>Yeah, just a heads-up:

289
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,080
<7-4,Sheldon>佩妮知道你泄露了关于莱纳德的事
<7-4,Sheldon>Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard.

290
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,590
<7-4,Sheldon>她气疯了

304
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,570
<8-7,Howard>其他宇航员都欺负我
<8-7,Howard>The other astronauts are being mean to me.

305
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,910
<8-8,Bernadette>不是吧  他们怎么欺负你了
<8-8,Bernadette>No, what are they doing?

306
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,980
<8-9,Howard>像那天我还在睡觉
<8-9,Howard>Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep,

307
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,590
<8-9,Howard>其中一个出去太空漫步
<8-9,Howard>one of the guys went on a space walk

308
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,470
<8-9,Howard>然后在我窗外粘了大眼橡胶外星人的面具
<8-9,Howard>and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window.

309
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,310
<8-9,Howard>我醒来后  大概尖叫了九分钟
<8-9,Howard>When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.

310
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,080
<8-10,Bernadette>可怜的华仔

313
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,160
<8-12,Bernadette>你为什么不跟他们讲道理呢
<8-12,Bernadette>Why don't you stand up to them?

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,400
<8-13,Howard>我该说什么呢
<8-13,Howard>What am I supposed to say?

315
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,040
<8-13,Howard>不知道
<8-13,Howard>I don't know.

316
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,800
<8-14,Bernadette>就说  "欺负人不好
<8-14,Bernadette>Say, "Being mean is lame.

317
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,260
<8-14,Bernadette>对人友善才酷"
<8-14,Bernadette>What's cool is being nice."

<8-17,Howard>My mom already tried that.

323
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,140
<8-17,Howard>完全是火上浇油
<8-17,Howard>It only made things worse.

<9-12,Sheldon>Maybe you'd like to go with them to meet girls.

340
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,560
<9-13,Leonard>我怎么会有兴趣  我有佩妮

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,550
<9-14,Sheldon>暂时有而已
<9-14,Sheldon>Yeah, for now.

342
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,120
<9-14,Sheldon>那女人可不是省油的灯  莱纳德
<9-14,Sheldon>But that woman has a death wish, Leonard.

343
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,360
<9-14,Sheldon>她跟陌生人讲话  她会逗陌生的狗
<9-14,Sheldon>She talks to strangers; she pets unfamiliar dogs;

344
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,740
<9-14,Sheldon>而且闯进她的卧室
<9-14,Sheldon>and it is ridiculously easy

345
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,750
<9-14,Sheldon>实在是莫名其妙的容易
<9-14,Sheldon>to break into her apartment.

346
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,030
<9-14,Sheldon>如果我是你
<9-14,Sheldon>If I were you,

347
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,280
<9-14,Sheldon>我会准备个后备
<9-14,Sheldon>I'd get a back-up.

348
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,810
<9-15,Leonard>你不能用随便碰到的人取代
<9-15,Leonard>You can't just replace someone you care about

349
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,730
<9-15,Leonard>你喜欢的人
<9-15,Leonard>with some other random person.

350

<9-16,Stuart>拜托别破坏我的美梦
<9-16,Stuart>No, please don't ruin this for me.

351
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,170
<9-17,Sheldon>你还记得启用爱德华·诺顿
<9-17,Sheldon>Do you remember how upset I was

352
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,150
<9-17,Sheldon>出演绿巨人的时候我有多愤怒吗
<9-17,Sheldon>when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?

353
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,630
<9-18,Leonard>记得  你嘟哝了一个星期说
<9-18,Leonard>Yes, you walked around for a week saying,

354
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,290
<9-18,Leonard>"谢尔顿对选角不满意"[绿巨人语气]
<9-18,Leonard>"Sheldon unhappy with casting choice."

355
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,960
<9-19,Sheldon>但马克·鲁法罗出演《复仇者联盟》里的
<9-19,Sheldon>But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers,

356
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,650
<9-19,Sheldon>绿巨人时效果却更好
<9-19,Sheldon>and he was even better.

357
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,640
<9-20,Leonard>你想说什么
<9-20,Leonard>What's your point?

358
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,170
<9-21,Sheldon>就当我是浪漫主义者吧
<9-21,Sheldon>Call me a romantic.

359
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,000
<9-21,Sheldon>我觉得

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,170
<10-5,Leonard>我就带他去吃冰淇淋
<10-5,Leonard>I'd take him for ice cream.

369
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,340
<10-5,Leonard>他咬了  我就省了一顿冰激凌
<10-5,Leonard>I didn't have to take him for ice cream.
