1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,320
<1-1,Raj>我对僵尸有一点困惑
<1-1,Raj>Here's what I wonder about zombies.

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,940
<1-1,Raj>要是他们找不到人肉吃会怎么样
<1-1,Raj>What happens if they can't get any human flesh to eat?

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,570
<1-1,Raj>他们不可能饿死  他们本来就是死人嘛
<1-1,Raj>They can't starve to death-- they're already dead.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,610
<1-2,Howard>你听听我的  我昨晚花了一个小时在想
<1-2,Howard>You take this one. I spent an hour last night on

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,060
<1-2,Howard>"既然吸血鬼在镜子里
<1-2,Howard>"How do vampires shave

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,350
<1-2,Howard>都看不见自己  他们是怎么给自己剃胡子的"
<1-2,Howard>when they can't see themselves in the mirror"?

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,440
<1-3,Sheldon>衣冠楚楚的吸血鬼两两搭伴
<1-3,Sheldon>Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,680
<1-3,Sheldon>互相刮胡子  解释完毕
<1-3,Sheldon>and shave each other-- case closed.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,140
<1-4,Raj>好吧  那  僵尸呢
<1-4,Raj>Yeah, okay, so, zombies.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,220
<1-5,Leonard>我觉得这取决于僵尸的种类  拉杰
<1-5,Leonard>I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,340
<1-5,Leonard>我们现在说的是快僵尸还是慢僵尸
<1-5,Leonard>Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies?

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,400
<1-5,Leonard>在《28天》里面  如果那些僵尸不吃东西
<1-5,Leonard>Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn't eat,

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,470
<1-5,Leonard>-他们就会饿死  -你说的是
<1-5,Leonard>- they starved.  - You're thinking

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,680
<1-6,Howard>《惊变28天》
<1-6,Howard>of 28 Days Later.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,000
<1-6,Howard>《28天》里面桑德拉·布洛克去戒酒
<1-6,Howard>28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,560
<1-6,Howard>结果让观众升华到濒死状态
<1-6,Howard>and puts the audience into an undead state.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,460
<1-7,Raj>喂  不许你说桑德拉·布洛克坏话
<1-7,Raj>Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock!

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,590
<1-7,Raj>你以为这样显得很有内涵
<1-7,Raj>You think it makes you look cultured,

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,350
<1-7,Raj>但你表现出来的只是刻薄而已
<1-7,Raj>but you just come off as bitter.

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,180
<1-8,Leonard>12点方向  希伯特博士
<1-8,Leonard>Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o'clock.

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,280
<1-9,Howard>为啥大学校长
<1-9,Howard>Why's the president of the university

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,490
<1-9,Howard>要来食堂里视察呢
<1-9,Howard>slumming in the cafeteria?

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,190
<1-10,Sheldon>也许他在模仿莎翁笔下的亨利五世
<1-10,Sheldon>Perhaps he's emulating Shakespeare's Henry V,

24
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,360
<1-10,Sheldon>微服私访  想知道在民间
<1-10,Sheldon>who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them,

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,480
<1-10,Sheldon>他的臣民们是如何看待自己的
<1-10,Sheldon>to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects.

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,570
<1-10,Sheldon>当然  如果他看过我发给他的1300封
<1-10,Sheldon>Of course, if he'd have read any of the 1,300 e-mails

27
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,580
<1-10,Sheldon>关于学校管理的邮件中的任何一封
<1-10,Sheldon>I've sent him on the subject of his administration,

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,440
<1-10,Sheldon>他就不必这么费劲了
<1-10,Sheldon>he could have saved himself the trouble.

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,420
<1-11,Raj>也可能是因为他听说今天周二有炸薯棒
<1-11,Raj>Or maybe he heard it's Tator Tot Tuesday.

30
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,680
<1-11,Raj>反正我是因为这个才来的
<1-11,Raj>That's why I'm here.

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,090
<1-12,Dr. Seibert>嗨  我最器重的天才们
<1-12,Dr. Seibert>Hey, there's my favorite geniuses!

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,860
<1-12,Dr. Seibert>今天过得怎么样啊
<1-12,Dr. Seibert>How are we doing today?

33
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,520
<1-13,Sheldon>这取决于  你打算
<1-13,Sheldon>That depends-- how much longer

34
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,580
<1-13,Sheldon>在我的肩膀上抚摸多久
<1-13,Sheldon>do you plan on fondling my shoulder?

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,970
<1-14,Seibert>抱歉  库珀博士  我忘了你有爱抚恐惧症
<1-14,Seibert>Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.

36
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,870
<1-15,Sheldon>我不是怕人抚摸  我是怕细菌
<1-15,Sheldon>It's not a touch phobia, it's a germ phobia.

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,060
<1-15,Sheldon>要是你愿意戴一双乳胶手套
<1-15,Sheldon>If you'd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,810
<1-15,Sheldon>给我查疝气都没问题
<1-15,Sheldon>I'll let you check me for a hernia.

39
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,180
<1-16,Seibert>好吧
<1-16,Seibert>Yeah.

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,850
<1-16,Seibert>听好了各位
<1-16,Seibert>So, listen, fellas,

41
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,840
<1-16,Seibert>本周六晚上谁想去参加一个小宴会呢
<1-16,Seibert>who's up for a little party this Saturday night?

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,040
<1-16,Seibert>美酒  佳肴  没准儿还会有几位甜妞
<1-16,Seibert>Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.

43
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,040
<1-17,Raj>听起来很赞啊  我去
<1-17,Raj>Sounds great! I'm in!

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,290
<1-18,Howard>慢着
<1-18,Howard>Hold on.

45
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,520
<1-19,Sheldon>就因为一位怪蜀黍给你们糖吃
<1-19,Sheldon>Just because the nice man is offering you candy,

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,190
<1-19,Sheldon>并不意味着你就应该跳进人贩子的破车里
<1-19,Sheldon>doesn't mean you should jump into his windowless van.

47
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,800
<1-19,Sheldon>究竟是什么场合啊
<1-19,Sheldon>What's the occasion?

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,900
<1-20,Seibert>就是本校的几位赞助者
<1-20,Seibert>Just a little fund-raiser for the university.

49
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,810
<1-21,Sheldon>啊哈  沾满泪痕的气垫还在车后面呢
<1-21,Sheldon>Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.

50
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,430
<1-22,Seibert>你不情愿我很理解  库珀博士
<1-22,Seibert>I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper,

51
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,310
<1-22,Seibert>我深表同情  但残酷的事实摆在面前
<1-22,Seibert>and I sympathize, but the hard facts are,

52
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,460
<1-22,Seibert>有时候我们不得不为了募集研究资金
<1-22,Seibert>occasionally, we have to shake a few hands

53
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,720
<1-22,Seibert>而跟某些人溜须拍马
<1-22,Seibert>and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,590
<1-23,Sheldon>我不管  这太下作了
<1-23,Sheldon>I don't care; it's demeaning.

55
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,970
<1-23,Sheldon>我不愿想像只德州博览会的冠军猪一样
<1-23,Sheldon>And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off

56
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,420
<1-23,Sheldon>被人领着到处表演
<1-23,Sheldon>like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair.

57
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,660
<1-23,Sheldon>顺便提一下  这种博览会肯定不是你想穿着
<1-23,Sheldon>Which, by the way, is something you don't want to attend

58
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,040
<1-23,Sheldon>别有星际迷航徽章的衣服参加的
<1-23,Sheldon>wearing a Star Trek ensign's uniform.

59
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,470
<1-23,Sheldon>好吧
<1-23,Sheldon>All right,

60
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,900
<1-24,Seibert>那我换个说法
<1-24,Seibert>let me put it this way.

61
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,070
<1-24,Seibert>你们都得给我穿好正装参加这个宴会
<1-24,Seibert>You're gonna put on a suit, you're gonna come to this party,

62
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,420
<1-24,Seibert>你们要向一群老人解释
<1-24,Seibert>and you're gonna explain your research

63
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,740
<1-24,Seibert>你们所做的研究
<1-24,Seibert>to a bunch of old people,

64
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,570
<1-24,Seibert>否则  我对天发誓  我会用热勺子烫瞎你的眼睛
<1-24,Seibert>or I swear to God, I'll blind you with a hot spoon,

65
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,200
<1-24,Seibert>就像《贫民窟的百万富翁》里的那个小男孩一样
<1-24,Seibert>like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,340
<1-25,Raj>你肯定不想那样的
<1-25,Raj>Oh, you don't want that.

67
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,020
<1-26,Seibert>那就周六晚上咯
<1-26,Seibert>So, Saturday night!

68
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,480
<1-26,Seibert>包你开心
<1-26,Seibert>It's gonna be off the hook.

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,630
<1-28,Seibert>速度拿开
<1-28,Seibert>Get over it.

70
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,240
<1-29,Raj>哦天啊
<1-29,Raj>Oh, boy!

71
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,200
<1-29,Raj>又是炸薯棒又是宴会邀请
<1-29,Raj>Tator tots and a party invitation?

72
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,870
<1-29,Raj>今天是个好日子啊
<1-29,Raj>What a great day!

73
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,500
<1-29,Raj>生活大爆炸
<1-29,Raj>第四季第十五集

74
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,830
<2-1,Penny>好了
<2-1,Penny>There you go.

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,130
<2-2,Leonard>你确定这样就行了
<2-2,Leonard>Are you sure this is right?

76
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,990
<2-3,Penny>嗯  把这一段塞到裤子里  就没事了
<2-3,Penny>Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants; you'll be fine.

77
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,200
<2-4,Howard>一起去给拍那些有钱人的马屁吧
<2-4,Howard>Okay, let's go smooch some rich, wrinkled tochis.

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,850
<2-5,Penny>霍华德  我真不敢相信伯纳黛特居然让你
<2-5,Penny>Oh, Howard, I can't believe Bernadette let you go

79
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,310
<2-5,Penny>穿着女式衬领去参加这么正式的宴会
<2-5,Penny>to a fancy party wearing a dickey.

80
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,400
<2-6,Howard>不好意思  我的衣服不是我女朋友挑的
<2-6,Howard>Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn't pick out my clothes.

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
<2-6,Howard>是我妈挑的
<2-6,Howard>My mother does.

82
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,990
<2-7,Leonard>我们该出发了
<2-7,Leonard>Oh. We should get going.

83
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,950
<2-8,Howard>那谢尔顿呢
<2-8,Howard>What about Sheldon?

84
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,130
<2-9,Sheldon>谢尔顿不去
<2-9,Sheldon>Sheldon is not going.

85
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,480
<2-10,Leonard>真的假的  那我们怎么跟希伯特交待
<2-10,Leonard>Really? What do we tell Siebert?

86
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,690
<2-11,Sheldon>告诉他库珀博士觉得他宝贵时间最有价值的用途
<2-11,Sheldon>Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time

87
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,920
<2-11,Sheldon>就是运用他那举世罕见的天赋
<2-11,Sheldon>is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties

88
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,580
<2-11,Sheldon>来揭开自然的面纱  目睹上帝的真面
<2-11,Sheldon>to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.

89
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,570
<2-12,Penny>谢尔顿  现在是周六晚上  你要去洗衣服了
<2-12,Penny>Sheldon, it's Saturday night, you'll be doing laundry.

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,070
<2-13,Sheldon>别跟他说这个  说揭开面纱啥的
<2-13,Sheldon>Don't tell him that, tell him the mask thing.

91
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,450
<3-1,Howard>喂  把领带塞回裤子里
<3-1,Howard>Hey, put your tie back in your pants.

92
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,150
<3-3,Raj>这地儿不错啊
<3-3,Raj>Nice place.

93
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,980
<3-3,Raj>让我想起了我爸妈在新德里的房子
<3-3,Raj>Reminds me of my parents' house back in New Delhi.

94
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,020
<3-5,Raj>-别逗了  -真的  我家很有钱的
<3-5,Raj>- You're kidding.  - No. We are very wealthy.

95
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,720
<3-5,Raj>但跟这里唯一的区别就是  我们的仆人更多
<3-5,Raj>But the only difference is, we have more servants.

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,430
<3-6,Leonard>-比这儿还多啊  -多得没地儿使唤
<3-6,Leonard>- More than this?  - More than we can use.

97
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,690
<3-7,Raj>你看吧  在印度  我们都不会犯
<3-7,Raj>You see, in India, we don't make the mistake

98
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,060
<3-7,Raj>让人们有梦想这种错误
<3-7,Raj>of letting our poor people have dreams.

99
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,230
<3-8,Seibert>我的牛人小队来了
<3-8,Seibert>Ah. There's my band of brainiacs.

100
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,950
<3-8,Seibert>库珀博士在哪儿呢
<3-8,Seibert>Where's Dr. Cooper?

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,730
<3-9,Leonard>他正在揭开自然的面纱  目睹上帝的真面
<3-9,Leonard>He's tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.

102
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,010
<3-10,Seibert>校领导认定他有颗美丽心灵
<3-10,Seibert>The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind.

103
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,210
<3-10,Seibert>我认为他就是浮云
<3-10,Seibert>I think he's just bananas.

104
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,250
<3-10,Seibert>来吧  我来介绍你们认识一位
<3-10,Seibert>Come on, let me introduce you

105
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,790
<3-10,Seibert>咱们学校的主要捐款人
<3-10,Seibert>to one of the university's leading donors.

106
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,770
<3-11,Raj>我觉得咱们被他们所谓的美女误导了
<3-11,Raj>I think we were misled about the cute girls.

107
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,070
<3-12,Seibert>莱森女士  这是我们学校
<3-12,Seibert>Mrs. Latham, I'd like you to meet three

108
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,030
<3-12,Seibert>三位了不起的青年学者
<3-12,Seibert>of our outstanding young researchers.

109
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,820
<3-12,Seibert>这位是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
<3-12,Seibert>This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

110
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,130
<3-12,Seibert>拉杰·库萨帕里博士和霍华德·沃罗威茨
<3-12,Seibert>Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.

111
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,480
<3-13,Mrs Latham>沃罗威茨你怎么了
<3-13,Mrs Latham>Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz,

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,450
<3-13,Mrs Latham>坚持不下去读博么
<3-13,Mrs Latham>couldn't stick with it long enough to get your PhD?

113
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,620
<3-14,Howard>我是工程师
<3-14,Howard>I'm an engineer.

114
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,810
<3-14,Howard>工程师通常不需要博士学位
<3-14,Howard>Most engineers don't bother with a PhD.

115
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,880
<3-14,Howard>不过你没准想知道
<3-14,Howard>But you may be interested to know

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,470
<3-14,Howard>我给NASA设计过零重力废物排放系统的
<3-14,Howard>I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.

117
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,990
<3-15,Mrs Latham>懂了  你就是太空水管工
<3-15,Mrs Latham>Got it-- you're a space plumber.

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
<3-16,Howard>我去吧台喝两杯
<3-16,Howard>I'm gonna go hit the bar.

119
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,920
<3-17,Mrs Latham>介绍这两位吧
<3-17,Mrs Latham>Tell me about these two.

120
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,860
<3-18,Raj>先介绍他
<3-18,Raj>Do him first.

121
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,260
<3-19,Seibert>霍夫斯塔德博士今天晚上会做个我们实验物理项目的演讲
<3-19,Seibert>Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight.

122
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,860
<3-19,Seibert>我想你会对他迷人的工作感兴趣的
<3-19,Seibert>I think you'll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.

123
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,250
<3-20,Mrs Latham>行吧
<3-20,Mrs Latham>Right.

124
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,810
<3-20,Mrs Latham>迷我一下
<3-20,Mrs Latham>Fascinate me.

125
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,230
<3-22,Mrs Latham>他们快要尿裤子的样子很可爱吧
<3-22,Mrs Latham>They're cute when they're about to wet themselves, aren't they?

126
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,160
<3-22,Mrs Latham>这么说吧
<3-22,Mrs Latham>I'll make it easy for you.

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,800
<3-22,Mrs Latham>每天早上你到实验室的第一件事
<3-22,Mrs Latham>When you arrive at the lab in the morning,

128
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,020
<3-22,Mrs Latham>你会最先打开什么机器
<3-22,Mrs Latham>what sort of machine do you turn on?

129
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,650
<3-23,Leonard>咖啡机
<3-23,Leonard>Coffee maker?

130
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,490
<3-24,Mrs Latham>行吧 库那什么博士  到你了
<3-24,Mrs Latham>All right, Dr. Kooth-- uh, whatever it is-- you're up.

131
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,530
<3-25,Raj>我叫库萨帕里
<3-25,Raj>It's Koothrappali.

132
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,570
<3-25,Raj>我得去嘘嘘了
<3-25,Raj>I have to tinkle.

133
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,860
<4-1,Sheldon>于是  我没有屈服于权贵
<4-1,Sheldon>And so, instead of bowing to pressure,

134
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,580
<4-1,Sheldon>去参加那个毫无意义的社交晚会
<4-1,Sheldon>and going to that pointless soiree,

135
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,890
<4-1,Sheldon>而是待在家里  把衣服都洗了
<4-1,Sheldon>I stayed right here and did a load of whites.

136
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,040
<4-2,Amy (on webcam)>通常我会赞许你那反社会的大男子气概
<4-2,Amy (on webcam)>Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude

137
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
<4-2,Amy (on webcam)>不听你们领导的
<4-2,Amy (on webcam)>toward "The Man,"

138
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,770
<4-2,Amy (on webcam)>但这回  我觉得你犯了个愚蠢的错误
<4-2,Amy (on webcam)>but, in this case, I think you've made a foolish mistake.

139
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,360
<4-3,Sheldon>不可能
<4-3,Sheldon>Unlikely.

140
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,890
<4-3,Sheldon>但请你说完
<4-3,Sheldon>But make your case.

141
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,160
<4-3,Sheldon>请记住  您那批评的语气
<4-3,Sheldon>Keeping in mind that your critical attitude

142
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,260
<4-3,Sheldon>正毁坏咱们周六夜晚的美好时光
<4-3,Sheldon>is ruining our Saturday night together,

143
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,910
<4-3,Sheldon>我都没有把你窗口最小化
<4-3,Sheldon>and I'm not above minimizing your window.

144
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,880
<4-4,Amy>谢尔顿  不管你喜不喜欢
<4-4,Amy>Sheldon, like it or not,

145
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,850
<4-4,Amy>在你能把你的智慧
<4-4,Amy>until you manage to upload your intelligence

146
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,720
<4-4,Amy>上载到一颗自给自足  装备着高速互联网
<4-4,Amy>into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite,

147
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,060
<4-4,Amy>和隐形设备的轨道卫星上之前
<4-4,Amy>equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device,

148
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,180
<4-4,Amy>你还是需要依靠其他人类同胞的
<4-4,Amy>you will be dependent on other members of the human race.

149
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,820
<4-5,Sheldon>够了  我要把你最小化了
<4-5,Sheldon>That's it. Prepare to be minimized.

150
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,210
<4-6,Amy>我还没说完
<4-6,Amy>I'm not finished.

151
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,570
<4-6,Amy>谢尔顿  所有科学家都要去募集资金
<4-6,Amy>All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon.

152
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,350
<4-6,Amy>你觉得我的实验室靠的是什么资金
<4-6,Amy>How do you think I paid for my lab?

153
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,250
<4-6,Amy>我去了沙特阿拉伯  遇到个王子
<4-6,Amy>I went to Saudi Arabia and met with a prince

154
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,520
<4-7,Sheldon>他正好对神经生物学感兴趣
<4-7,Sheldon>who had an interest in neurobiology.

155
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,270
<4-7,Sheldon>你的实验室靠中东业余爱好者资助的么
<4-7,Sheldon>Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?

156
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,760
<4-8,Amy>更准确地说  法伊萨是我未婚夫
<4-8,Amy>Technically, Faisal is my fianc?

157
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,870
<4-8,Amy>但我现在有最高端的双光子显微镜
<4-8,Amy>But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope

158
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,520
<4-8,Amy>冬天去利雅得(阿拉伯半岛中部的城市)还有个住所
<4-8,Amy>and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.

159
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,710
<4-9,Sheldon>终于明白你Facebook上面那些诡异的骆驼比赛的照片
<4-9,Sheldon>Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos

160
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,720
<4-9,Sheldon>是哪里来的了
<4-9,Sheldon>on your Facebook page.

161
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,720
<4-10,Amy>你这么想
<4-10,Amy>And consider this:

162
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,170
<4-10,Amy>如果物理学院没有你出面
<4-10,Amy>without you to make the case for the physics department,

163
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,160
<4-10,Amy>募捐的重任就落到莱纳德和拉杰那种人头上了
<4-10,Amy>the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.

164
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,220
<4-11,Sheldon>你唬我么
<4-11,Sheldon>Are you trying to scare me?

165
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,920
<4-11,Sheldon>你成功了
<4-11,Sheldon>'Cause you're succeeding.

166
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,270
<4-12,Amy>等着更恐怖的吧
<4-12,Amy>Well, then prepare to be terrified.

167
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,870
<4-12,Amy>如果你的朋友们没有足够说服力的话
<4-12,Amy>If your friends are unconvincing,

168
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,590
<4-12,Amy>今年的捐款可能就被
<4-12,Amy>this year's donations might go to,

169
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,360
<4-12,Amy>地质学院卷走了
<4-12,Amy>say, the geology department.

170
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,180
<4-13,Sheldon>不要吧  那些烂泥研究员
<4-13,Sheldon>Oh, dear, not the dirt people!

171
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,890
<4-14,Amy>或者更糟糕

176
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,990
<4-17,Sheldon>噢  人文啊
<4-17,Sheldon>Oh, the humanities!

177
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
<5-1,Leonard>往好处想  我觉得希伯特校长再也不会
<5-1,Leonard>On the bright side, I don't think President Siebert

<5-1,Leonard>让我们参加任何募捐活动了
<5-1,Leonard>will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.

<5-2,Howard>受戒仪式都没这么痛苦
<5-2,Howard>It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah.

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,210
<5-2,Howard>那些老家伙也就捏捏你的小脸蛋
<5-2,Howard>The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek

<5-3,Raj>看这的虾有多大
<5-3,Raj>Look at the size of these shrimp!

184
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,340
<5-3,Raj>到多大就可以叫做龙虾了
<5-3,Raj>At what point do we start calling them lobsters?

185
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,800
<5-4,Leonard>承认吧  我们搞砸了
<5-4,Leonard>Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.

186
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,450
<5-5,Mrs Latham>没那么糟糕啦
<5-5,Mrs Latham>Oh, you didn't do that badly.

189
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,270
<5-7,Mrs Latham>亲爱的我不关心
<5-7,Mrs Latham>I no longer care, dear.

190
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,810
<5-7,Mrs Latham>别着急
<5-7,Mrs Latham>But don't worry,

191
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,240
<5-7,Mrs Latham>今天晚上见到你们很高兴
<5-7,Mrs Latham>I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.

192
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,140
<5-8,Leonard>别开玩笑了  哪里值得高兴了
<5-8,Leonard>You're kidding. That was good for you?

193
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,510
<5-8,Leonard>我出了一身汗了
<5-8,Leonard>'Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.

194

<5-9,Mrs Latham>最好不过了
<5-9,Mrs Latham>Excellent! There's nothing I like better

195
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,040
<5-9,Mrs Latham>我最喜欢调戏聪明人了

196
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,590
<5-10,Leonard>啥
<5-10,Leonard>Why?

<6-23,Leonard>到底谁才是疯子
<6-23,Leonard>Who's crazy now?

229
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,390
<6-20,Mrs Latham>你好  莱森太太
<6-20,Mrs Latham>Hello, Mrs. Latham.

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,700
<6-6,Leonard>她想跟我共进晚餐  谈谈我的研究
<6-6,Leonard>She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.

236
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,770
<6-3,Sheldon>就你那点研究还用得着整个晚餐的时间来讨论吗
<6-3,Sheldon>An entire dinner to talk about your research?

237
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,790
<6-3,Sheldon>你们去哪吃  免下车的魔术盒快餐[美国快餐店]吗
<6-3,Sheldon>Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?

238
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,600
<6-4,Leonard>不管去哪都好
<6-4,Leonard>Well, wherever we're going,

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,190
<6-5,Sheldon>-我明白了  -明白什么了
<6-5,Sheldon>- I see what's happening.  - What?

242
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,130
<6-7,Sheldon>我的境界吓到她了
<6-7,Sheldon>My stature intimidates her,

243
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,100
<6-7,Sheldon>所以她就利用你来接近我
<6-7,Sheldon>so she's using you to get to me.

244
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,600
<6-7,Sheldon>狡猾的老师太
<6-7,Sheldon>Crafty old gal.

245
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,720
<6-8,Leonard>不好意思  但你并不是这间公寓里唯一
<6-8,Leonard>Excuse me, but you are not the only

246
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,990
<6-8,Leonard>一名出色的科学家
<6-8,Leonard>distinguished scientist in this apartment.

247
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,820
<6-8,Leonard>我在同行评审刊物里发表过论文
<6-8,Leonard>I've been published in peer-reviewed journals,

248
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,580
<6-8,Leonard>我在实验粒子物理学方面获得过
<6-8,Leonard>I received a Dissertation of the Year award

249
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,950
<6-8,Leonard>年度专题论文奖
<6-8,Leonard>for experimental particle physics.

250
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,940
<6-9,Sheldon>不  不可能
<6-9,Sheldon>No, that can't be it.

251
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,640
<6-9,Sheldon>还有你似乎忘了
<6-9,Sheldon>And since you seem

252
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,810
<6-9,Sheldon>咱俩住在一起
<6-9,Sheldon>to have forgotten, the reason we live together

253
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,480
<6-9,Sheldon>是因为咱俩是死党
<6-9,Sheldon>is we're best friends.

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,580
<6-9,Sheldon>我会挺你的  杰克
<6-9,Sheldon>And I got your back, Jack.

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
<6-11,Leonard>-晚餐棒极了  -很高兴你喜欢
<6-11,Leonard>- That was a great meal.  - I'm glad you enjoyed it.

256
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,070
<6-13,Leonard>我唯一一次吃得这么好  就是我妈来看我
<6-13,Leonard>The only time I eat this well is when my mom's in town

257
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,040
<6-13,Leonard>-然后带我出去吃饭那次  -是吗
<6-13,Leonard>- and she takes me out to dinner.  - Is that so?

258
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,080
<6-15,Leonard>你跟她有点像
<6-15,Leonard>You kind of remind me of her.

259
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,130
<6-15,Leonard>她也喜欢把人弄得不自在
<6-15,Leonard>She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.

260
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,530
<6-16,Mrs Latham>你让我想起我在大学时期的男朋友
<6-16,Mrs Latham>Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.

261
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,370
<6-17,Leonard>-不会吧  -很可爱的男孩
<6-17,Leonard>- No kidding.  - Sweet boy.

262
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,850
<6-18,Mrs Latham>非常聪明
<6-18,Mrs Latham>Very smart.

263
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,020
<6-18,Mrs Latham>要是他有钱就好了
<6-18,Mrs Latham>If only he'd had money.

264
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,920
<6-19,Leonard>说到钱
<6-19,Leonard>So, hey, speaking of money,

265
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,340
<6-19,Leonard>你想不想帮物理系添置一个
<6-19,Leonard>how are you feeling about helping the physics department

266
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,680
<6-19,Leonard>低温离心泵和一个分子筛
<6-19,Leonard>get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?

267
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,170
<6-20,Mrs Latham>我只能说  你很有说服力
<6-20,Mrs Latham>Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.

268
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,550
<6-21,Leonard>-太好了  太好了  -而我真的
<6-21,Leonard>- Oh, good, good.  - And I'm seriously

269
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,790
<6-22,Mrs Latham>在考虑要进一步发展
<6-22,Mrs Latham>considering taking it to the next level.

270
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,100
<6-23,Leonard>太棒了  这太好了
<6-23,Leonard>Terrific. Great.

271
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,200
<6-23,Leonard>怎么个进一步发展法
<6-23,Leonard>What level is that?

272
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,380
<6-23,Leonard>现在你不像我妈了
<6-23,Leonard>Okay, now you don't remind me of my mom.

273
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,240
<7-1,Sheldon>对不起  也就是说  最终僵尸会
<7-1,Sheldon>I'm sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack

274
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,280
<7-1,Sheldon>袭击桑德拉·布洛克[美国女演员]所在的戒酒中心吗
<7-1,Sheldon>the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?

275
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,940
<7-2,Penny>没错  谢尔顿  继续看吧
<7-2,Penny>Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.

276
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,570
<7-3,Sheldon>这太可惜了
<7-3,Sheldon>You know, it's a shame,

277
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,460
<7-3,Sheldon>她那么费劲地要戒酒
<7-3,Sheldon>all that work she's doing to get sober,

278
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,890
<7-3,Sheldon>结果就为了被生吞活剥
<7-3,Sheldon>only to be torn apart and eaten alive.

279
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,810
<7-4,Howard>晚餐怎么样
<7-4,Howard>Hey. How was dinner?

280
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,540
<7-5,Leonard>一级棒  我得喝上一杯
<7-5,Leonard>Swell. I need a drink.

281
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,370
<7-5,Leonard>我们还有酒吗
<7-5,Leonard>Do we have any alcohol?

282
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,750
<7-6,Sheldon>没有  但是我们有土豆  我可以给你做伏特加
<7-6,Sheldon>No. But we have potatoes -- I could make you vodka.

283
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,220
<7-6,Sheldon>不过要两周才能做好
<7-6,Sheldon>It'll take two weeks.

284
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,440
<7-7,Penny>莱纳德  你没事吧
<7-7,Penny>Leonard, are you okay?

285
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,000
<7-8,Leonard>我不确定
<7-8,Leonard>Um, I'm not sure.

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
<7-9,Howard>怎么了
<7-9,Howard>What's going on?

287
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,320
<7-10,Leonard>莱森说她在考虑要给我们捐钱
<7-10,Leonard>Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering

288
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
<7-10,Leonard>好让我们买一个
<7-10,Leonard>donating money so we could get

289
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,650
<7-11,Sheldon>低温离心泵
<7-11,Sheldon>a cryogenic centrifugal pump...

290
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,640
<7-12,Howard>太棒了
<7-12,Howard>Yes!

291
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,170
<7-13,Leonard>然后她就把舌头伸进我嘴里了
<7-13,Leonard>...then she stuck her tongue down my throat.

292
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,490
<7-14,Sheldon>为什么
<7-14,Sheldon>Why?

293
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,600
<7-15,Penny>我们不能总是每件事都解释给你听
<7-15,Penny>Okay, we can't keep explaining everything.

294
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,550
<7-15,Penny>自己去看看我们买给你的那本书
<7-15,Penny>Read that book we got you.

295
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,490
<7-16,Leonard>她喜欢我
<7-16,Leonard>She hit on me.

296
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,780
<7-17,Howard>等一下  等一下  等一下  你是说
<7-17,Howard>Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us

297
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,300
<7-17,Howard>那个老师太想要跟你上床
<7-17,Howard>that old lady wanted to have sex with you

298
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,930
<7-17,Howard>作为给你的院系捐赠上百万美金的条件吗
<7-17,Howard>in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?

299
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,010
<7-18,Leonard>好像是
<7-18,Leonard>I think so.

300
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,900
<7-19,Howard>你个幸运的小鸭子
<7-19,Howard>You lucky duck.

301
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,190
<7-20,Penny>你还真是够扭曲的啊
<7-20,Penny>You're really a broken toy, aren't you?

302
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,870
<7-21,Leonard>我赶在她有下一步行动之前
<7-21,Leonard>I was able to get out of there

303
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,150
<7-21,Leonard>就逃回来了
<7-21,Leonard>before anything else happened,

304
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,300
<7-21,Leonard>可她明晚还想见我
<7-21,Leonard>but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.

305
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,870
<7-22,Sheldon>太棒了  你准备穿什么
<7-22,Sheldon>Excellent! What are you planning to wear?

306
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,510
<7-23,Leonard>什么
<7-23,Leonard>What?

307
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,580
<7-24,Sheldon>佩妮  你在用肉体
<7-24,Sheldon>Penny, you're an expert

308
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,910
<7-24,Sheldon>来交换物质这反面是专家
<7-24,Sheldon>on trading sexual favors for material gain --

309
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,620
<7-24,Sheldon>教教他
<7-24,Sheldon>walk him through this.

310
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,430
<7-25,Leonard>不不  等一下
<7-25,Leonard>Well, n-no, hold on a second,

311
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,940
<7-25,Leonard>我才不要跟她上床呢
<7-25,Leonard>I'm not going to sleep with her.

312
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,050
<7-26,Sheldon>但是我们需要低温离心泵
<7-26,Sheldon>But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.

313
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,580
<7-27,Leonard>想也别想  我才不会这么做呢
<7-27,Leonard>Well, forget it! It's not gonna happen.

314
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,600
<7-28,Sheldon>拜托  莱纳德  这可能是你
<7-28,Sheldon>Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance

315
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,470
<7-28,Sheldon>为科学做贡献的唯一机会了
<7-28,Sheldon>to make a real contribution to science!

316
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,910
<7-29,Leonard>我重申一遍  不可能
<7-29,Leonard>I repeat, not gonna happen.

317
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,440
<7-30,Penny>你刚才说我出卖肉体来交换物质
<7-30,Penny>What was all that about me trading sexual favors

318
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,160
<7-30,Penny>是什么意思
<7-30,Penny>for material gain?

319
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,880
<7-31,Sheldon>这是赞美
<7-31,Sheldon>It was a compliment.

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,720
<7-31,Sheldon>我觉得值得赞美的时候就该赞美
<7-31,Sheldon>I believe in giving credit where credit is due.

321
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,220
<8-1,Sheldon (on phone)>好的  我会转告他
<8-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Okay, fine. I'll tell him.

322
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,590
<8-1,Sheldon (on phone)>莱纳德  莱森太太的车在楼下等你
<8-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Leonard, Mrs. Latham's car is here for you.

323
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,780
<8-2,Leonard>我一会儿就回来  我就下去为经费
<8-2,Leonard>I won't be too late; I'm just gonna make

324
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,020
<8-2,Leonard>做最后一次努力  再跟她道声晚安
<8-2,Leonard>a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.

325
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,920
<8-3,Sheldon>等等  我有东西要给你
<8-3,Sheldon>Hold on, I have something for you.

326
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,870
<8-4,Leonard>这是什么
<8-4,Leonard>What's this?

327
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,450
<8-5,Sheldon>你今晚可能会用到的东西
<8-5,Sheldon>Just a few things you may need tonight.

328
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,670
<8-5,Sheldon>BB油  保险套  还有
<8-5,Sheldon>Baby oil, condoms and, uh...

329
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,520
<8-5,Sheldon>我在医药学院搞来的小药丸
<8-5,Sheldon>a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology.

330
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,560
<8-5,Sheldon>他们说这是伟哥中的战斗哥
<8-5,Sheldon>They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.

331
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,980
<8-6,Leonard>我不会跟她上床的
<8-6,Leonard>I am not going to have sex with her.

332
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,080
<8-7,Sheldon>或许这个能帮助你克服你的不情愿
<8-7,Sheldon>Maybe this will overcome your reluctance.

333
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,700
<8-7,Sheldon>为了激发你的性欲  我上网找了
<8-7,Sheldon>I went on the Internet and found a photograph

334
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,990
<8-7,Sheldon>一张莱森太太25岁时的照片
<8-7,Sheldon>of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming.

335
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,530
<8-7,Sheldon>看她穿着马鞍鞋呢  嗷~
<8-7,Sheldon>Check out those saddle shoes.

336
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,160
<8-8,Leonard>你脑子进水啦
<8-8,Leonard>Are you insane?

337
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,880
<8-8,Leonard>我才不会为了几台新设备
<8-8,Leonard>I'm not going to prostitute myself

338
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,720
<8-8,Leonard>就出卖自己的肉体呢
<8-8,Leonard>just so we can get some new equipment.

339
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,690
<8-9,Sheldon>拜托  何乐而不为呢
<8-9,Sheldon>Oh, come on! Why not?

340
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,150
<8-10,Leonard>晚安  谢尔顿
<8-10,Leonard>Good night, sheldon.

341
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,680
<8-11,Sheldon>鉴于你用于毫无意义的自慰所花费的大量时间
<8-11,Sheldon>Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse,

342
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,500
<8-11,Sheldon>不妨考虑一下  就这一次
<8-11,Sheldon>you might consider, just this once,

343
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,150
<8-11,Sheldon>让自己的生殖器达到真正合体的高潮
<8-11,Sheldon>using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!

344
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,760
<8-12,Penny>他还是不愿意献身给那个老女人  对吧
<8-12,Penny>He still won't shag the old lady, huh?

<9-8,Mrs Latham>- Really? - Well, of course.

358
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,700
<9-8,Mrs Latham>现在又不是等价交换
<9-8,Mrs Latham>There's no quid pro quo here.

359

<9-8,Mrs Latham>你和你的同事们从事的研究十分杰出
<9-8,Mrs Latham>You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research,

<9-13,Leonard>谢谢
<9-13,Leonard>Thank you.

367
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,330
<9-14,Mrs Latham>我真傻  以为像你这样血气方刚的年轻人
<9-14,Mrs Latham>It was foolish of me to think someone your age

368
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,310
<9-14,Mrs Latham>会对我这样熟透的大龄熟女感兴趣
<9-14,Mrs Latham>might ever be interested in someone like me.

369
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,750
<9-15,Leonard>别这么说
<9-15,Leonard>Oh, don't say that.

<9-15,Leonard>-你是一个很魅力的女人  -拜托
<9-15,Leonard>- You're a very attractive woman. - Oh, please.

<9-17,Leonard>-我是说真的  -你小嘴真甜
<9-17,Leonard>- No, it's true. - Well, aren't you sweet.

372
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,450
<9-18,Mrs Latham>我得重申一遍
<9-18,Mrs Latham>Just for the record...

373
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,680
<9-18,Mrs Latham>与妾共度一夜  君将余生齿颊留香
<9-18,Mrs Latham>you'd remember a night with me for the rest of your life.

374
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,400
<9-19,Leonard>那是当然
<9-19,Leonard>I'm sure I would.

375
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,760
<9-19,Leonard>不过为什么这么说
<9-19,Leonard>But why-why, exactly?

376
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,080
<9-20,Mrs Latham>你是个聪明人
<9-20,Mrs Latham>You're a very smart man.

377
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,970
<9-20,Mrs Latham>你认为我得有多大的本事  才能傍上一个这么有钱的丈夫
<9-20,Mrs Latham>How do you think I landed such a rich husband?

378
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,080
<9-21,Leonard>我还真没想过这个问题
<9-21,Leonard>I hadn't really given it much thought.

379
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,020
<9-22,Mrs Latham>那好好想想吧
<9-22,Mrs Latham>Well, think about it.

380
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,680
<9-23,Leonard>难不成你是指
<9-23,Leonard>Do you mean...?

381
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,310
<9-24,Mrs Latham>正确  老娘就是有本事让男人爽
<9-24,Mrs Latham>Yep. I'm that good.

382
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,200

385
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,250
<10-3,Penny>拜托  我一眼就看出来了  你的步伐充满羞愧
<10-3,Penny>Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it.

386
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,950
<10-3,Penny>你缺少的只是花掉的睫毛膏
<10-3,Penny>All you're missing is a little smeared mascara

387
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,520
<10-3,Penny>和卷成一团塞在坤包里的小裤裤
<10-3,Penny>and a purse with panties wadded up in it.

388
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,490
<10-4,Sheldon>-发生什么事了  -没事
<10-4,Sheldon>- What's going on? - Oh, nothing's going on.

389
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,390
<10-5,Leonard>借光
<10-5,Leonard>Excuse me.

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,320
<10-6,Sheldon>-你才回来  -是
<10-6,Sheldon>- Are you just getting home? - Yeah.

391
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,310
<10-8,Sheldon>这是个好兆头  对吧
<10-8,Sheldon>That's a good sign, right?

392
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,280
<10-9,Penny>的确
<10-9,Penny>Oh, yeah.

393
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,300
<10-10,Sheldon>我为你而自豪
<10-10,Sheldon>I'm so proud of you!

394
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,620
<10-10,Sheldon>你就像普通站街女一样
<10-10,Sheldon>You sold yourself out

395
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,040
<10-10,Sheldon>出卖了自己的肉体
<10-10,Sheldon>like a common streetwalker!

396
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,330
<10-11,Leonard>不  我不是为了钱而做
<10-11,Leonard>No, I didn't do it for the money.

397
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,310
<10-12,Sheldon>她爽完就跑了
<10-12,Sheldon>She stiffed you?

398
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,120
<10-13,Penny>我认为应该是你的室友这么对人家吧
<10-13,Penny>I believe that's what your roommate did to her.

399
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,440
<10-14,Sheldon>搞毛啊
<10-14,Sheldon>What?!

400
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,790
<10-15,Penny>再说一遍  多读读我们给你那本书
<10-15,Penny>Again, read the book we gave you.

401
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,570
<10-16,Leonard>不是这样的  我是说
<10-16,Leonard>No, I mean,

402
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,310
<10-16,Leonard>她一开始就把钱给我了
<10-16,Leonard>I-I got the money first.

403
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,010
<10-17,Sheldon>聪明  先收钱后办事
<10-17,Sheldon>Smart. Get paid up front.

404
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,170
<10-17,Sheldon>我发现你有当小白脸的潜质呀  莱纳德
<10-17,Sheldon>Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.

405
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,170
<10-18,Leonard>我要进去歇着
<10-18,Leonard>I'm gonna go lie down.

406
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,620
<10-19,Sheldon>这个主意不错  养精蓄锐
<10-19,Sheldon>That's a good idea; get your rest.

407
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,540
<10-19,Sheldon>外面有大把有钱又饥渴的老女人
<10-19,Sheldon>There are a lot more rich old ladies out there,

408
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,300
<10-19,Sheldon>而哥正好需要一台新的直线加速器
<10-19,Sheldon>and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator.

409
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,590
<10-19,Sheldon>亏我当时还觉得
<10-19,Sheldon>And I thought he didn't

410
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,170
<10-19,Sheldon>他没有从你们的恋爱中学到任何东西
<10-19,Sheldon>learn anything from his relationship with you.

411
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,190
<10-20,Penny>说啥呢
<10-20,Penny>Hey!

412
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,300
<10-21,Sheldon>这是赞美
<10-21,Sheldon>Another compliment!

413
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,990
<10-21,Sheldon>你得学着去识别
<10-21,Sheldon>Learn to recognize them.

414

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,010
<11-2,Leonard>我真不是为了钱
<11-2,Leonard>I didn't do it for the money!

418
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,600
<11-3,Seibert>这样自我安慰也不错  至少能让你好过点
<11-3,Seibert>Keep telling yourself that-- it makes it easier.

419
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,230
<11-3,Seibert>相信我  我深有体会
<11-3,Seibert>Trust me, I know.
