1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,130
<1-1,Howard>两年之后  突然有人敲门了
<1-1,Howard>So two years later, there's a knock on the door.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,300
<1-1,Howard>那人打开门  看见门口立着只蜗牛
<1-1,Howard>Guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,360
<1-1,Howard>蜗牛说  "这TM是怎么回事?"
<1-1,Howard>who says, "What the heck was all that about?"

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,660
<1-2,Bernadette>我不知道笑点在哪儿
<1-2,Bernadette>I don't really get it.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,000
<1-3,Howard>你看  蜗牛花了两年的时间才...
<1-3,Howard>Well, see, it took two years for the snail to...

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,300
<1-3,Howard>那不重要
<1-3,Howard>Not important.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
<1-4,Bernadette>-我能问你个问题吗  -当然
<1-4,Bernadette>- Can I ask you a question?  - Sure.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,860
<1-6,Bernadette>你认为我们会发展到什么程度
<1-6,Bernadette>Where do you think this is going?

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,260
<1-7,Howard>老实说  我本来希望至少上个二垒
<1-7,Howard>To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,260
<1-8,Bernadette>你真风趣
<1-8,Bernadette>You're so funny.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,700
<1-8,Bernadette>你就像是个单口相声演员
<1-8,Bernadette>You're like a stand-up comedian.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,730
<1-9,Howard>一个犹太单口相声演员  这很新鲜
<1-9,Howard>A Jewish stand-up comedian, that'd be new.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,760
<1-10,Bernadette>事实上  我觉得他们当中很多都是犹太人
<1-10,Bernadette>Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,800
<1-11,Howard>不  我只是  算了
<1-11,Howard>No, I was just... Never mind.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,630
<1-12,Bernadette>霍华德  这是我们的第三次约会
<1-12,Bernadette>Look, Howard, this is our third date

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,660
<1-12,Bernadette>我们都知道这意味着什么
<1-12,Bernadette>and we both know what that means.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,630
<1-13,Howard>-都知道吗  -性
<1-13,Howard>- We do?  - Sex.

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,800
<1-15,Howard>你开玩笑的吧
<1-15,Howard>You're kidding.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,500
<1-16,Bernadette>但我需要知道你是要谈
<1-16,Bernadette>But I need to know whether you're looking

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,360
<1-16,Bernadette>一场恋爱还是要一夜情
<1-16,Bernadette>for a relationship or a one-night stand.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,200
<1-17,Howard>好的  只是搞清楚点
<1-17,Howard>Okay, just to be clear:

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
<1-17,Howard>这个问题只有一个正确答案吗
<1-17,Howard>there's only one correct answer, right?

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
<1-17,Howard>而不是飞机选餐里的要"鸡肉还是鱼肉"
<1-17,Howard>It's not like "chicken or fish" on an airplane?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,230
<1-18,Bernadette>也许你需要认真思考一下这个问题了
<1-18,Bernadette>Maybe you need to think about it a little.

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,360
<1-19,Howard>也不是没有过
<1-19,Howard>You know, it's not unheard of

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,500
<1-19,Howard>从一夜情发展为恋爱关系的事
<1-19,Howard>for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,830
<1-20,Bernadette>等你想明白了再给我打电话
<1-20,Bernadette>Call me when you figure it out.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,630
<1-21,Howard>三次约会意味着性
<1-21,Howard>Three dates means sex?

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,760
<1-21,Howard>谁知道啊
<1-21,Howard>Who knew?

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,230
<2-1,Howard>向你致敬  宅男
<2-1,Howard>Greetings, homies.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,460
<2-1,Howard>宅女
<2-1,Howard>Homette.

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,000
<2-2,Penny>为什么这么早就结束约会回来了
<2-2,Penny>Why are you back from your date so early?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,800
<2-3,Howard>谈恋爱  就要跟在娱乐业一样
<2-3,Howard>In romance, as in show business,

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,330
<2-3,Howard>总是要让观众欲求不满
<2-3,Howard>always leave them wanting more.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,030
<2-4,Penny>这到底是什么意思
<2-4,Penny>What exactly does that mean?

36
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,060
<2-5,Leonard>他被三振出局了
<2-5,Leonard>He struck out.

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,810
<2-5,Leonard>生活大爆炸
<2-5,Leonard>第三季第九集

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,760
<3-1,Howard>你们两个知道
<3-1,Howard>Hey, did either of you guys know

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,400
<3-2,Raj>与同一个女人约会三次
<3-2,Raj>that three dates with the same woman

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,300
<3-1,Howard>就可以上床的临界点?
<3-1,Howard>is the threshold for sex?

41
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,400
<3-2,Raj>事实上  我从未与同一女人约会三次
<3-2,Raj>Actually, I've never had three dates with the same woman.

42
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,930
<3-3,Leonard>而我和佩妮花了两年
<3-3,Leonard>With Penny and me, it took two years.

43
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,800
<3-3,Leonard>现在认真回想一下  的确是三次约会
<3-3,Leonard>Now that I think about it, that was three dates.

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,600
<3-4,Howard>好吧  那在你和佩妮搞上之前
<3-4,Howard>Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up,

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,060
<3-4,Howard>她有没有要求什么承诺
<3-4,Howard>Did she ask for any kind of commitment?

46
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,200
<3-5,Leonard>没  她倒是非常清楚地表示
<3-5,Leonard>No, she was pretty clear about

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
<3-5,Leonard>要有保持随时换人的权力
<3-5,Leonard>wanting to keep her options open.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,330
<3-6,Sheldon (arriving)>我有东西要宣布一下
<3-6,Sheldon (arriving)>I have something to announce,

49
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,800
<3-6,Sheldon (arriving)>但是出于惯例  我会等你们
<3-6,Sheldon (arriving)>but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
<3-6,Sheldon (arriving)>说完现在的话题
<3-6,Sheldon (arriving)>to finish your current conversation.

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,260
<3-6,Sheldon (arriving)>你们在聊什么呢
<3-6,Sheldon (arriving)>What are you talking about?

52
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,460
<3-7,Leonard>一种文化模式
<3-7,Leonard>The cultural paradigm in which people have sex

53
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,760
<3-7,Leonard>就是人们会在三次约会后做爱
<3-7,Leonard>after three dates.

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,100
<3-8,Sheldon>原来如此
<3-8,Sheldon>I see.

55
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,300
<3-8,Sheldon>现在我们是说的"date"是指社交活动
<3-8,Sheldon>Now, are we talking "date," the social interaction,

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,760
<3-8,Sheldon>还是指干枣
<3-8,Sheldon>or "date," the dried fruit?

57
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,530
<3-9,Leonard>算了  你要宣布什么
<3-9,Leonard>Never mind, what's your announcement?

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,000
<3-10,Sheldon>很好  轮到我了  这令人非常兴奋
<3-10,Sheldon>Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,060
<3-10,Sheldon>并且我想让你们最先知道
<3-10,Sheldon>and I wanted you to be among the first to know...

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,200
<3-11,Kripke>嗨  库珀
<3-11,Kripke>Hey, Cooper.

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
<3-11,Kripke>我听说你下周要和《科学星期五》的
<3-11,Kripke>I hear you're going to be on the radio

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,230
<3-11,Kripke>艾拉·弗雷托上广播节目
<3-11,Kripke>with Ira Flatow from Science Friday next week.

63
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,860
<3-12,Sheldon>谢谢  克瑞普克  剥夺了我跟我的朋友
<3-12,Sheldon>Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity

64
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,100
<3-12,Sheldon>分享这则新闻的机会
<3-12,Sheldon>to share my news with my friends.

65
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,030
<3-13,Kripke>很荣幸
<3-13,Kripke>My pleasure.

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,860
<3-14,Sheldon>我的"谢谢"可不是诚恳的
<3-14,Sheldon>My "thank you" was not sincere.

67
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,300
<3-14,Sheldon>但我的"很荣幸"是的
<3-14,Sheldon>But "my pleasure" is.

68
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,350
<3-15,Kripke>让我问你个问题
<3-15,Kripke>Let me ask you a question:

69
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,330
<3-15,Kripke>什么时候国家公共广播
<3-15,Kripke>At what point did National Public Radio

70
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,260
<3-15,Kripke>不得不邀请一些废材
<3-15,Kripke>have to start scraping the bottom of the barrel

71
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,930
<3-15,Kripke>作为嘉宾呢
<3-15,Kripke>for its guests?

72
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,760
<3-16,Sheldon>别回答  这是个比喻
<3-16,Sheldon>Don't answer. It's rhetorical.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,900
<3-16,Sheldon>为什么你是个笨蛋
<3-16,Sheldon>Why are you such a stupid head?

74
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,630
<3-16,Sheldon>这也是个比喻
<3-16,Sheldon>That is also rhetorical.

75
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,500
<3-16,Sheldon>真抱歉你们不得不听到这些
<3-16,Sheldon>I'm sorry you had to hear that.

76
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,600
<3-17,Leonard>你真的要上国家公共广播吗
<3-17,Leonard>Are you really going to be on NPR?

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,530
<3-18,Sheldon>没错  他们通过我办公室的电话采访我
<3-18,Sheldon>Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office,

78
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,560
<3-18,Sheldon>问一些最近所谓的"发现"
<3-18,Sheldon>regarding the recent so-called "discovery"

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,930
<3-18,Sheldon>关于自旋冰中的磁单极子
<3-18,Sheldon>of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices.

80
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,700
<3-18,Sheldon>因为是誓言周  他们想通过一些辩论
<3-18,Sheldon>It's pledge week and they're trying to goose the ratings

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,460
<3-18,Sheldon>来提高收听率
<3-18,Sheldon>with a little controversy.

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,900
<3-19,Leonard>真酷  恭喜你
<3-19,Leonard>Very cool, congratulations.

83
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,130
<3-20,Sheldon>谢谢  我妈妈也非常兴奋
<3-20,Sheldon>Thank you. My mother is very excited.

84
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,030
<3-20,Sheldon>她召集了她的圣经学习小组来收听
<3-20,Sheldon>She's convening her Bible study group to listen in,

85
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,500
<3-20,Sheldon>然后为我的灵魂祈祷
<3-20,Sheldon>and then pray for my soul.

86
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,830
<3-21,Raj>我曾经上过一次电台
<3-21,Raj>I was on the radio once.

87
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,130
<3-21,Raj>我打进了新德里的狂热FM104的热线
<3-21,Raj>I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi

88
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,560
<3-21,Raj>成为了第四个说一句话就能拿钱的人
<3-21,Raj>and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays:

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,260
<3-21,Raj>"狂热104   aajke naye  acchha sangeetka ghar."
<3-21,Raj>"Fever 104, aajke naye  acchha sangeetka ghar."

90
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,700
<3-21,Raj>意思是  "狂热104
<3-21,Raj>That means: "Fever 104,

91
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,230
<3-21,Raj>超棒流行音乐之家
<3-21,Raj>home of the really good current music."

92
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,600
<3-21,Raj>还是在印度语里说更拉风
<3-21,Raj>It's much catchier in Hindi.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,200
<4-1,Sheldon>好的  这些是明天上国家公共广播
<4-1,Sheldon>All right. These are the talking points

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,830
<4-1,Sheldon>访谈的讲点
<4-1,Sheldon>for my NPR interview tomorrow.

95
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,830
<4-1,Sheldon>我必须确定它们对于那些
<4-1,Sheldon>I need to make sure that they're simple enough

96
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,060
<4-1,Sheldon>教育程度较低的听众来说也足够简单易懂
<4-1,Sheldon>for the less educated in the audience to understand.

97
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,700
<4-3,Sheldon>霍华德  看一遍然后告诉我你哪里不懂
<4-3,Sheldon>Howard, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.

98
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,300
<4-2,Howard>劳驾  我有麻省理工大学的
<4-2,Howard>Excuse me, I have a master's degree in engineering

99
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,400
<4-2,Howard>工程硕士学位证书
<4-2,Howard>from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,100
<4-2,Howard>要求修完144个学分
<4-2,Howard>It required the completion of 144 units of grad work

101
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,530
<4-2,Howard>和一篇原创论文
<4-2,Howard>and an original thesis.

102
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,130
<4-2,Howard>没错
<4-2,Howard>Yes.

103
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,660
<4-3,Sheldon>看完告诉我有哪些不清楚的
<4-3,Sheldon>Look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.

104
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,360
<4-4,Leonard>谢尔顿让你做事
<4-4,Leonard>You know, when Sheldon gives you homework,

105
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,260
<4-4,Leonard>你可以拒绝
<4-4,Leonard>you don't have to do it.

106
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,960
<4-5,Raj>其实你拒绝更好
<4-5,Raj>In fact, it's better if you don't,

107
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,200
<4-5,Raj>不然搞得我们几个很尴尬
<4-5,Raj>otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
<4-6,Penny>-各位好  -你好
<4-6,Penny>- Hi, guys. - Hey. Hello.

109
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,300
<4-8,Sheldon>拉杰  跟我说话
<4-8,Sheldon>Yo, Raj, talk to me.

110
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,330
<4-9,Penny>抱歉  耍你而已
<4-9,Penny>I'm sorry, just screwing with you.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,630
<4-9,Penny>霍华德  你干嘛不打电话给伯纳黛特
<4-9,Penny>Hey, Howard, why haven't you called Bernadette?

112
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,130
<4-10,Howard>她说什么了吗
<4-10,Howard>Did she say something?

113
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,830
<4-11,Penny>她说你一个星期没跟她联系了
<4-11,Penny>Yeah, she said she hasn't heard from you in a week.

114
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,030
<4-11,Penny>我以为你喜欢她呢
<4-11,Penny>I thought you liked her?

115
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,430
<4-12,Howard>是喜欢  但她要我给个承诺
<4-12,Howard>I do, but she wants a commitment

116
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,830
<4-12,Howard>我又不确定她是不是我喜欢的类型
<4-12,Howard>and I'm not sure she's my type.

117
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,460
<4-13,Penny>她都愿意免费跟你约会
<4-13,Penny>She agreed to go out with you for free.

118
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,130
<4-13,Penny>你还想怎么样
<4-13,Penny>What more do you need?

119
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,530
<4-14,Howard>伯纳黛特是很好
<4-14,Howard>Look, Bernadette is really nice.

120
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,800
<4-14,Howard>我只是一直觉得  当我想认真的对待感情时
<4-14,Howard>I just always thought when I finally settle down

121
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,960
<4-14,Howard>对方应该是一个
<4-14,Howard>into a relationship, it would be with someone,

122
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,730
<4-14,Howard>你知道  一个特别的人
<4-14,Howard>you know, different.

123
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,230
<4-15,Penny>怎么特别
<4-15,Penny>Different how?

124
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,430
<4-16,Howard>更像《变形金刚》里的梅根·福克斯啦
<4-16,Howard>Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers.

125
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,500
<4-16,Howard>或者《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》里的
<4-16,Howard>Or Katee Sackhoff

126
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,430
<4-16,Howard>凯蒂·萨克霍夫啦
<4-16,Howard>from Battlestar Galactica.

127
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,830
<4-17,Penny>你嗑药啦
<4-17,Penny>Are you high?

128
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,400
<4-18,Leonard>你跟《宇宙威龙》里有三个咪咪的
<4-18,Leonard>You'd have a better shot with the three-breasted

129
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,900
<4-18,Leonard>火星妓女在一起的可能性更大点
<4-18,Leonard>Martian hooker from Total Recall.

130
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,830
<4-19,Howard>你说的太不实际了
<4-19,Howard>Okay, now you're just being unrealistic.

131
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,360
<4-19,Howard>那部电影都差不多20年了
<4-19,Howard>Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago.

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,030
<4-19,Howard>想想那些咪咪该下垂成什么样了
<4-19,Howard>Imagine how saggy those thing would be.

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,500
<4-20,Penny>霍华德  你想守着你的荒诞幻想不放
<4-20,Penny>Howard, you're going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette

134
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,160
<4-20,Penny>而放过像伯纳黛特这么好的女生吗
<4-20,Penny>because you're holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?

135
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,100
<4-21,Howard>你的感情定下来了不代表我也要这样吧
<4-21,Howard>Hey, just because you settled doesn't mean I have to.

136
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,930
<4-22,Leonard>喂  我在这坐着呢
<4-22,Leonard>Excuse me, I'm sitting here.

137
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,000
<4-23,Penny>我又没有和莱纳德定下来
<4-23,Penny>Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,200
<4-23,Penny>他显然不像我通常约会的类型
<4-23,Penny>I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with...

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,600
<4-23,Penny>体格上不像
<4-23,Penny>you know, physically.

140
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,900
<4-24,Leonard>再说一次  我在呢
<4-24,Leonard>Again, I'm right here.

141
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,000
<4-25,Penny>我的意思是  我不会以封面断定书的好坏
<4-25,Penny>My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,660
<4-25,Penny>我更在意人的内心
<4-25,Penny>I am interested in the person underneath.

143
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,060
<4-26,Leonard>我在这吧  你看得见我
<4-26,Leonard>I am here, right? You see me.

144
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,430
<4-27,Howard>我也在意人的内心啊
<4-27,Howard>Hey, I'm interested in what's inside people, too,

145
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,660
<4-27,Howard>但是希望内心外面包装点像
<4-27,Howard>but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in,

146
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,330
<4-27,Howard>哈莉·贝瑞（肤色黑）的巧克力不对吗
<4-27,Howard>say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?

147
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,760
<4-27,Howard>对  你也是巧克力装
<4-27,Howard>Yes, you're delicious caramel, too.

148
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,360
<4-28,Penny>行  我告诉为什么不对
<4-28,Penny>All right, you know what, I will tell you

149
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,000
<4-29,Sheldon>抱歉  我能插下话吗
<4-29,Sheldon>why it's wrong... Excuse me, may I interject?

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
<4-30,Penny>干嘛
<4-30,Penny>What?

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,860
<4-31,Sheldon>从生物学角度上说
<4-31,Sheldon>Biologically speaking,

152
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,900
<4-31,Sheldon>霍华德想找最佳伴侣繁殖后代
<4-31,Sheldon>Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate

153
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,560
<4-31,Sheldon>完全合情合理
<4-31,Sheldon>for the propagation of his genetic line.

154
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,760
<4-32,Howard>-谢谢  谢尔顿  -不过
<4-32,Howard>- Thank you, Sheldon. - Now, whether that

155
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,930
<4-33,Sheldon>但这种繁殖如果站在人类进化的角度来看
<4-33,Sheldon>propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course,

156
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,760
<4-33,Sheldon>又是完全不同的问题
<4-33,Sheldon>an entirely different question.

157
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,300
<5-1,Radio>我是艾拉·弗莱托
<5-1,Radio>This is Ira Flatow and you're listening

158
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,230
<5-1,Radio>您正在收听的是公共广播电台的周五科学
<5-1,Radio>to NPR's Science Friday.

159
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,700
<5-1,Radio>今晚跟我们电话连线的是
<5-1,Radio>Joining us today by phone

160
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
<5-1,Radio>在加州帕萨迪纳办公室里的
<5-1,Radio>from his office in Pasadena, California

161
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,230
<5-1,Radio>谢尔顿·库珀博士
<5-1,Radio>is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

162
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,960
<5-2,Kripke>这个肯定很好玩
<5-2,Kripke>Oh, this is going to be a riot.

163
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,500
<5-3,Radio>欢迎参加我们的节目  库珀博士
<5-3,Radio>Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

164
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,160
<5-4,Sheldon>我很荣幸  艾拉
<5-4,Sheldon>My pleasure, Ira.

165
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,130
<5-5,Ira>我们讨论一下磁单极子吧
<5-5,Ira>Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles.

166
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,160
<5-5,Ira>你能给听众解释一下什么是磁单极子吗
<5-5,Ira>Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,330
<5-5,Ira>当然可以
<5-5,Ira>Of course.

168
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,730
<5-6,Sheldon>首先  一块普通的磁铁
<5-6,Sheldon>First, consider an ordinary magnet which has,

169
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,360
<5-6,Sheldon>即使教育程度再低的听众
<5-6,Sheldon>as even the most uneducated

170
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,130
<5-6,Sheldon>都应该知道  有两个磁极
<5-6,Sheldon>in your audience must know, two poles.

171
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,230
<5-6,Sheldon>南极和北极
<5-6,Sheldon>A north and south pole.

172
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,730
<5-6,Sheldon>把磁铁切成两半  则变成较小的两块磁铁
<5-6,Sheldon>If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets,

173
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,460
<5-6,Sheldon>每块都有南北两极
<5-6,Sheldon>each with its own north and south pole.

174
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,460
<5-7,Ira>库珀博士  我们的连线
<5-7,Ira>Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be

175
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,960
<5-7,Ira>可能出了点问题
<5-7,Ira>something wrong with our connection.

176
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,330
<5-8,Sheldon (even higher pitch)>不  我听得很清楚
<5-8,Sheldon (even higher pitch)>No, I hear you fine.

177
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,460
<5-8,Sheldon (even higher pitch)>正如我刚刚说的  普通磁铁有两个磁极
<5-8,Sheldon (even higher pitch)>As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles.

178
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,030
<5-8,Sheldon (even higher pitch)>磁单极子的主要特征是
<5-8,Sheldon (even higher pitch)>The primary characteristic of a monopole

179
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,600
<5-8,Sheldon (even higher pitch)>它只有一个磁极  因此称为磁单极子
<5-8,Sheldon (even higher pitch)>is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

180
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,230
<5-9,Sheldon>弦理论  或者说M理论
<5-9,Sheldon>A requirement for string theory,

181
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,160
<5-9,Sheldon>的一个必要条件
<5-9,Sheldon>or M-theory, if you will,

182
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,960
<5-9,Sheldon>是存在磁单极子
<5-9,Sheldon>is the existence of such monopoles.

183
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,200
<5-9,Sheldon>我本人曾带领一个考察队
<5-9,Sheldon>I, myself, led an expedition

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,300
<5-9,Sheldon>前往北极圈探寻这种粒子
<5-9,Sheldon>to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles.

185
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,930
<5-9,Sheldon>克瑞普克  我看到喷嘴了  你死定了
<5-9,Sheldon>Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

186
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,600
<6-1,Howard>真高兴你今晚能和我共浴
<6-1,Howard>So nice you could join me this evening.

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,800
<6-1,Howard>你跟往常一样漂亮
<6-1,Howard>You're looking lovely as always.

188
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,530
<6-2,Katee Sackhoff>过奖  霍华德
<6-2,Katee Sackhoff>Thanks, Howard.

189
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,330
<6-2,Katee Sackhoff>一向乐意加入你的手淫幻想
<6-2,Katee Sackhoff>Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.

190
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,660
<6-3,Howard>别这样嘛  凯蒂
<6-3,Howard>Come on, Katee.

191
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,360
<6-3,Howard>何必说得这么低俗呢
<6-3,Howard>Don't make it sound so cheap.

192
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,800
<6-4,Katee>抱歉  在浴缸里自欺欺人
<6-4,Katee>I'm sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub

193
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,660
<6-4,Katee>确实是出类拔萃的行为
<6-4,Katee>is a real class act.

194
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
<6-4,Katee>谢谢
<6-4,Katee>Thank you.

195
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,230
<6-5,Howard>我们可以开始了吗
<6-5,Howard>So, shall we get started?

196
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,200
<6-5,Howard>当然
<6-5,Howard>Sure.

197
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,060
<6-6,Katee>但我能先问你个问题吗
<6-6,Katee>But can I ask you a question first?

198
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,500
<6-7,Howard>你想扮演赛昂人和殖民者吗
<6-7,Howard>Do you want to play Cylon and colonist?

199
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,860
<6-7,Howard>不
<6-7,Howard>No.

200
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,700
<6-8,Katee>我很奇怪  你明明可以和真人约会
<6-8,Katee>I want to know why you're playing make-believe with me

201
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,600
<6-8,Katee>却在这里和我玩性幻想游戏
<6-8,Katee>when you could be out with a real woman tonight.

202
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,700
<6-9,Howard>你是指伯纳黛特吗
<6-9,Howard>You mean, Bernadette?

203
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
<6-10,Katee>不  我是指莱娅公主(星战人物  路克·天行者的双胞胎妹妹)
<6-10,Katee>No, I mean Princess Leia.

204
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,530
<6-10,Katee>我当然指的是伯纳黛特
<6-10,Katee>Of course I mean Bernadette.

205
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,700
<6-10,Katee>她是个很好的女孩儿  真的喜欢你
<6-10,Katee>She's a wonderful girl and she really likes you.

206
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,500
<6-11,Howard>我知道  但她不是你
<6-11,Howard>I know, but she's not you.

207
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,800
<6-12,Katee>我又不是真实的
<6-12,Katee>I'm not me.

208
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,830
<6-12,Katee>真正的我现正在比弗利山庄
<6-12,Katee>The real me is in Beverly Hills

209
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,530
<6-12,Katee>和某个英俊高大的有钱人约会呢
<6-12,Katee>Going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.

210
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,800
<6-13,Howard>真的吗  很高大吗
<6-13,Howard>Really? Tall?

211
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,460
<6-14,Katee>-一米九三呢  -哇哦
<6-14,Katee>- Six-four. - Ouch.

212
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,100
<6-16,Katee>问题在于  你遇到了一个好女孩
<6-16,Katee>The point is, you've got a wonderful girl in your life,

213
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,030
<6-16,Katee>但却宁愿整晚在浴缸里对着虚拟影像
<6-16,Katee>And you're ignoring her in order to spend your nights

214
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,230
<6-16,Katee>和浴巾性幻想  也不去理她
<6-16,Katee>in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.

215
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,300
<6-16,Katee>霍华德
<6-16,Katee>Howard!

216
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,530
<6-17,Howard’s Mother>你到底在里面干嘛
<6-17,Howard’s Mother>What are you doing in there?

217
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,460
<6-18,Howard>我在洗澡
<6-18,Howard>I'm taking a bath!

218
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,530
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>你可别做啥其他猥琐的事
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>I hope that's all you're doing!

219
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,660
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>那浴缸我也要用
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>We share that tub!

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>别提醒我
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>Don't remind me!

221
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,560
<6-20,Howard>老天
<6-20,Howard>Oh, man.

222
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,300
<6-20,Howard>都是泡泡  没有我子孙的容身之地了
<6-20,Howard>All soaped up and no place to go.

223
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,430
<7-1,Leonard>哥们儿  你还好吧
<7-1,Leonard>How ya doin', buddy?

224
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,000
<7-2,Sheldon>我在国家电台上被当众羞辱
<7-2,Sheldon>I was humiliated on national radio.

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,160
<7-2,Sheldon>能好受才怪
<7-2,Sheldon>How do you think I'm doing?

226
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,960
<7-3,Leonard>拜托  没这么夸张吧
<7-3,Leonard>Come on, it wasn't that bad.

227
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,700
<7-4,Sheldon>你们来干嘛
<7-4,Sheldon>What do you want?

228
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,860
<7-5,Raj (in a munchkin voice)>(绿野仙踪中的麦琪肯人欢迎多萝西)

230
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,800
<7-6,Leonard>好啊  克瑞普克捉弄了你一下
<7-6,Leonard>Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.

231
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,100
<7-7,Sheldon>不好笑
<7-7,Sheldon>It wasn't funny.

232
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,160
<7-8,Raj>-我觉得很好笑  -拉杰
<7-8,Raj>- I thought it was funny. - Raj.

233
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,500
<7-10,Raj>你也笑了啊
<7-10,Raj>You laughed.

234
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,330
<7-11,Sheldon>你笑了吗
<7-11,Sheldon>Did you laugh?

235
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,730
<7-12,Leonard>我笑得滚到地板上了
<7-12,Leonard>I fell on the floor.

236
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,700
<7-12,Leonard>好吧  这次是他赢了
<7-12,Leonard>All right, he got you.

237
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
<7-12,Leonard>你可以以牙还牙嘛
<7-12,Leonard>You can get him back.

238
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,330
<7-13,Sheldon>我才不要堕落到他那种水准
<7-13,Sheldon>I refuse to sink to his level.

239
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,500
<7-14,Raj>你落不了  体内充满了氦气
<7-14,Raj>You can't sink. With all that helium in you,

240
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,700
<7-14,Raj>遇水不飘走就算你走运啦
<7-14,Raj>you're lucky you don't float away.

241
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,830
<7-15,Leonard>你当真认栽了吗
<7-15,Leonard>Are you really admitting defeat?

242
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,300
<7-16,Sheldon>我从不认栽
<7-16,Sheldon>I never admit defeat.

243
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,460
<7-17,Leonard>很好
<7-17,Leonard>Good.

244
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,700
<7-18,Sheldon>但是  从另一个方面讲
<7-18,Sheldon>However, on an unrelated topic,

245
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,630
<7-18,Sheldon>我再也抬不起头做人了
<7-18,Sheldon>I am never getting out of this bed again.

246
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,730
<7-19,Leonard>那何不这样  你设法捉弄克瑞普克
<7-19,Leonard>What if you could make Kripke

247
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,630
<7-19,Leonard>让他看起来比你更蠢
<7-19,Leonard>look even sillier than he made you look?

248
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,800
<7-20,Raj>我觉得这不可能  老兄
<7-20,Raj>I don't think that's possible, dude.

249
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,230
<7-21,Leonard>你尽说些丧气话
<7-21,Leonard>You're not helping.

250
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,300
<7-22,Raj>我本就不是来说好话  我是来吐糟的
<7-22,Raj>I didn't come to help, I came to mock.

251
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,900
<7-23,Leonard>谢尔顿  你现在得好好想想
<7-23,Leonard>Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way

252
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,730
<7-23,Leonard>到底怎么报复克瑞普克
<7-23,Leonard>to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh,

253
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,200
<7-23,Leonard>好比蝙蝠侠把疯子罪犯小丑扔进了
<7-23,Leonard>like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him

254
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
<7-23,Leonard>亚克汗疯人院  事后他不是越狱了吗
<7-23,Leonard>in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

255
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,900
<7-24,Raj>是啊  他不光是待在里面对其他
<7-24,Raj>That's true. He didn't just stay there and talk about

256
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,300
<7-24,Raj>精神病恶棍大吐苦水
<7-24,Raj>His feelings with the other psychotic villains.

257
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,730
<7-24,Raj>还越狱了  还对哥谭市的供水系统投毒
<7-24,Raj>He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham's water supply.

258
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
<7-25,Sheldon>好吧
<7-25,Sheldon>Well...

259
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,760
<7-25,Sheldon>-那我该给克瑞普克下毒  -不
<7-25,Sheldon>- I suppose I could poison Kripke. - No!

260
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,230
<7-27,Sheldon>不  这其实很简单
<7-27,Sheldon>No. It's a simple matter.

261
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,760
<7-27,Sheldon>有那么几种有毒化学物
<7-27,Sheldon>There are several toxic chemicals

262
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,760
<7-27,Sheldon>尸检是查不出来的
<7-27,Sheldon>that'd be untraceable in an autopsy.

263
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,160
<7-28,Leonard>你抓到了要领
<7-28,Leonard>Okay, uh, that's the spirit,

264
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,530
<7-28,Leonard>但手段可以温柔点
<7-28,Leonard>but, um, let's dial it back

265
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,660
<7-28,Leonard>不要置人于死地
<7-28,Leonard>to a non-lethal form of vengeance.

266
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,130
<7-29,Sheldon>这样  在他的办公室椅子上弄个放屁垫
<7-29,Sheldon>How about we whoopee cushion on his office chair?

267
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,500
<7-29,Sheldon>他一坐下  听起来就像是有胃气胀
<7-29,Sheldon>He'll sit down, it'll sound like

268
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,960
<7-29,Sheldon>尽管他不是真有胃气胀
<7-29,Sheldon>he's flatulent, even though he's not.

269
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,430
<7-30,Leonard>还是再想想吧
<7-30,Leonard>Let's keep thinking.

270
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,730
<8-1,Penny>老兄  你可来晚了
<8-1,Penny>Oh, gee, you're too late.

271
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,100
<8-1,Penny>斯嘉丽·乔纳森和神奇女侠
<8-1,Penny>Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here

272
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,960
<8-1,Penny>刚在这里轮番歌颂神经质和胆小鬼呢
<8-1,Penny>trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.

273
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,830
<8-2,Howard>我来找伯纳黛特  她今天上班吗
<8-2,Howard>I came to talk to Bernadette. She's working today, right?

274
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,330
<8-3,Penny>是啊  但我觉得她不想见你
<8-3,Penny>Yes, but I don't think she wants to see you.

275
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,360
<8-4,Howard>为啥
<8-4,Howard>Why not?

276
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,060
<8-5,Penny>得了  霍华德  你伤害了她
<8-5,Penny>Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings

277
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,500
<8-5,Penny>一个星期都不给人家电话
<8-5,Penny>by not calling her all week.

278
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,900
<8-5,Penny>加上我还说了你不少坏话
<8-5,Penny>Plus, I've kind of been talkin' some smack about ya.

279
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,900
<8-6,Bernadette>好啊  霍华德
<8-6,Bernadette>Hello, Howard.

280
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,030
<8-7,Howard>等下  伯纳黛特  我有话对你说
<8-7,Howard>Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.

281
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,160
<8-8,Bernadette>现在不成  我在工作呢
<8-8,Bernadette>I can't now, I'm working.

282
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,700
<8-9,Howard>就一会儿
<8-9,Howard>This will only take a second.

283
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,460
<8-9,Howard>你之前让我好好考虑
<8-9,Howard>You asked me to think about where

284
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,430
<8-9,Howard>我们之间的关系  好吧我想过了
<8-9,Howard>our relationship was going, and I did.

285
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,200
<8-9,Howard>伯纳黛特
<8-9,Howard>Bernadette?

286
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,500
<8-9,Howard>你愿意嫁给我吗
<8-9,Howard>Will you marry me?

287
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,530
<8-10,Bernadette>我不明白  这算是玩笑吗
<8-10,Bernadette>Is this more comedy that I don't understand?

288
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,500
<8-11,Howard>不  我是认真的
<8-11,Howard>No. I'm serious.

289
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,100
<8-11,Howard>你是我生命中的唯一
<8-11,Howard>I'm never going to find another girl like you

290
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,000
<8-11,Howard>重要的是  你是真心喜欢我
<8-11,Howard>who likes me and is, you know, real.

291
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,430
<8-12,Bernadette>这不是开玩笑吗
<8-12,Bernadette>So, this isn't a joke?

292
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,160
<8-14,Bernadette>-不是  -那你铁定疯了
<8-14,Bernadette>- No. - Then you're insane.

293
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,830
<8-15,Howard>我觉得自己这是突施奇招
<8-15,Howard>I prefer to think of myself as quirky.

294
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,200
<8-16,Bernadette>霍华德  我们只约会了三次
<8-16,Bernadette>Howard, we've only been on three dates.

295
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,300
<8-16,Bernadette>甚至还没上过床
<8-16,Bernadette>We haven't even had sex yet.

296
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
<8-17,Howard>你说得对
<8-17,Howard>Fair enough.

297
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,600
<8-17,Howard>你什么时候下班
<8-17,Howard>When's your break?

298
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,560
<8-19,Howard>好事将成  你们嫉妒我了不是
<8-19,Howard>Don't you just hate when this happens?

299
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,960
<9-1,Sheldon>好了  用这个来复仇如何
<9-1,Sheldon>All right, how's this for revenge?

300
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,430
<9-1,Sheldon>一剂过氧化氢[双氧水]
<9-1,Sheldon>A solution of hydrogen peroxide,

301
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,030
<9-1,Sheldon>加上一剂饱和碘化钾
<9-1,Sheldon>and one of saturated potassium iodide.

302
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,200
<9-2,Raj>这又是什么
<9-2,Raj>What's this?

303
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,400
<9-3,Sheldon>山露汽水[碳酸饮料]
<9-3,Sheldon>Mountain Dew.

304
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,660
<9-3,Sheldon>啊  真是提神醒脑
<9-3,Sheldon>Ahh, refreshing.

305
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,130
<9-3,Sheldon>然后将这两样化学制剂  与普通洗碗剂结合
<9-3,Sheldon>We're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap,

306
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,630
<9-3,Sheldon>就会放热  释放出氧
<9-3,Sheldon>creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.

307
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,500
<9-4,Raj>泡沫复仇记
<9-4,Raj>Foamy vengeance.

308
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,730
<9-5,Sheldon>完全正确
<9-5,Sheldon>Yes, exactly.

309
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,900
<9-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  这招实在是高
<9-6,Leonard>This is brilliant, Sheldon.

310
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,930
<9-6,Leonard>但你怎么布置到克瑞普克的办公室
<9-6,Leonard>How are we going to deploy it in Kripke's office?

311
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,800
<9-7,Sheldon>早就布置好了
<9-7,Sheldon>Already taken care of.

312
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,060
<9-7,Sheldon>注意看
<9-7,Sheldon>Observe.

313
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,900
<9-7,Sheldon>通过迷你摄像头拍摄到的克瑞普克实验室实况
<9-7,Sheldon>This is a live shot of Kripke's lab via a mini webcam

314
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,630
<9-7,Sheldon>拜我偷塞到看门人衬衫口袋里的美钞所赐
<9-7,Sheldon>I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill

315
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,930
<9-7,Sheldon>我才能装了这个迷你摄像头
<9-7,Sheldon>discreetly placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket.

316
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,300
<9-7,Sheldon>与此同时
<9-7,Sheldon>At the same time,

317
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,360
<9-7,Sheldon>还将大量这样的化学制剂
<9-7,Sheldon>I also secured large quantities of these chemicals

318
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,430
<9-7,Sheldon>放到了他的天花板顶上
<9-7,Sheldon>above the tiles in the drop ceiling.

319
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,060
<9-8,Raj>哦  谢尔顿
<9-8,Raj>Oh, Sheldon,

320
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,900
<9-8,Raj>你让我想起年轻时的莱克斯·卢瑟[后成为超人的死敌]
<9-8,Raj>you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.

321
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,060
<9-9,Sheldon>您太过奖了  先生
<9-9,Sheldon>You flatter me, sir.

322
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,300
<9-10,Leonard>-我猜猜  带运动感应器的  -是的
<9-10,Leonard>- Let me guess: motion sensors? - Yes.

323
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,200
<9-11,Sheldon>一旦克瑞普克走到屋子中间
<9-11,Sheldon>The reaction will be triggered

324
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,300
<9-11,Sheldon>感应器就会触发
<9-11,Sheldon>when Kripke reaches the center of the room.

325
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,500
<9-11,Sheldon>木哈哈
<9-11,Sheldon>Mwah, ha, ha.

326
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,800
<9-12,Leonard>我不得不承认  我很佩服你
<9-12,Leonard>I gotta say, I am really impressed.

327
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,660
<9-12,Leonard>这绝对是谢尔顿式的复仇方式
<9-12,Leonard>This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.

328
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,200
<9-13,Sheldon>这招或许技术含量不高
<9-13,Sheldon>It may be low-tech,

329
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,930
<9-13,Sheldon>但我还是坚持认为  放屁坐垫自有其喜剧效应
<9-13,Sheldon>but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,130
<9-14,Raj>克瑞普克来了
<9-14,Raj>Here comes Kripke!

331
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,830
<9-15,Leonard>跟他一起的是谁
<9-15,Leonard>Who is that with him?

332
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,700
<9-16,Raj>我想那是我们大学的校长
<9-16,Raj>I believe that's the president of the university.

333
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,460
<9-17,Leonard>还有理事会成员  快中止  中止
<9-17,Leonard>And the board of directors.Abort! Abort!

334
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,630
<9-18,Sheldon>没有中止程序
<9-18,Sheldon>There is no "abort."

335
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,200
<9-19,Raj>你怎么能不设中止程序
<9-19,Raj>How could you not put in an "abort?"

336
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,600
<9-20,Sheldon>我疏忽了  好了吧
<9-20,Sheldon>I made a boo-boo, all right?

337
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,860
<9-21,Kripke>塞伯特校长  相信理事会将很欣慰地看到
<9-21,Kripke>I think the board will really appreciate

338
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,400
<9-21,Kripke>我们将国安局的拨款运用得如此之好
<9-21,Kripke>how well we're using that NSA grant, President Seibert.

339
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,660
<9-21,Kripke>这里是我们的微电脑控制的等离子...
<9-21,Kripke>Right here we have a micro-controlled plasma...

340
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,030
<9-22,Raj>看上去就像洗衣日那天的恒河
<9-22,Raj>Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.

341
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,700
<9-23,Leonard>至少他们不知道是你干的
<9-23,Leonard>At least they don't know it was you.

342
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,760
<9-23,Leonard>你好  克瑞普克
<9-23,Leonard>Hello, Kripke.

343
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,130
<9-24,Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab)>你此刻遭遇的经典恶作剧
<9-24,Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab)>This classic prank comes to you

344
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,030
<9-24,Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab)>来自恶意复仇的谢尔顿·库珀
<9-24,Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab)>from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper.

345
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,500
<9-24,Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab)>如果你想看看自己那张蠢蛋脸
<9-24,Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab)>If you'd like to see the look on your stupid face,

346
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,000
<9-24,Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab)>这段视频即刻就会上传到YouTube
