1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,740
<1-1,Penny>我之前看了一部电影预告
<1-1,Penny>Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,930
<1-1,Penny>蝙蝠侠怎么可能打得过超人呢
<1-1,Penny>How could Batman possibly fight Superman?

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,390
<1-1,Penny>真是瞎透了
<1-1,Penny>I mean, isn't that dumb?

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,830
<1-2,Bernadette>或许他用了氪气石
<1-2,Bernadette>Maybe he uses Kryptonite.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,340
<1-2,Bernadette>来自超人故乡氪星的一种矿物
<1-2,Bernadette>有令氪星人失去超能力等多种功效

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,340
<1-3,Emily>蝙蝠侠超有钱
<1-3,Emily>Well, Batman's got a lot of money.

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,530
<1-3,Emily>或许他用钱打造出具有类似超人能力的装甲
<1-3,Emily>Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.

8
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,280
<1-4,Penny>不不不不不
<1-4,Penny>No, no, no, no, no.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,810
<1-4,Penny>这样的电影我看过  叫《钢铁侠》
<1-4,Penny>I've seen that movie. It's called Iron Man.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,820
<1-5,Leonard>怎么回事
<1-5,Leonard>What is happening?

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,310
<1-6,Howard>我不知道
<1-6,Howard>I don't know.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,020
<1-7,Raj>但这画面太美了
<1-7,Raj>But it's beautiful.

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,280
<1-8,Penny>而且蝙蝠侠换本·阿弗莱克演了
<1-8,Penny>And now Ben Affleck is Batman?

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,330
<1-9,Emily>他在《恋爱中的莎士比亚》那部里演得很棒
<1-9,Emily>Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,870
<1-10,Penny>我们下次闺蜜之夜应该来看这部
<1-10,Penny>Ooh, we should watch that next girls' night.

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,960
<1-11,Bernadette>我们可以再配上
<1-11,Bernadette>We could do a double feature

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
<1-11,Bernadette>莱昂纳多的《罗密欧与朱丽叶》啊
<1-11,Bernadette>with the Leonardo DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,880
<1-12,Penny>我可乐意看小李子了
<1-12,Penny>Oh, I love me some Leo.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,570
<1-13,Leonard>美景消失了
<1-13,Leonard>And it's gone.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,540
<1-14,Sheldon>大家安安
<1-14,Sheldon>Oh, hello, everyone.

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,950
<1-14,Sheldon>很开心跟大家宣布本皇龙体已有好转
<1-14,Sheldon>I am happy to report I'm feeling much better.

22
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,790
<1-15,Leonard>"恭喜"
<1-15,Leonard>Good for you.

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,900
<1-16,Sheldon>发烧已退  鼻子也通
<1-16,Sheldon>My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free,

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,880
<1-16,Sheldon>痰也清澈得像国家公园里的瀑布水一样
<1-16,Sheldon>and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.

25
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,610
<1-17,Howard>"棒呆了"
<1-17,Howard>Glad to hear it.

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,710
<1-18,Sheldon>明日我就能回归工作岗位了
<1-18,Sheldon>I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,020
<1-19,Raj>"赞"
<1-19,Raj>Yay.

28
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,130
<1-20,Sheldon>大家怎么都不开心呢
<1-20,Sheldon>Well, why isn't everyone happy?

29
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,570
<1-20,Sheldon>你们的小太阳准备重新发光发热啦
<1-20,Sheldon>Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,770
<1-21,Penny>-你真的不知道为什么吗  -不知道
<1-21,Penny>- You really don't know why? - No.

31
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,170
<1-22,Sheldon>但我听出他那声"赞"是在讽刺
<1-22,Sheldon>But I knew that his "yay" was sarcastic.

32
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,190
<1-22,Sheldon>上次出恭时  声响犹如雨打芭蕉的这位
<1-22,Sheldon>Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,360
<1-22,Sheldon>居然还有体力讽刺  不赖嘛
<1-22,Sheldon>sounded like rain on a roof.

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,930
<1-23,Leonard>让我帮忙你回忆一下
<1-23,Leonard>Let me refresh your memory.

35
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,810
<1-24,Sheldon>佩妮
<1-24,Sheldon>Penny,

36
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,230
<1-24,Sheldon>帮我在胸口抹清凉油
<1-24,Sheldon>rub Vicks on my chest.

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,980
<1-25,Penny>谢尔顿  我给你做了早饭
<1-25,Penny>Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast.

38
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,010
<1-25,Penny>铺了床
<1-25,Penny>I made your bed.

39
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,710
<1-25,Penny>检查你嘴里有没有鹅口疮
<1-25,Penny>I checked your mouth for thrush.

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,590
<1-25,Penny>清凉油你可以自己抹
<1-25,Penny>You can rub your own chest.

42
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,070
<1-26,Sheldon>行行行  世上的男人 你都没少摸过
<1-26,Sheldon>Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet,

43
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,800
<1-26,Sheldon>到我这儿就装清纯
<1-26,Sheldon>but draw the line with me.

44
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,040
<1-27,Bernadette>我从公司给你准备了这个康复小袋袋
<1-27,Bernadette>I brought you a little care package from work.

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,480
<1-27,Bernadette>里面有我们最新的抗病毒药
<1-27,Bernadette>It's our latest antiviral

46
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,320
<1-27,Bernadette>还有我们最好的抗鼻塞药
<1-27,Bernadette>and the best decongestant we make.

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,790
<1-28,Sheldon>那我希望笑是最好的药物
<1-28,Sheldon>I hope laughter is the best medicine,

48
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,390
<1-28,Sheldon>因为这包东西根本就是在搞笑
<1-28,Sheldon>'cause this care package is a joke.

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,150
<1-29,Howard>她大老远特意跑来...
<1-29,Howard>Hey, she came all the way here...

50
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,170
<1-30,Bernadette>你记得饭后再吃啊
<1-30,Bernadette>You're gonna want to take these with food.

51
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,040
<1-31,Raj>谢尔顿  别孩子气了
<1-31,Raj>Sheldon, stop being a baby

52
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,900
<1-31,Raj>让艾米丽给你看看嘛
<1-31,Raj>and let Emily take a look at you.

53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,990
<1-32,Sheldon>她是皮肤科医生
<1-32,Sheldon>She's a dermatologist.

54
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,980
<1-33,Emily>我上过医学院啊
<1-33,Emily>I went to medical school.

55
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,600
<1-34,Sheldon>这样的话  那请你把位于你旁边的
<1-34,Sheldon>Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,040
<1-34,Sheldon>那坨烦人棕色皮肤给去除掉
<1-34,Sheldon>of brown skin standing next to you.

57
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,870
<1-35,Leonard>来  吃吧
<1-35,Leonard>All right, here you go.

58
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,240
<1-36,Sheldon>莱纳德  我要死了
<1-36,Sheldon>Leonard, I'm dying.

59
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,770
<1-37,Leonard>你才不会死  只是流感而已
<1-37,Leonard>You're not dying. It's just the flu.

60
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,050
<1-38,Sheldon>我要的是鸡汤面
<1-38,Sheldon>I asked for chicken noodle.

61
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,410
<1-38,Sheldon>这个是鸡与星星状的面  我要气死了
<1-38,Sheldon>This is chicken and stars. It's killing me.

62
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,250
<1-39,Sheldon>我最终还是没吃到鸡汤面不是吗
<1-39,Sheldon>I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?

63
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,830
<1-39,Sheldon>翻译：毒舌呛声赛太公  嫌东嫌西YY猫
<1-39,Sheldon>猫中之王

73
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,290
<2-1,Amy (on Skype)>谢尔顿
<2-1,Amy (on Skype)>Hi, Sheldon.

74
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,220
<2-2,Sheldon>你好啊
<2-2,Sheldon>Hello.

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,210
<2-3,Amy>你身体好点了吗
<2-3,Amy>Are you feeling any better?

76
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,540
<2-4,Sheldon>生理上好点了  但心里不太好
<2-4,Sheldon>Physically, yes, but I'm upset

77
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,440
<2-4,Sheldon>因为大家莫名其妙就不爽我
<2-4,Sheldon>because everyone's mad at me for no good reason.

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,680
<2-5,Amy>你跟我说说发生了什么吧
<2-5,Amy>Why don't you tell me what happened,

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,710
<2-5,Amy>然后我会用温和  慈爱的方式
<2-5,Amy>and in a gentle, loving way,

80
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,010
<2-5,Amy>来跟你解释你为什么错了
<2-5,Amy>I'll explain to you why you're wrong.

81
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,080
<2-6,Sheldon>你知道当人生病的时候
<2-6,Sheldon>You know how, when you're sick,

82
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,320
<2-6,Sheldon>是有权对身旁或任何人耍脾气
<2-6,Sheldon>you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want

83
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,740
<2-6,Sheldon>而且完全不用鸟他们感受的吧
<2-6,Sheldon>and other people's feelings don't matter?

84
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,520
<2-7,Amy>温和慈爱  这有点费劲啊
<2-7,Amy>Gentle and loving-- this is gonna be tricky.

85
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,210
<2-8,Sheldon>我都烧到38.3度了
<2-8,Sheldon>I had a 101 fever.

86
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,320
<2-8,Sheldon>此时不尖酸刻薄对亲朋好友  更待何时
<2-8,Sheldon>If that's not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,640
<2-9,Amy>谢尔顿  当你生病的时候  你会有点...
<2-9,Amy>Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be...

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,750
<2-9,Amy>让人受不了
<2-9,Amy>unbearable.

89
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,700
<2-9,Amy>所以你的小伙伴们
<2-9,Amy>That's why your friends have been known

90
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,210
<2-9,Amy>要么加班  要么溜去看电影
<2-9,Amy>to work late or sneak out to the movies

91
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,550
<2-9,Amy>或者多留在神经生物学大会
<2-9,Amy>or stay at a neurobiology conference

92
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,970
<2-9,Amy>哪怕大会三天前就结束了
<2-9,Amy>three days after it's ended.

93
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,790
<2-10,Sheldon>你多留在密歇根就是为了要躲我吗
<2-10,Sheldon>You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?

94
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,610
<2-11,Amy>不是不是  不止如此
<2-11,Amy>No, no, not just that.

95
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,780
<2-11,Amy>还有...
<2-11,Amy>I mean...

96
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,490
<2-11,Amy>底特律下雨夹雪的时候特美呢
<2-11,Amy>Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.

97
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,910
<2-12,Sheldon>又不是只有我一个人生病时
<2-12,Sheldon>You know, I'm not the only one

98
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,400
<2-12,Sheldon>才这么讨人厌
<2-12,Sheldon>who's unpleasant when they're sick.

99
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,090
<2-12,Sheldon>像佩妮食物中毒的那次  她呕吐声大到
<2-12,Sheldon>When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly

100
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,370
<2-12,Sheldon>我都听不到电视的声音了
<2-12,Sheldon>I could barely hear the television.

101
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,950
<2-13,Amy>我好像听到了什么声音
<2-13,Amy>Ooh, I just heard something.

102
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,560
<2-13,Amy>不知道是冰雹声还是枪声
<2-13,Amy>Might be hail, might be gunfire.

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,790
<2-13,Amy>反正我都要去拍照围观啦  再见
<2-13,Amy>Either way, I'm gonna go take pictures. Bye.

104
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,500
<3-1,Raj>斯图尔特
<3-1,Raj>Hey, Stuart.

105
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,520
<3-2,Stuart>谢尔顿呢
<3-2,Stuart>Hey. Where's Sheldon?

106
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,060
<3-2,Stuart>-还病着呢  -没  已经好了
<3-2,Stuart>- Still sick? - No, he's fine.

107
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,930
<3-3,Leonard>我们只是需要喘口气
<3-3,Leonard>We just needed a little break.

108
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,190
<3-4,Stuart>我理解
<3-4,Stuart>Yeah, I get that.

109
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,710
<3-4,Stuart>我那天送漫画去给他的时候
<3-4,Stuart>When I brought him his comics the other day,

110
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,140
<3-4,Stuart>他说"靠  索命鬼真的来了"
<3-4,Stuart>he said, "Oh, great, Death is literally at my door."

111
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,350
<3-5,Howard>他对每个人都是这么贱
<3-5,Howard>He was being a jerk to everyone.

112
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,700
<3-5,Howard>你别往心里去
<3-5,Howard>Don't take it personally.

113
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,650
<3-6,Stuart>我吃着无数种抗抑郁药
<3-6,Stuart>Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants,

114
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,630
<3-6,Stuart>我就是想难过都没办法
<3-6,Stuart>I couldn't if I wanted to.

115
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,770
<3-7,Raj>真希望我们能甩开谢尔顿做更多事
<3-7,Raj>I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.

116
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,850
<3-8,Leonard>我一直这么真心希望
<3-8,Leonard>I wish that all the time.

117
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,350
<3-8,Leonard>通常都是在我吹熄生日蛋糕之前
<3-8,Leonard>Usually before I blow out birthday candles.

118
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,440
<3-9,Howard>艾米就甩开他休息了一阵子啊
<3-9,Howard>You know, Amy took some time off from him.

119
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,780
<3-9,Howard>感情还因此提升了不少
<3-9,Howard>Really improved their relationship.

120
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,250
<3-9,Howard>行
<3-9,Howard>Okay.

121
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,800
<3-10,Raj>只要最后我们不需要跟他滚床单
<3-10,Raj>As long as it doesn't end with us having coitus with him,

122
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,970
<3-10,Raj>我就加入
<3-10,Raj>I'm in.

123
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,620
<3-11,Howard>我们应该一起去旅游之类的
<3-11,Howard>We should all take a trip or something.

124
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,220
<3-12,Leonard>我跟佩妮谈过
<3-12,Leonard>You know, Penny and I have been talking

125
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,560
<3-12,Leonard>找个周末去赌城玩
<3-12,Leonard>about taking a weekend in Vegas.

126
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,980
<3-12,Leonard>或许我们大伙应该一起去
<3-12,Leonard>Maybe we should all go.

127
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,190
<3-13,Howard>妮妮肯定想去
<3-13,Howard>Bernie would love that.

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,630
<3-14,Raj>或许我们可以叫台派对巴士载我们去
<3-14,Raj>Maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.

129
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,710
<3-15,Leonard>听起来就很有意思
<3-15,Leonard>That sounds really fun.

<3-16,Raj>When I say "party," you say "bus."

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,420
<4-2,Penny>感觉应该挺有意思
<4-2,Penny>Oh, that could be fun.

138
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,280
<4-2,Penny>但我先问清楚  你说派对巴士
<4-2,Penny>But just to be clear, you mean a party bus

139
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,810
<4-2,Penny>是指有酒跟音乐的那种吧
<4-2,Penny>with booze and music, right,

<4-2,Penny>是啦
<4-2,Penny>Yes.

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,880
<4-3,Leonard>你这"家长"明明不用留下的
<4-3,Leonard>You didn't have to stay.

<4-4,Penny>那我加入

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,010
<4-7,Leonard>赌城  但是...
<4-7,Leonard>Well, Vegas, but...

148
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,450
<4-8,Sheldon>没有特产太妃糖的大西洋城[也是赌城]吗
<4-8,Sheldon>Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy?

149
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,990
<4-8,Sheldon>我可不想去
<4-8,Sheldon>No, thank you.

150
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,970
<4-9,Leonard>没关系  其实也没有要邀请你
<4-9,Leonard>That's fine, 'cause actually you're not invited.

151
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,060
<4-10,Sheldon>真的假的  太伤人了
<4-10,Sheldon>Well, now... well, that's hurtful.

152
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,100
<4-11,Penny>谢尔顿  你根本不喜欢那地方
<4-11,Penny>Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.

153
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,780
<4-12,Sheldon>我能把一个地方看做小便池里的芳香剂
<4-12,Sheldon>I can consider a place America's urinal cake

154
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,180
<4-12,Sheldon>但我去的时候也还是尿得享受啊
<4-12,Sheldon>and still enjoy the occasional visit.

155
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,300
<4-13,Leonard>这次不行
<4-13,Leonard>Not this time.

156
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,090
<4-14,Sheldon>算了  那我跟沃罗威茨玩吧
<4-14,Sheldon>Oh, fine. Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,060
<4-15,Leonard>他也去
<4-15,Leonard>He's coming, too.

158
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,480
<4-16,Sheldon>-那我和拉杰...  -他也去
<4-16,Sheldon>- Well, then Raj and I will... - Nope.

159
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,330
<4-18,Sheldon>很好  那我找斯图尔特
<4-18,Sheldon>Very well. Stuart.

160
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,830
<4-19,Leonard>好呀  去吧
<4-19,Leonard>Oh, great. Do that.

161
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,390
<4-20,Sheldon>恶  斯图尔特
<4-20,Sheldon>Ugh. Stuart.

162
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,110
<5-1,Amy (on Skype)>谢尔顿  有啥新鲜事吗
<5-1,Amy (on Skype)>Hi, Sheldon. What's new?

163
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,650
<5-2,Sheldon>我们的朋友是混蛋  我气他们所有人
<5-2,Sheldon>Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.

164
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,010
<5-3,Amy>我是问"有啥新鲜事"  不过算了
<5-3,Amy>I said, "What's new?" but sure.

165
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,420
<5-4,Sheldon>你能相信他们打算组团去
<5-4,Sheldon>Can you believe they planned a trip

166
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,730
<5-4,Sheldon>赌城玩却不邀请我吗
<5-4,Sheldon>to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?

167
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,330
<5-5,Amy>你是不是拒绝道歉
<5-5,Amy>Did you refuse to apologize

168
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,250
<5-5,Amy>还表现得他们生气是愚蠢的表现呀
<5-5,Amy>and act like they were stupid for being mad?

169
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,620
<5-6,Sheldon>我更喜欢我们之前的感情
<5-6,Sheldon>You know, I liked it better when there was still

170
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,250
<5-6,Sheldon>留有一丝丝神秘感
<5-6,Sheldon>a little mystery left in our relationship.

171
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,860
<5-7,Amy>大家都努力去照顾你
<5-7,Amy>Everyone tried to take care of you,

172
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,060
<5-7,Amy>而你只会对他们毒舌嫌弃
<5-7,Amy>and you were nothing but mean to them.

173
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,090
<5-8,Sheldon>真不敢相信你居然不站我这边
<5-8,Sheldon>I can't believe you're not on my side.

174
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,260
<5-8,Sheldon>有人偷了你的汽车音响时  我可是站你这边
<5-8,Sheldon>I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.

175
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,450
<5-9,Amy>你不站我这边  你还能站谁那边啊
<5-9,Amy>Who else's side could you have been on?

176
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,580
<5-9,Amy>难说啊
<5-9,Amy>I don't know.

177
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,530
<5-10,Sheldon>说不定窃贼是个热爱音乐的高尚流浪汉
<5-10,Sheldon>A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?

178
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,250
<5-11,Amy>谢尔顿  我理解你不高兴
<5-11,Amy>Sheldon, I understand that you're upset

179
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,540
<5-11,Amy>因为觉得自己被孤立
<5-11,Amy>because you feel left out,

180
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,080
<5-11,Amy>但我不明白这事有啥好浪费时间讨论
<5-11,Amy>but I don't know why we're even talking about this.

181
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,100
<5-11,Amy>去跟他们道歉就对了
<5-11,Amy>Just apologize to them.

182
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,190
<5-12,Sheldon>如果要这样才能加入他们的白痴之旅  那行吧
<5-12,Sheldon>Fine, if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip.

183
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,800
<5-13,Amy>或许你可以试着
<5-13,Amy>Maybe you could try apologizing

184
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,220
<5-13,Amy>真的因为觉得内疚而道歉
<5-13,Amy>because you actually feel bad.

185
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,430
<5-13,Amy>这叫同理心
<5-13,Amy>It's called empathy.

186
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,430
<5-13,Amy>这方面你可以提升一下
<5-13,Amy>It's something you could work on.

187
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,190
<5-14,Sheldon>我有同理心啊
<5-14,Sheldon>I have empathy.

188
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,430
<5-14,Sheldon>请看
<5-14,Sheldon>Watch.

189
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,660
<5-14,Sheldon>莱纳德为我煮汤  我却嫌东嫌西
<5-14,Sheldon>Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.

190
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,420
<5-14,Sheldon>非常好
<5-14,Sheldon>Great.

191
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,200
<5-15,Amy>现在试试像个正常人一样讲话
<5-15,Amy>Now try it as if this isn't your first day as a person.

192
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,490
<5-15,Amy>行
<5-15,Amy>Fine.

193
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,690
<5-16,Sheldon>莱纳德为我煮汤  我却嫌东嫌西
<5-16,Sheldon>Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.

194
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,690
<5-16,Sheldon>哎哟  我有点感觉了
<5-16,Sheldon>Hey, I felt a little something.

195
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,340
<5-16,Sheldon>我再试试
<5-16,Sheldon>Let me try again.

196
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,710
<5-16,Sheldon>莱纳德为我煮汤  我却嫌东嫌西
<5-16,Sheldon>Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.

197
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,500
<5-16,Sheldon>我的确嫌东嫌西了
<5-16,Sheldon>I was mean to him.

198
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,780
<5-16,Sheldon>他肯定不好受
<5-16,Sheldon>He must have felt terrible.

199
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,400
<5-16,Sheldon>现在我也觉得不好受了
<5-16,Sheldon>Oh, now I feel terrible.

200
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,400
<5-16,Sheldon>真是妙啊

202
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,070
<5-18,Sheldon>现在让我看看你因为撒谎
<5-18,Sheldon>Now let me see you feel bad for lying

203
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,140
<5-18,Sheldon>故意在底特律待着不走而内疚的样子
<5-18,Sheldon>and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.

204
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,670
<5-19,Amy>我觉得非常非常内疚
<5-19,Amy>I feel so, so bad.

205
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,070
<5-20,Sheldon>看来咱俩很擅长这个嘛
<5-20,Sheldon>Hey, we're both great at this.

206
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,530
<6-1,Sheldon>莱纳德  准备接受道歉
<6-1,Sheldon>Leonard, get ready for an apology.

208
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,640
<6-1,Sheldon>而跟奈特·沙马兰拍的电影不一样的地方是
<6-1,Sheldon>And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie,

209
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,480
<6-1,Sheldon>我打算真心来做
<6-1,Sheldon>I'm going to mean it.

210
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,830
<6-2,Leonard>所以就像任何一部
<6-2,Leonard>Ah, so like every other

211
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,170
<6-2,Leonard>我看过的奈特·沙马兰电影那样
<6-2,Leonard>M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen,

212
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,250
<6-2,Leonard>你提前剧透了
<6-2,Leonard>you spoil it in advance.

213
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,030
<6-3,Sheldon>如果你没发现《第六感》的主角其实是死人
<6-3,Sheldon>Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time,

214
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,770
<6-3,Sheldon>那可不能怪我
<6-3,Sheldon>that's not on me.

215
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,060
<6-3,Sheldon>好吧

217
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,580
<6-3,Sheldon>我生病的时候  你努力照顾我
<6-3,Sheldon>You tried to take care of me when I was sick,

218
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,850
<6-3,Sheldon>而我却对你嫌东嫌西
<6-3,Sheldon>and I was mean to you.

219
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,010
<6-3,Sheldon>没有任何理由可以这样做
<6-3,Sheldon>There's no excuse for that.

220
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,310
<6-3,Sheldon>我真的很抱歉
<6-3,Sheldon>And I'm truly sorry.

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,670
<6-5,Sheldon>我想让你知道这是发自内心的
<6-5,Sheldon>I want you to know that that is sincere.

224
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,050
<6-5,Sheldon>我的确觉得内疚
<6-5,Sheldon>I-I do feel bad.

225
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,570
<6-5,Sheldon>我这么说不是为了要加入你们的旅行
<6-5,Sheldon>I'm not just saying it to be included on your trip.

226
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,550
<6-6,Leonard>那真是多谢了
<6-6,Leonard>Appreciate that, too.

227
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,250
<6-7,Sheldon>太好了
<6-7,Sheldon>Terrific.

228
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,590
<6-7,Sheldon>现在就剩你邀请我加入了
<6-7,Sheldon>Now all that's left is for you to invite me to come.

229
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,780
<6-7,Sheldon>我会问  "你确定吗"
<6-7,Sheldon>Me to ask, "Are you sure?"

<6-7,Sheldon>"看着你的小脸  我怎么忍心拒绝呢"
<6-7,Sheldon>"How could I say no to that face?"

233
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,180
<6-8,Leonard>你还是不能来
<6-8,Leonard>You're still not coming.

<6-9,Sheldon>我知道我们不经常玩这游戏
<6-9,Sheldon>I know that we don't play this game very often,

236
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,870
<6-9,Sheldon>但你玩的方式不对

<6-10,Leonard>but you upset a lot of people while you were sick.

239
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,000
<6-10,Leonard>所以你能不能来  不是我说了算

284
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,250
<9-3,Sheldon>不是因为我想加入赌城之旅
<9-3,Sheldon>This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.

285
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,610
<9-4,Stuart>什么赌城之旅
<9-4,Stuart>What trip to Las Vegas?

<9-6,Stuart>当然  没人邀请我
<9-6,Stuart>Of course, I wasn't invited.

288
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,370
<9-7,Sheldon>我是这么理解的
<9-7,Sheldon>That would be my understanding.

289
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,220

<9-7,Sheldon>你穿多大号的T恤
<9-7,Sheldon>what size T-shirt do you take?

291

<10-1,Sheldon>拉杰  你是个体贴善良的好朋友
<10-1,Sheldon>Raj, you were being a good friend,

292
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,890
<10-1,Sheldon>生病不能作为我恶劣行为的借口
<10-1,Sheldon>and my illness was no excuse for my behavior.

293
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,850
<10-1,Sheldon>我希望你能接受我的道歉
<10-1,Sheldon>I hope that you can accept my apology.

296
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,810
<10-3,Sheldon>说你们皮肤科医生不算真正的医生
<10-3,Sheldon>dermatologists aren't real doctors.

297
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,890
<10-3,Sheldon>我想这类言论你一定听腻了
<10-3,Sheldon>And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.

298
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,260
<10-4,Emily>你真心觉得我常听到别人这么说吗
<10-4,Emily>Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?

299
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,780
<10-5,Sheldon>当你的工作尽是挤痘痘
<10-5,Sheldon>Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits

300
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,990
<10-5,Sheldon>或者往老女人脸上注射肉毒杆菌时...
<10-5,Sheldon>and squirting Botox into old lady faces...

301
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,640
<10-5,Sheldon>打住
<10-5,Sheldon>Okay!

302
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,120
<10-6,Raj>够了  重点是

<10-6,Raj>that we accept your apology.

304
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,210
<10-7,Emily>也许你原谅了他
<10-7,Emily>Uh, maybe you do.

305
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,880
<10-7,Emily>但他刚才又侮辱了我一次
<10-7,Emily>He just insulted me again.

306
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,730
<10-8,Raj>但他不是故意的
<10-8,Raj>Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.

307
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,900
<10-9,Emily>你干嘛帮他说话
<10-9,Emily>Why are you defending him?

308
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,430
<10-10,Sheldon>这个问题我知道答案
<10-10,Sheldon>I believe I can answer that.

309
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,000
<10-10,Sheldon>和我一样
<10-10,Sheldon>Uh, like me,

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,850
<10-10,Sheldon>拉杰正在展示他的同理心
<10-10,Sheldon>Raj is demonstrating empathy.

311
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,250
<10-10,Sheldon>现在  你何不接受我的道歉
<10-10,Sheldon>Now, why don't you accept my apology,

312
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,110
<10-10,Sheldon>拿上你的免费T恤
<10-10,Sheldon>receive your free T-shirt, uh--

313
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,560
<10-10,Sheldon>特小号应该合适你吧
<10-10,Sheldon>I hope extra small is okay.

314
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,070
<10-10,Sheldon>不知道为啥沃罗维兹把中号拿走了
<10-10,Sheldon>For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.

315
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,050
<10-11,Emily>我不接受你的道歉
<10-11,Emily>Well, I don't accept your apology.

316
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,890
<10-12,Raj>你这是干什么呢
<10-12,Raj>What are you doing?

317
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,610
<10-13,Emily>这叫做为自己出头
<10-13,Emily>It's called standing up for myself.

318
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,390
<10-13,Emily>你偶尔也应该试试
<10-13,Emily>You should try it some time.

319
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,580
<10-14,Raj>好吧  那这样如何
<10-14,Raj>Fine, how about this?

320
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,050
<10-14,Raj>你拉长了这场无聊的争执
<10-14,Raj>You're making me uncomfortable

321
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,670
<10-14,Raj>让我很不舒服
<10-14,Raj>by prolonging this ridiculous fight,

322
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,440
<10-14,Raj>我希望你不要再闹了
<10-14,Raj>and I wish you'd stop.

323
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,930
<10-15,Emily>你希望我不要再闹了吗
<10-15,Emily>Oh, you want me to stop?

324
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,080
<10-15,Emily>没问题
<10-15,Emily>No problem.

325
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,700
<10-16,Raj>别这样  你别走啊
<10-16,Raj>No, come on, please don't leave!

326
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,400
<10-17,Sheldon>我想搞清楚  你还会去旅行吗
<10-17,Sheldon>Point of clarification-- are you still going on the trip?

327
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,040
<10-17,Sheldon>如果你不去的话...
<10-17,Sheldon>Because if not...

328
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,790
<10-18,Emily>别担心  你可以去
<10-18,Emily>Don't worry, you're good.

329
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,900
<10-19,Sheldon>是我引起了这场争吵  我觉得好内疚
<10-19,Sheldon>I caused that fight, I feel terrible.

330
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,850
<10-19,Sheldon>等等等等  我还可以演得更好...
<10-19,Sheldon>Wait, I can do that better...

331
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,930
<10-19,Sheldon>是我引起了这场争吵
<10-19,Sheldon>I caused that fight.

332
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,550
<10-19,Sheldon>人家觉得好内疚
<10-19,Sheldon>I feel terrible.

333
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,900
<10-19,Sheldon>我自己都分不清哪个演法更出色了
<10-19,Sheldon>Yeah, wow, I don't know which one I like more.

334
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,180
<11-1,Penny>他们吵得很糟糕吗
<11-1,Penny>So, was the fight really bad?

335
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,190
<11-1,Penny>不
<11-1,Penny>No.

336
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,000
<11-2,Sheldon>作为一场争吵  那真是恰到好处
<11-2,Sheldon>As a fight, it was excellent.

337
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,180
<11-2,Sheldon>她言辞激烈  摔门而去
<11-2,Sheldon>She used harsh language and slammed the door.

338
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,430
<11-2,Sheldon>虽然我也同时反应过来
<11-2,Sheldon>Although as I say this,

339
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,170
<11-2,Sheldon>你问的估计不是这个意思
<11-2,Sheldon>that might not have been what you were asking.

340
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,620
<11-3,Leonard>他们还会去旅行吗
<11-3,Leonard>You think they'll still go on the trip?

341
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,170
<11-4,Sheldon>我只知道我为了平息这场争吵去了艾米丽家...
<11-4,Sheldon>All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth...

342
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,070
<11-5,Leonard>-他们不会去了吧  -是的
<11-5,Leonard>- They're not going on the trip. - No.

343
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,500
<11-7,Raj>你这人到底什么毛病
<11-7,Raj>What is wrong with you?

344
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,200
<11-8,Sheldon>看看他  如此关心我有什么毛病
<11-8,Sheldon>Look at him, caring about what's wrong with me.

345
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,710
<11-8,Sheldon>这真是一等一的同理心啊
<11-8,Sheldon>That is some top-shelf empathy.

346
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,940
<11-8,Sheldon>我们应该组成一个俱乐部
<11-8,Sheldon>Hey, well, we should start a club.

347
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,160
<11-9,Raj>你去艾米丽家道歉
<11-9,Raj>You went to Emily's to apologize.

348
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,510
<11-9,Raj>等你走了以后  她就哭了
<11-9,Raj>And when you left, she was crying.

349
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,190
<11-10,Sheldon>这是真的
<11-10,Sheldon>That is true.

350
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,950
<11-10,Sheldon>我想我应该再道歉一次了
<11-10,Sheldon>Well, I suppose I should apologize again.

351
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,920
<11-12,Penny>她没事吧
<11-12,Penny>Is she okay?

352
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,160
<11-13,Raj>没事  我安抚了她
<11-13,Raj>Yeah, I calmed her down.

353
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,720
<11-13,Raj>但如果谢尔顿去赌城  她就不去了
<11-13,Raj>But she's not going to Vegas if he's going.

354
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,010
<11-14,Howard>等等  还有这个选项吗
<11-14,Howard>Wait, that's an option?

355
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,220
<11-14,Howard>我都不知道还有这个选项
<11-14,Howard>I didn't know that was an option.

356
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,170
<11-15,Sheldon>没关系  因为我决定
<11-15,Sheldon>Well, that is fine, because I've decided

357
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,440
<11-15,Sheldon>我不和你们去旅行了
<11-15,Sheldon>that I won't be joining you.

358
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,650
<11-15,Sheldon>因为我意识到最能表达
<11-15,Sheldon>I've realized that the most genuine way

359
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,950
<11-15,Sheldon>我的歉意的方式
<11-15,Sheldon>to demonstrate the remorse I feel is

360
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,740
<11-15,Sheldon>就是让你们自己好好享受这个周末
<11-15,Sheldon>to let you have this weekend to yourselves.

361
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,250
<11-16,Raj>你真成熟大度
<11-16,Raj>That's very mature of you.

362
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,830
<11-17,Sheldon>我自己最近也正在进行一段旅行
<11-17,Sheldon>Well, I've been on a little trip myself recently.

363
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,990
<11-17,Sheldon>不是去罪恶之都  而是去最善之城
