00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,520
<1-1,Raj>这个退休派对真不错

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,700
<1-2,Howard>是啊
<1-2,Howard>I guess.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,560
<1-2,Howard>不过还是挺可惜的
<1-2,Howard>Still, it's a shame

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,590
<1-2,Howard>罗斯曼教授是被迫退休的
<1-2,Howard>Professor Rothman was forced to step down.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,280
<1-3,Leonard>学校也没办法啊

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,160
<1-3,Leonard>他已经精神崩溃了
<1-3,Leonard>He snapped.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,000
<1-3,Leonard>理论物理学家不都这样吗
<1-3,Leonard>It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,080
<1-4,Howard>我想知道谢尔顿还有多久才崩溃
<1-4,Howard>I wonder how long Sheldon's got.

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,920
<1-5,Sheldon>这几个虾仁大小都一样
<1-5,Sheldon>These shrimp are all the same size.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,530
<1-5,Sheldon>吃的时候都找不到一个有逻辑的次序
<1-5,Sheldon>There's no the logical order to eat them in.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,040
<1-6,Leonard>没多久了
<1-6,Leonard>Can't be very long.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,970
<1-7,Raj>看啊  这是罗斯曼的办公室人去楼空
<1-7,Raj>Hey, look, there's Rothman's empty office.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,480
<1-10,Howard>-真可悲  -对啊  -超可悲的
<1-10,Howard>- Sad. Mm, indeed. - Yeah. - So sad.

<1-12,Kripke>各位好呀
<1-12,Kripke>What's up, fellas?

<1-13,Sheldon>你在这儿干嘛  克莱皮克
<1-13,Sheldon>What are you doing here, Kripke?

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,350
<1-14,Kripke>量一量我的新办公室该装多大的窗帘啊
<1-14,Kripke>Ah, measuring my new office for drapes.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,300
<1-15,Sheldon>这不是你的新办公室
<1-15,Sheldon>This is not your office.

19
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,810
<1-15,Sheldon>归谁还不一定呢
<1-15,Sheldon>It hasn't been assigned yet.

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,280
<1-16,Kripke>早在圣诞节派对上
<1-16,Kripke>Well, I called dibs at the Christmas party

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,900
<1-16,Kripke>罗斯曼教授试图跟玩具盒里的公仔做爱时
<1-16,Kripke>when Professor Rothman tried to have intercourse

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,010
<1-16,Kripke>我就说了这里归我了
<1-16,Kripke>with the Toys for Tots collection box.

23
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,920
<1-16,Kripke>归你
<1-16,Kripke>Dibs?!

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,260
<1-17,Sheldon>咱这儿可是堂堂的大学  不是游乐场
<1-17,Sheldon>This is a university, not a playground.

25
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,500
<1-17,Sheldon>办公室可不会因为
<1-17,Sheldon>Offices are not assigned

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,110
<1-17,Sheldon>谁喊归谁就归谁
<1-17,Sheldon>because someone called dibs.

27
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,930
<1-18,Leonard>你刚就喊了
<1-18,Leonard>You just called dibs.

28
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,090
<1-19,Sheldon>闭嘴
<1-19,Sheldon>Shut it.

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,770
<1-19,Sheldon>办公室的分配得根据资历来
<1-19,Sheldon>Offices are assigned by seniority.

00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,690
<4-11,Bernadette>我已经有张我和霍华德妈妈在威尼斯海滩
<4-11,Bernadette>I already have a picture of me and Howard's mom

129
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,590
<4-11,Bernadette>双双顶着满头小辫子的合影了
<4-11,Bernadette>getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach.

130
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,190
<4-11,Bernadette>我已经够遭罪了
<4-11,Bernadette>I've suffered enough.

131
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,480
<4-12,Penny>或者我可以先拿下来
<4-12,Penny>Well, I guess I could take it down

132
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,110
<4-12,Penny>等她过来时再挂上去  但这画好重
<4-12,Penny>and put it up when she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.

133
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,280
<4-13,Bernadette>可惜你不像画中的男人婆那么壮
<4-13,Bernadette>Oh, too bad you're not as strong as the dude in the painting.

134
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,840
<5-1,Raj>看看这个
<5-1,Raj>Would you look at this?

135
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,100
<5-1,Raj>我花了二十五块跟易趣上一个小孩
<5-1,Raj>I paid $25 to some kid on eBay

136
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,940
<5-1,Raj>买了这根手工制作的哈利·波特魔杖
<5-1,Raj>for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand.

137
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,730
<5-1,Raj>结果他给我寄来根树枝
<5-1,Raj>He sent me a stick.

138
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,210
<5-1,Raj>是他在自家后院捡的一根小树枝
<5-1,Raj>He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.

139
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,460
<5-2,Howard>上面有编号
<5-2,Howard>It's numbered.

140
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,950
<5-3,Raj>还是限量版的呢  太棒了
<5-3,Raj>Limited edition. Nice.

141
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,290
<5-4,Sheldon (knock on door)>应该是克莱皮克
<5-4,Sheldon (knock on door)>Oh, that'll be Kripke.

142
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,310
<5-5,Leonard>他来这干嘛
<5-5,Leonard>What's he doing here?

143
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,010
<5-6,Sheldon>我们准备像绅士一样解决办公室归谁
<5-6,Sheldon>We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen.

144
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,090
<5-6,Sheldon>要是这样还不行  我就在他的茶里下毒
<5-6,Sheldon>And if that doesn't work, I'm going to poison his tea.

145
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,930
<5-8,Sheldon>-库珀  -克莱皮克  请进
<5-8,Sheldon>- Cooper. - Kripke. Come in.

146
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,580
<5-8,Sheldon>我正在泡茶
<5-8,Sheldon>I'm making tea.

147
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,920
<5-8,Sheldon>要来一杯吗
<5-8,Sheldon>Would you like a cup?

148
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
<5-9,Kripke>我像穿着连衣裙的娘儿们吗
<5-9,Kripke>Am I wearing a summer frock?

149
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,450
<5-9,Kripke>不  哥不喝茶
<5-9,Kripke>No, I don't want tea.

150
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,430
<5-9,Kripke>我们直接谈正事吧
<5-9,Kripke>Let's get down to brass tacks.

151
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,350
<5-10,Sheldon>好吧  为了保护咱俩的友谊...
<5-10,Sheldon>Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship...

152
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,690
<5-11,Kripke>咱俩不是朋友
<5-11,Kripke>We're not friends.

153
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,960
<5-12,Sheldon>这话有点伤人  不过好吧
<5-12,Sheldon>Well, that's a little hard to hear, but all right.

154
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,120
<5-12,Sheldon>众所周知  外交的本质就是妥协
<5-12,Sheldon>As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise.

155
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
<5-12,Sheldon>以该本质为指导思想
<5-12,Sheldon>With that in mind,

156
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,920
<5-12,Sheldon>我提出如下建议
<5-12,Sheldon>I propose the following.

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,490
<5-12,Sheldon>罗斯曼的办公室归我
<5-12,Sheldon>I will take Rothman's office,

158
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,110
<5-12,Sheldon>你一边哭去吧
<5-12,Sheldon>and you will find a way to be okay with that.

159
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,760
<5-13,Kripke>不如这样  罗斯曼的办公室归我
<5-13,Kripke>How about I take Rothman's office,

160
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,690
<5-13,Kripke>而你滚一边凉快去
<5-13,Kripke>and you go suck a lemon?

161
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,880
<5-14,Sheldon>你确定不用我给你倒杯茶吗
<5-14,Sheldon>You sure I can't get you that cup of tea?

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,030
<5-15,Raj>不如你们这样
<5-15,Raj>How about you decide this

163
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,650
<5-15,Raj>用"石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克"来决定
<5-15,Raj>with Rock-Paper-Scissors Lizard-Spock?

164
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,240
<5-16,Kripke>这他妈又是什么

<6-14,Sheldon>I'm gonna need more force.

244
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,690
<6-15,Kripke>好了  库珀  你的玻璃心准备碎成渣渣吧
<6-15,Kripke>All right, Cooper, prepare to have your heart broken.

245
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,960
<6-15,Kripke>那算得分吗
<6-15,Kripke>Do I get points for that?

246
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,650
<6-16,Leonard>好了  已经四十五分钟了
<6-16,Leonard>All right, we gave it 45 minutes.

247
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,300
<6-16,Leonard>玩腻了  我们来点其他的
<6-16,Leonard>It's no longer funny. Let's try something else.

248
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,880
<6-17,Sheldon>你有什么建议
<6-17,Sheldon>What do you propose?

249
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,510
<6-18,Leonard>数到三
<6-18,Leonard>Uh, on the count of three,

250
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,420
<6-18,Leonard>你们一起用力往地上拍球
<6-18,Leonard>both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can.

251
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,090
<6-18,Leonard>谁的球弹得最高  办公室就归谁
<6-18,Leonard>The highest bounce wins the office.

252
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,090
<6-19,Kripke>你死定了  库珀
<6-19,Kripke>Oh, you are going down, Cooper.

253
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,490
<6-20,Sheldon>别这么自信  克莱皮克
<6-20,Sheldon>I don't think so, Kripke.

254
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,810
<6-20,Sheldon>我可是拍橡皮球的高手
<6-20,Sheldon>I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day.

255
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,770
<6-21,Leonard>好了  废话少说
<6-21,Leonard>All right, that's enough trash talk.

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,290
<6-21,Leonard>一  二  三
<6-21,Leonard>One, two, three.

257

<6-22,Howard>谢尔顿的弹得更高
<6-22,Howard>Sheldon was higher.

258
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,760
<6-23,Leonard>恭喜你  谢尔顿  办公室归你了
<6-23,Leonard>Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.

259
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,580
<6-24,Sheldon>谁才是真正的体育白痴
<6-24,Sheldon>Who's unsatisfactory in P.E. Now?

260
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,700
<7-1,Amy>这电影真棒
<7-1,Amy>Oh, what a great movie.

261
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,200
<7-2,Penny>真敢相信你没看过《火爆浪子》
<7-2,Penny>I cannot believe you've never seen Grease.

262
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,780
<7-3,Amy>我妈妈不让我看
<7-3,Amy>My mother didn't allow me to watch it.

263
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,040
<7-3,Amy>她担心我看了会加入黑帮
<7-3,Amy>She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.

264
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,650
<7-3,Amy>我得走了
<7-3,Amy>I've got to go.

265
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,030
<7-4,Bernadette>明天我还得早起
<7-4,Bernadette>I've got to get up early.

266
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,610
<7-4,Bernadette>我们公司在测试一种
<7-4,Bernadette>My company's testing a new steroid

267
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,340
<7-4,Bernadette>据说不会让睾丸缩水的新类固醇
<7-4,Bernadette>that supposedly doesn't shrink testicles,

268
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,780
<7-4,Bernadette>最晚上班的人要负责测量睾丸的工作
<7-4,Bernadette>and the last one there has to do the measuring.

269
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,470
<7-5,Amy>那我差不多也要走了
<7-5,Amy>I guess I should get going, too.

270
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,690
<7-5,Amy>晚安  画里的佩妮
<7-5,Amy>Good night, painting Penny.

<7-8,Bernadette>晚安  真的佩妮
<7-8,Bernadette>Good night, real Penny.

272
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,190
<7-6,Penny>晚安  真的艾米
<7-6,Penny>Good night, real Amy.

273
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,920
<7-7,Amy>你不用对画里的艾米说再见
<7-7,Amy>You don't have to say good night to painting Amy,

274
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,610
<7-7,Amy>因为她一直都在
<7-7,Amy>'cause she's never leaving.

275
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,570
<7-8,Bernadette>晚安  真的佩妮
<7-8,Bernadette>Good night, real Penny.

<7-10,Bernadette>晚安  异装癖佩妮
<7-10,Bernadette>Good night, transvestite Penny.

278
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,180
<7-11,Penny>好了  我要把你拿下来
<7-11,Penny>Okay. Let us take you off the wall.

279
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,080
<7-11,Penny>眼不见  心不烦
<7-11,Penny>Out of sight, out of mind.

280
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,410
<7-11,Penny>真的就好了
<7-11,Penny>I wish.

281
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,960
<7-12,Amy (entering)>我能借那部电影吗
<7-12,Amy (entering)>You know, can I borrow that movie?

282
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,730
<7-12,Amy (entering)>那些唱歌的小流氓真的让我春心荡漾
<7-12,Amy (entering)>Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.

283
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,440
<7-13,Penny>当然  你拿去看吧
<7-13,Penny>Sure, sure. Enjoy.

284
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,680
<7-13,Penny>我是说  看完了再还给我  或者...
<7-13,Penny>I mean, get it back to me when you can, or...

285
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,960
<7-13,Penny>实际上  送给你好了
<7-13,Penny>you know what, actually, you keep it.

286
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,350
<7-13,Penny>就当是我给你的礼物
<7-13,Penny>It's just going to be my gift to you.

287
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,590
<7-13,Penny>-谢谢  -拜
<7-13,Penny>- Thank you. - Bye.

288
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,270
<7-14,Amy>等等  那幅画呢
<7-14,Amy>Wait... Where'd the painting go?

289
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,020
<7-15,Penny>在那里
<7-15,Penny>It's right over there.

290
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,030
<7-16,Amy>为什么
<7-16,Amy>Why?

291
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,760
<7-17,Penny>我不知道  那画感觉很怪
<7-17,Penny>I have no idea. That is weird.

292
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,080
<7-18,Amy>-你讨厌它  -没有
<7-18,Amy>- You hate it. - No.

293
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,050
<7-19,Penny>没有没有  只是它太大了
<7-19,Penny>No, no. It's just, it's a little big.

294
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,110
<7-20,Amy>-我觉得自己好傻  -没有  你不傻
<7-20,Amy>- I feel like an idiot. - No, come on, you're not an idiot.

295
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,620
<7-21,Penny>帮我把它挂回去吧
<7-21,Penny>Look, just help me put it back up.

296
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,710
<7-22,Amy>为什么  好等我走了你再拿下来吗
<7-22,Amy>Why? So you can just take it down when I leave?

297
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,430
<7-23,Penny>-我不需要你可怜我  -艾米  别这样
<7-23,Penny>- I don't need your pity. - Oh, Amy, come on...

298
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,690
<7-24,Amy>真庆幸我没做成雕塑
<7-24,Amy>I'm just glad I didn't go for the sculpture.

299
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,020
<8-1,Sheldon>战利品
<8-1,Sheldon>Ah, the spoils.

300
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,190
<8-1,Sheldon>终于知道为什么胜者喜欢战利品了
<8-1,Sheldon>I see why Victors love them.

301
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,660
<8-2,Raj>我真为你高兴  谢尔顿
<8-2,Raj>I'm happy for you, Sheldon.

302
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,930
<8-2,Raj>同时我也承认  我会怀念和你共享一间办公室的日子
<8-2,Raj>But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.

303
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,160
<8-3,Sheldon>那是当然
<8-3,Sheldon>Oh, of course you are.

304
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,300
<8-3,Sheldon>随时欢迎你来看我
<8-3,Sheldon>Feel free to drop by any time.

305
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,190
<8-5,Sheldon>-谢谢  -记得先打电话哦
<8-5,Sheldon>- Thank you. - Yeah. Call first.

306
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,740
<8-6,Rothman>你好
<8-6,Rothman>Oh. Hello.

307
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,050
<8-6,Rothman>罗斯曼教授
<8-6,Rothman>Professor Rothman.

308
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,840
<8-7,Sheldon>这已经不是你的办公室了
<8-7,Sheldon>This isn't your office anymore.

309
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,250
<8-7,Sheldon>你退休了
<8-7,Sheldon>You're retired.

310
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,690
<8-8,Rothman>你应该说  "我看不见你"
<8-8,Rothman>I think the word you're looking for is... "Invisible."

311
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,170
<9-1,Penny>我来向你道歉
<9-1,Penny>I came to say I'm sorry.

312
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,250
<9-2,Amy>不用了
<9-2,Amy>Don't bother.

313
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,010
<9-3,Penny>-艾米  别这样  -我太受打击了
<9-3,Penny>- Oh, Amy, please. - I'm so humiliated.

314
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,700
<9-4,Amy>我坐在那里看《火爆浪子》的时候
<9-4,Amy>I sat there the whole time that we were watching "Grease,"

315
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,990
<9-4,Amy>-还以为你喜欢那幅画呢  -我知道
<9-4,Amy>- thinking you liked the painting. - I know.

316
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,100
<9-6,Amy>我从电影的开题
<9-6,Amy>I was a fool from "Summer Lovin'" To the very last

317
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,150
<9-6,Amy>傻到电影的结尾
<9-6,Amy>"Rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong."

318
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,640
<9-7,Penny>你说的没错  一点没错
<9-7,Penny>You're right. You're absolutely right.

319
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,840
<9-7,Penny>我应该对你说实话
<9-7,Penny>I should have been honest with you

320
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,450
<9-7,Penny>我该跟你坦白这礼实在太重了
<9-7,Penny>and told you the gift was too much.

321
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,070
<9-8,Amy>没错  太重
<9-8,Amy>Yes, too much.

322
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,380
<9-8,Amy>因为咱俩的友谊根本不对等
<9-8,Amy>Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical.

323
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,630
<9-8,Amy>显然  我喜欢你多过你喜欢我
<9-8,Amy>I clearly like you more than you like me.

324
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,500
<9-9,Penny>人与人之间的感情
<9-9,Penny>I don't think you can put a number on

325
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,940
<9-9,Penny>不能用数字来衡量
<9-9,Penny>how much one person likes another.

326
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,490
<9-10,Amy>我送了你一幅十二平方英尺的油画
<9-10,Amy>I bought you a painting that's 12 square feet in area.

327
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,770
<9-10,Amy>这就是数字
<9-10,Amy>There's a number.

328
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,590
<9-11,Penny>艾米  拜托...
<9-11,Penny>Amy, come on...

329
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,180
<9-12,Amy>你要是不喜欢用英尺作单位  我可以换成美元
<9-12,Amy>If you don't like feet, you can try dollars.

330
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,100
<9-12,Amy>这幅画花了我三千美元
<9-12,Amy>The painting set me back three grand.

331
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,590
<9-13,Penny>三千...  我的天
<9-13,Penny>Three gr... Oh, my God!

332
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,100
<9-13,Penny>艾米
<9-13,Penny>Look, look, Amy,

333
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,790
<9-13,Penny>记住  你一直都是我的朋友
<9-13,Penny>all you need to know is, you are my friend

334
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,860
<9-13,Penny>我不想失去你
<9-13,Penny>and I don't want to lose you out of my life.

335
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,030
<9-14,Amy>抱歉  现在你说话我可不敢相信
<9-14,Amy>I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble believing you right now.

336
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,250
<9-15,Penny>拿上锤子  咱们走
<9-15,Penny>Grab your hammer.

337
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,310
<9-16,Amy>没用  心已经碎成渣了
<9-16,Amy>No. Damage is done.

338
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,570
<9-17,Penny>好吧  本来我不想说的
<9-17,Penny>Okay, look, I didn't want to say this,

339
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,640
<9-17,Penny>但我把画摘下来的真正原因是...
<9-17,Penny>but the real reason I took the painting down was...

340
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,880
<9-17,Penny>伯纳黛特一看见  就嫉妒得牙痒痒
<9-17,Penny>because it made Bernadette very jealous.

341
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,280
<9-18,Amy>我的天啊
<9-18,Amy>Oh, my goodness,

342
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,680
<9-18,Amy>我怎么就没注意到呢
<9-18,Amy>how could I have not seen that?

343
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,440
<9-18,Amy>这幅画简直就是
<9-18,Amy>The painting is

344
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,520
<9-18,Amy>在不停地提醒她  咱们三人中
<9-18,Amy>a constant reminder that of the three of us,

345
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,420
<9-18,Amy>就她最逊
<9-18,Amy>she is the least cool.

346
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,480
<9-19,Penny>对  没...没错...所以...
<9-19,Penny>Yeah, that's... that's what it is, so...

347
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,120
<9-20,Amy>你真是太善良了
<9-20,Amy>You have such a good heart.

348
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,680
<9-21,Penny>是啊...我尽力而为
<9-21,Penny>Yeah... I try.

349
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,160
<9-22,Amy>走
<9-22,Amy>Come on.

350
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,880
<9-23,Penny>咱们要去哪儿
<9-23,Penny>Whoa, whoa, where are we going?

351
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,510
<9-24,Amy>去把这幅画挂回你家墙上
<9-24,Amy>We're going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.

352
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,540
<9-25,Penny>-那伯纳黛特怎么办  -管她呢
<9-25,Penny>- Well, what about Bernadette? - Oh, screw her.

353
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,480
<9-26,Amy>带她玩就算给她天大的面子了
<9-26,Amy>She's just lucky we let her hang out with us.

354
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,410
<10-1,Leonard>你在干嘛
<10-1,Leonard>What are you doing?

355
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,570
<10-2,Sheldon>我在努力提升这屋的温度
<10-2,Sheldon>I'm trying to raise the temperature in here

356
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,660
<10-2,Sheldon>太凉了  我激凸得都要扎破衬衫了
<10-2,Sheldon>before my nipples tear through my shirt.

357
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,030
<10-3,Howard>把空调调高点不就行了
<10-3,Howard>Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?

358
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,400
<10-4,Sheldon>问得好
<10-4,Sheldon>Aha! Good question.

359
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,930
<10-4,Sheldon>我发现我新办公室的空调开关
<10-4,Sheldon>It turns out the thermostat for my new office

360
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,320
<10-4,Sheldon>不在这个屋  对  在隔壁屋
<10-4,Sheldon>isn't in my new office. No. It's next door,

361
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,300
<10-4,Sheldon>达文波特教授的办公室里
<10-4,Sheldon>in Professor Davenport's office,

362
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,120
<10-4,Sheldon>而她正经受着更年期一波又一波的潮热
<10-4,Sheldon>who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.

363
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,150
<10-5,Leonard>这里怎么有个洞
<10-5,Leonard>Why is there a hole here?

364
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,250
<10-5,Leonard>我新办公室为什么会有个洞呢
<10-5,Leonard>Why is there a hole in my new office?

365
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,440
<10-6,Sheldon>我排除到只剩2种可能性
<10-6,Sheldon>I've narrowed it down to two possibilities:

366
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,340
<10-6,Sheldon>一种可能是墙里有什么东西
<10-6,Sheldon>"There was something in the wall

367
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,540
<10-6,Sheldon>而墙外有人想得到
<10-6,Sheldon>that someone outside the wall wanted,"

368
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,090
<10-6,Sheldon>另一种更让人心烦
<10-6,Sheldon>or the more disturbing,

369
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,100
<10-6,Sheldon>就是墙里有什么东西想出来
<10-6,Sheldon>"There was something in the wall that wanted out."

370
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,740
<10-7,Raj>好吧  至少你终于有可以打开的窗户了
<10-7,Raj>Well, at least you finally got a window that opens.

371
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,420
<10-7,Raj>多好啊
<10-7,Raj>That's nice.

372
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,540
<10-8,Sheldon>是吗  请听
<10-8,Sheldon>Is it? Listen.

373
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,610
<10-9,Raj>怎么了  难道你不喜欢风铃吗
<10-9,Raj>What, you don't like wind chimes?

374
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,520
<10-10,Sheldon>不喜欢  讨厌死了  而且还有更糟的呢
<10-10,Sheldon>No, I hate them, but it gets worse.

375
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,880
<10-11,Howard>-听到了吧  -你是说鸟叫吗
<10-11,Howard>- There it is. - The bird?

376
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,740
<10-12,Sheldon>跟风铃声完全不搭
<10-12,Sheldon>It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes.

377
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,460
<10-13,Raj>那又如何
<10-13,Raj>So?

378
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,640
<10-14,Sheldon>你还没明白吗
<10-14,Sheldon>You don't get it, do you?

379
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,770
<10-14,Sheldon>窗外那是只知更鸟
<10-14,Sheldon>That's a mockingbird.

380
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,940
<10-14,Sheldon>这种鸟啼声婉转曲调多变
<10-14,Sheldon>Mockingbirds can change their song,

381
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,420
<10-14,Sheldon>也就是说它唱跑调是故意的
<10-14,Sheldon>which means he's out of tune on purpose.

382
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,830
<10-14,Sheldon>它故意气我
<10-14,Sheldon>He's mocking me.

383
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,670
<10-14,Sheldon>天啊  又来了  你们感觉到了吗
<10-14,Sheldon>Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?

384
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,050
<10-15,Howard>渐渐感觉到你是个
<10-15,Howard>The growing realization

385
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,930
<10-15,Howard>性格古怪的王八蛋吗  我们感觉到了
<10-15,Howard>that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.

386
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,600
<10-16,Sheldon>才不是呢  我是说这个振动
<10-16,Sheldon>No. The vibration.

387
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,940
<10-16,Sheldon>这办公室正好在地质实验室下面
<10-16,Sheldon>We are directly underneath the geology lab,

388
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,320
<10-16,Sheldon>他们又开了那个讨厌的振动筛
<10-16,Sheldon>and they're running their confounded sieve shakers again.

389
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,430
<10-16,Sheldon>喂  你们这些石猴子
<10-16,Sheldon>Hey, gravel monkeys,

390
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,390
<10-16,Sheldon>想筛石头  直接用自己脑袋摇着筛吧
<10-16,Sheldon>if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!

391
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,760
<10-17,Leonard>谢尔顿  淡定
<10-17,Leonard>Sheldon, relax.

392
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,070
<10-18,Sheldon>你让我怎么淡定
<10-18,Sheldon>How can I relax?

393
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,000
<10-18,Sheldon>我的神经系统紧绷得就像竖琴弦
<10-18,Sheldon>My nervous system is being stretched out

394
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,690
<10-18,Sheldon>被这些事不停拨弄  墙洞  小鸟
<10-18,Sheldon>like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds

395
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,170
<10-18,Sheldon>风声  还有那个总亮出他下垂的蛋蛋
<10-18,Sheldon>and wind and the low-hanging scrotum

396
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,390
<10-18,Sheldon>整天阴魂不散的罗斯曼教授
<10-18,Sheldon>of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.

397
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,110
<10-19,Leonard>你要是这么不开心
<10-19,Leonard>If you're not happy,

398
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,260
<10-19,Leonard>干嘛不把办公室给克莱皮克
<10-19,Leonard>why don't you just let Kripke have the office?

399
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,470
<10-20,Sheldon>难不成把革命成果拱手相让
<10-20,Sheldon>Wait, and let him win?

400
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,280
<10-20,Sheldon>你觉得我疯了吗
<10-20,Sheldon>Do I look crazy to you?

401
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,040
<10-20,Sheldon>我们楼下还要思考呢
<10-20,Sheldon>We're trying to think down here,

402
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,640
<10-20,Sheldon>你们这帮研究石头的技工
<10-20,Sheldon>you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!

403
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,180
<10-20,Sheldon>还有你...
<10-20,Sheldon>And you...

404
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,700
<10-20,Sheldon>C调  D调  E调  G调  还有A调
<10-20,Sheldon>the notes are C, D, E, G and A.

405
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,570
<10-20,Sheldon>挑一个好好唱  不然我就砍了你的树
<10-20,Sheldon>You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!

406
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,650
<11-1,Penny>怎么样
<11-1,Penny>How's that?

407
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,230
<11-2,Amy>右边再高点
<11-2,Amy>Little higher on the right.

408
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,070
<11-4,Amy>-行吗  -再高点
<11-4,Amy>- Now? - Little more.

409
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,470
<11-4,Amy>别动了  就这样
<11-4,Amy>No. That's got it.

410
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,940
<11-5,Penny>对  好  挺...挺好
<11-5,Penny>Yeah, okay. That's, uh, that's good.

411
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,310
<11-6,Amy>告诉你个小秘密
<11-6,Amy>I'll let you in on a little secret.

412
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,800
<11-8,Amy>一开始画的咱俩是裸体的
<11-8,Amy>Originally we were painted nude.

413
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,850
<11-8,Amy>但是我让画家填上衣服了
<11-8,Amy>But I had him add clothes, 'cause I thought

414
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,490
<11-8,Amy>我觉得没必要发掘咱们的同性恋潜质
<11-8,Amy>it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.

415
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,920
<11-9,Penny>没错  改得好
<11-9,Penny>Yeah, good call.

416
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,630
<11-10,Amy>不过  你要是改主意了
<11-10,Amy>But if you ever change your mind, all it would take

417
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,510
<11-10,Amy>只需来点温肥皂水和几块海绵[共浴]
<11-10,Amy>is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.

418
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,970
<11-11,Penny>-你是说洗掉画上的衣服吗  -当然
<11-11,Penny>- You're talking about the painting, right? - Sure.

419
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,230
<12-1,Sheldon>救命  来人救命啊
<12-1,Sheldon>Help! Somebody help!

420
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,910
<12-2,Leonard>这是怎么回事
<12-2,Leonard>What happened?

421
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,470
<12-3,Sheldon>我想看看洞里有什么  结果脑袋卡住了
<12-3,Sheldon>I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.

422
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,840
<12-4,Leonard>你为什么非要看啊
<12-4,Leonard>Why would you do that?

423
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,570
<12-5,Sheldon>这叫对科学的探索精神
<12-5,Sheldon>It's called scientific curiosity!

424
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,190
<12-5,Sheldon>快去给我弄点黄油
<12-5,Sheldon>Now go get butter.

425
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,380
<12-6,Leonard>挺住
<12-6,Leonard>Hang in there.

426
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,990
<12-6,Leonard>我马上回来
<12-6,Leonard>I'll be right back.
