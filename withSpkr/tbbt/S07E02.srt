1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,310
<1-1,Sheldon>还有一个有趣的天气现象
<1-1,Sheldon>And here's another interesting weather fact.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,470
<1-2,Penny>还有吗  太好了
<1-2,Penny>Another? Great!

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,440
<1-3,Sheldon>急流的改变可以影响
<1-3,Sheldon>Changes in jet streams can affect the speed

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,750
<1-3,Sheldon>地球自转的速度
<1-3,Sheldon>at which the Earth rotates on its axis,

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,570
<1-3,Sheldon>所以坏天气能让一天时间变得长一些
<1-3,Sheldon>so bad weather can actually make the day longer.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,780
<1-4,Penny>那我现在一定是处于是雷电交加处
<1-4,Penny>Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,930
<1-5,Sheldon>随便你笑
<1-5,Sheldon>Joke if you must,

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,030
<1-5,Sheldon>不过你之后会想念现在的时光的
<1-5,Sheldon>but you're going to miss these moments.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,820
<1-5,Sheldon>莱纳德几天后就回来了
<1-5,Sheldon>With Leonard home in a few days,

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,810
<1-5,Sheldon>这是你最后一次开车送我去食品店
<1-5,Sheldon>this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,030
<1-6,Penny>是呀  我一定会"很"想念的
<1-6,Penny>You know, I will miss this.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,020
<1-7,Sheldon>这样说吧  如果我买的苹果不够脆
<1-7,Sheldon>I'll tell you what, if my apples are mealy,

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,950
<1-7,Sheldon>我们就再杀去农产品区  来次最后的疯狂抢购
<1-7,Sheldon>we'll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,060
<1-7,Sheldon>好啦  这次购物车给你推
<1-7,Sheldon>Heck, you can even push the cart.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,290
<1-7,Sheldon>请别把我期盼莱纳德归来
<1-7,Sheldon>Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard's return

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,950
<1-7,Sheldon>当作是批评你这段时间  顶替他的工作表现
<1-7,Sheldon>as criticism of the job you've been doing in his absence.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,620
<1-8,Penny>我不会的
<1-8,Penny>I won't.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,250
<1-9,Sheldon>稍后送上的成绩单里会有批评的详细内容
<1-9,Sheldon>That criticism will come later in your report card.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,670
<1-10,Penny>总之  你罚我留堂我不会理
<1-10,Penny>Yeah, I didn't stay for the detention,

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,760
<1-10,Penny>我也不会看成绩单
<1-10,Penny>I'm not gonna read the report card.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,000
<1-11,Leonard (in Penny’s apartment)>你好
<1-11,Leonard (in Penny’s apartment)>Hello.

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,650
<1-11,Leonard (in Penny’s apartment)>莱纳德
<1-11,Leonard (in Penny’s apartment)>Leonard!

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,500
<1-12,Penny (screams)>-嘘  -你回来啦
<1-12,Penny (screams)>- Shh, shh. - Hi!

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,940
<1-13,Leonard>-小声点  -我的天
<1-13,Leonard>- Keep your voice down. - Oh, my God.

25
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,370
<1-14,Penny>你不是说周日才回来吗
<1-14,Penny>You weren't supposed to be here till Sunday!

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,520
<1-15,Leonard>实验提前结束了
<1-15,Leonard>We finished the experiment early,

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,250
<1-15,Leonard>我就想着回家给你一个惊喜
<1-15,Leonard>so I thought I'd come home and surprise you.

28
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,700
<1-16,Penny>我的天  我们为什么要这样小声说话
<1-16,Penny>Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,800
<1-17,Leonard>我没有告诉谢尔顿
<1-17,Leonard>I didn't tell Sheldon,

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,360
<1-17,Leonard>这样我们可以过几天二人世界
<1-17,Leonard>so we could have a few days alone.

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,460
<1-18,Penny>真是太浪漫了
<1-18,Penny>Oh, that is so romantic.

32
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,920
<1-19,Leonard>当然  这正是我这么做的"理由"
<1-19,Leonard>Uh, sure, that's why I did it.

33
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,570
<1-20,Penny>真不敢相信你回来了
<1-20,Penny>Oh... I just cannot believe you're here.

34
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,260
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>佩妮  今天是你的幸运日
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>Penny, it's your lucky day!

35
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,950
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>有三个鸡蛋很明显不是特大号的
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo.

36
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,840
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>拿上车钥匙
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>Grab your keys.

38
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,370
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>人人影视
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>YYeTs.com

45
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,290
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>生活大爆炸
<1-21,Sheldon (off)>第七季  第二集

46
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,180
<2-1,Sheldon>斯图尔特  请问
<2-1,Sheldon>Uh, Stuart, I was wondering

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,650
<2-1,Sheldon>-你能不能帮我找点东西  -非常乐意
<2-1,Sheldon>- if you could help me find something. - Happy to,

48
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,230
<2-2,Stuart>除了帮你找希望  和活下去的理由
<2-2,Stuart>unless it's hope or a reason to live.

49
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,310
<2-3,Sheldon>你都让我笑了  悲伤的小丑
<2-3,Sheldon>Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown.

50
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,060
<2-3,Sheldon>总之
<2-3,Sheldon>Anyhoo...

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,310
<2-3,Sheldon>莱纳德几天后就回来了
<2-3,Sheldon>Leonard will be back in a couple days

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,690
<2-3,Sheldon>我要为他准备一份欢迎回家的礼物
<2-3,Sheldon>and I need a welcome-home gift for him.

53
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,140
<2-3,Sheldon>因为他一直在海上  有可能
<2-3,Sheldon>As he's been at sea, perhaps something

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,210
<2-3,Sheldon>航海主题的比较合适
<2-3,Sheldon>with a nautical theme might be appropriate.

55
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,520
<2-4,Stuart>好吧  我不知道你想花多少钱
<2-4,Stuart>Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend,

56
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,330
<2-4,Stuart>但我有个相当酷的潜水侠塑像
<2-4,Stuart>but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,360
<2-5,Sheldon>潜水侠
<2-5,Sheldon>Aquaman?

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,580
<2-5,Sheldon>我不是要送恶作剧礼物  斯图尔特
<2-5,Sheldon>Oh, this isn't a gag gift, Stuart.

59
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,320
<2-6,Stuart>没关系
<2-6,Stuart>Yeah, just as well.

60
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,310
<2-6,Stuart>这是相当珍贵的版本
<2-6,Stuart>It's a pretty rare piece.

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,950
<2-6,Stuart>我宁愿卖给真正的收藏家
<2-6,Stuart>I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.

62
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,880
<2-7,Sheldon>我就是真正的收藏家
<2-7,Sheldon>I'm a real collector.

63
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,930
<2-7,Sheldon>这个有多珍贵
<2-7,Sheldon>How rare is it?

64
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,550
<2-8,Stuart>提起这个是我不好
<2-8,Stuart>Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it.

65
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,840
<2-8,Stuart>来个蝙蝠侠水枪怎么样
<2-8,Stuart>How about a Batman squirt gun?

66
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,160
<2-9,Sheldon>别想糊弄我买
<2-9,Sheldon>Don't try and trick me

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,930
<2-9,Sheldon>我根本不想买的东西
<2-9,Sheldon>into buying something I don't want.

68
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,180
<2-9,Sheldon>给我说说潜水侠
<2-9,Sheldon>Now let's talk Aquaman.

69
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,220
<2-10,Howard>他们在想什么呀  将章鱼博士的大脑
<2-10,Howard>What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus's mind

70
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,290
<2-10,Howard>放在蜘蛛侠的身体里
<2-10,Howard>in Spider-Man's body?

71
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,220
<2-11,Raj>我还挺喜欢的
<2-11,Raj>Well, I've been quite enjoying that.

72
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,540
<2-11,Raj>这样结合了《蜘蛛侠》的超级英雄乐趣
<2-11,Raj>It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man

73
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,760
<2-11,Raj>与《辣妈辣妹》的身体互换的恶搞
<2-11,Raj>with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday.

75
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,500
<2-12,Howard>两个版本  都是原创加林赛·罗韩
<2-12,Howard>"Both versions: original and Lohan."

76
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,900
<2-12,Howard>两个版本  都是原创加林赛·罗韩
<2-12,Howard>"Both versions: original and Lohan."

77
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,720
<2-12,Howard>你真是个白痴
<2-12,Howard>You're an idiot.

78
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,190
<2-13,Raj>你这是怎么啦
<2-13,Raj>Hey, what's your problem?

79
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,200
<2-14,Howard>对不起  最近我有些暴躁
<2-14,Howard>I'm sorry, I've been kind of snippy lately.

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
<2-14,Howard>可能因为我在减肥
<2-14,Howard>It's probably this stupid diet I'm on.

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,960
<2-15,Raj>你为什么要减肥
<2-15,Raj>Why are you on a diet?

82
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
<2-16,Howard>我胖了几磅
<2-16,Howard>I've put on a couple pounds.

83
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,540
<2-16,Howard>都得到成年男装区买裤子了
<2-16,Howard>Had to buy these pants in the men's section.

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
<2-17,Raj>我们都见过你的母亲大人
<2-17,Raj>Well, we've all seen your mom.

85
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,350
<2-17,Raj>不是一家胖人
<2-17,Raj>That Butterball turkey

86
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,700
<2-17,Raj>不进一家肥门
<2-17,Raj>was bound to come home to roost.

87
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,890
<2-18,Sheldon>一千二百块  不能再加了
<2-18,Sheldon>$1,200! That's my final offer!

88
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,050
<2-19,Stuart>好吧  谢尔顿  你赢了
<2-19,Stuart>All right, Sheldon, you win.

89
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,940
<2-19,Stuart>我相信莱纳德一定会喜欢的
<2-19,Stuart>I'm sure Leonard is gonna love this.

90
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,040
<2-20,Sheldon>对了  还要给莱纳德买礼物呢
<2-20,Sheldon>Oh, right, a present for Leonard.

91
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,240
<2-20,Sheldon>给我加上那把水枪吧
<2-20,Sheldon>You better throw in that squirt gun.

92
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,820
<2-21,Stuart>你真要买吗
<2-21,Stuart>Yeah, I don't know.

93
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,280
<2-21,Stuart>这把水枪  相当的  相当的珍贵
<2-21,Stuart>This squirt gun, it's, uh, it's pretty rare.

94
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,570
<3-1,Leonard>这是我在船上做《泰坦尼克号》的招牌动作
<3-1,Leonard>And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.

95
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:12,940
<3-3,Leonard>还有
<3-3,Leonard>And... oh.

96
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,450
<3-3,Leonard>这是我掉下船后被救起来
<3-3,Leonard>That's me getting rescued after I fell in.

97
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,840
<3-4,Penny>-披萨来了  -好的
<3-4,Penny>- Oh, that's the pizza. - Yep.

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,000
<3-7,Leonard>咱这些被海风吹的老练的水手
<3-7,Leonard>That's what us salty sea dogs say

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
<3-7,Leonard>要去尿尿时都这么说
<3-7,Leonard>when we have to go pee-pee.

<3-10,Penny>不是吧
<3-10,Penny>Seriously?

105
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,960
<3-11,Pizza guy>我刚爬了四层楼梯哦
<3-11,Pizza guy>I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.

<3-12,Penny>30-something cents

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
<3-12,Penny>加上我向你保证不会打电话给你老板
<3-12,Penny>and a promise I won't call your boss

110
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,740
<3-12,Penny>揭发你一身大麻的臭味
<3-12,Penny>and tell him you reek of marijuana.

<3-13,Sheldon>佩妮  你点了披萨
<3-13,Sheldon>Oh, Penny, I see you've ordered pizza.

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,060
<3-15,Sheldon>你的古龙水味好有大地的气息啊
<3-15,Sheldon>Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne.

115
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,750
<3-15,Sheldon>我叔叔以前就喷这种
<3-15,Sheldon>My uncle used to wear that.

116
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,370
<3-15,Sheldon>趁莱纳德还没有回来
<3-15,Sheldon>Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together

117
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,540
<3-15,Sheldon>-也许我们可以共进最后一次晚餐  -多谢了
<3-15,Sheldon>- before Leonard returns. - Yeah, thanks,

118
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,170
<3-16,Penny>但我今晚想一个人吃饭  算了吧
<3-16,Penny>but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so...

119
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,160
<3-16,Penny>你确定吗
<3-16,Penny>Are you sure?

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,890
<3-17,Sheldon>你有意大利披萨  我有中式面条
<3-17,Sheldon>With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles,

121
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,000
<3-17,Sheldon>我们可以玩马可波罗
<3-17,Sheldon>we could play Marco Polo.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,560
<3-17,Sheldon>当然了  是吃饭时
<3-17,Sheldon>I mean, of course, a reenactment of a meal

123
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,110
<3-17,Sheldon>玩威尼斯探险家马可波罗的角色扮演
<3-17,Sheldon>in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer,

124
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,680
<3-17,Sheldon>不是吓死人的马可波罗水上游戏
<3-17,Sheldon>not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.

125
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,680
<3-17,Sheldon>类似鬼抓人游戏  鬼得闭上眼睛  喊着"马克"
<3-17,Sheldon>其他人就得喊"波罗"  听音辨位

126
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
<3-18,Penny>听起来很有意思  不过多谢了
<3-18,Penny>Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.

127
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,200
<3-18,Penny>晚安啦
<3-18,Penny>Have a good night!

128
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,970
<3-19,Sheldon>你家有客人吗
<3-19,Sheldon>What, now... do you have company?

129
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,400
<3-20,Penny>没有  当然没有
<3-20,Penny>No. No, no, no.

130
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,100
<3-20,Penny>知道吗  马桶一直在抽风
<3-20,Penny>You know what? Th-The toilet's been doing that.

131
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,320
<3-20,Penny>我已经打电话给大厦管理员了
<3-20,Penny>I called the building manager, so...

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,830
<3-21,Sheldon>我可以帮你看看
<3-21,Sheldon>Oh, I can take a look at it.

133
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,150
<3-23,Sheldon>我对水管工的工作还挺在行的
<3-23,Sheldon>I'm quite familiar with plumbing.

134
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,520
<3-23,Sheldon>不是吹牛哈
<3-23,Sheldon>Not to brag,

135
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,270
<3-23,Sheldon>我读五年级时  大部分时候头是被摁在马桶里的
<3-23,Sheldon>but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.

136
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,880
<3-24,Penny>不用了
<3-24,Penny>dort dort dort Yeah, no, no, no.

137
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,560
<3-24,Penny>谢尔顿  没关系
<3-24,Penny>You know what, Sheldon, it's okay.

138
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,250
<3-24,Penny>你不用去厕所
<3-24,Penny>You don't have to go into the bathroom.

139
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,850
<3-25,Sheldon>好奇怪
<3-25,Sheldon>That's curious.

140
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,440
<3-25,Sheldon>如果家里就你一个人
<3-25,Sheldon>If there's no one here,

141
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,730
<3-25,Sheldon>为什么桌上有两杯红酒
<3-25,Sheldon>why are there two glasses of wine on the table?

142
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,970
<3-25,Sheldon>这个啊
<3-25,Sheldon>Oh.

143
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,870
<3-26,Penny>我有两只手
<3-26,Penny>Well, you know, I-I've got two hands

144
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,970
<3-26,Penny>而且有轻微酗酒的问题
<3-26,Penny>and a bit of a drinking problem.

145
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,850
<3-27,Sheldon>当然了
<3-27,Sheldon>Of course.

146
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,870
<3-27,Sheldon>我问这种问题真傻
<3-27,Sheldon>Ask a silly question.

147
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,330
<3-29,Sheldon>好奇怪
<3-29,Sheldon>That's odd.

148
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,200
<3-30,Penny>又怎么啦
<3-30,Penny>Um, what?

149
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,190
<3-31,Sheldon>垃圾桶里有外带饭盒
<3-31,Sheldon>There are takeout containers in the trash can.

150
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,410
<3-32,Penny>有什么奇怪的  那是我昨晚的晚餐
<3-32,Penny>So? That's my dinner from last night.

151
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,660
<3-33,Sheldon>奇怪的是你居然把饭盒扔进垃圾桶里
<3-33,Sheldon>What's odd is they're in the trash can.

152
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,510
<3-33,Sheldon>好吧
<3-33,Sheldon>Okay.

153
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,940
<3-34,Penny>亲爱的  我保证这里没其他人
<3-34,Penny>Look, honey, I promise there's no one's here.

154
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,820
<3-34,Penny>我今天好累
<3-34,Penny>I've had a long day.

155
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,080
<3-34,Penny>我只想一个人安静地吃顿晚餐
<3-34,Penny>I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.

156
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,010
<3-35,Sheldon>好吧
<3-35,Sheldon>Oh, very well.

157
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,120
<3-35,Sheldon>反正我早就习惯于享受独处的乐趣
<3-35,Sheldon>I'm no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude.

158
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,080
<3-36,Penny>-对了  -什么事
<3-36,Penny>- Oh! - What?

159
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,830
<3-37,Sheldon>你为莱纳德准备了欢迎回家的礼物吗
<3-37,Sheldon>Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?

160
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,940
<3-39,Sheldon>-没有  -太好了
<3-39,Sheldon>- No. - Oh, great.

161
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,240
<3-39,Sheldon>我买了把两百块的水枪  你想跟我合送吗
<3-39,Sheldon>Do you want to go halfsies on a $200 squirt gun?

162
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,500
<4-1,Bernadette>亲爱的
<4-1,Bernadette>Hi, honey.

163
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,910
<4-3,Bernadette>我做了巧克力蛋糕  你想吃吗
<4-3,Bernadette>I made some brownies. You want one?

164
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,610
<4-4,Howard>你在开玩笑  对吗
<4-4,Howard>You're kidding, right?

165
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,670
<4-4,Howard>你应该知道
<4-4,Howard>I mean, you know

166
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,680
<4-4,Howard>我在减肥吧
<4-4,Howard>I'm trying to lose weight.

167
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,180
<4-4,Howard>老天  我还以为我们夫妻心有灵犀呢
<4-4,Howard>God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.

168
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,950
<4-5,Bernadette>我们是的  别这样
<4-5,Bernadette>We are. Stop it.

169
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,820
<4-5,Bernadette>我最后说一次  你不胖
<4-5,Bernadette>And for the last time, you're not fat.

170
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,800
<4-6,Howard>是吗  这话跟浴室秤说去
<4-6,Howard>Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale,

171
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,890
<4-6,Howard>你和它之间有一个在说谎
<4-6,Howard>'cause one of you is lying.

172
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,150
<4-7,Bernadette>好吧  当我没问
<4-7,Bernadette>Fine, forget I asked.

173
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,730
<4-7,Bernadette>在你妈妈家吃晚餐还好吗
<4-7,Bernadette>How was dinner at your mom's?

174
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,530
<4-8,Howard>太可怕了
<4-8,Howard>Awful.

175
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,400
<4-8,Howard>又得帮她全身擦药膏
<4-8,Howard>I had to rub her ointment all over her again.

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,790
<4-9,Bernadette>她为什么不自己擦
<4-9,Bernadette>Why can't she do it?

177
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,270
<4-10,Howard>因为我们母子的关系相当不健康
<4-10,Howard>'Cause we've got a deeply unhealthy relationship.

178
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,650
<4-10,Howard>这倒提醒我了
<4-10,Howard>Which reminds me,

179
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,010
<4-10,Howard>你可以趁工作之便拿这个的样品吗
<4-10,Howard>do you think you can get any samples of this from work?

180
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,440
<4-10,Howard>这个本来要用一个月的
<4-10,Howard>This was supposed to last her a month,

181
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,510
<4-10,Howard>但是医生没有考虑到
<4-10,Howard>but they didn't take into account

182
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,770
<4-10,Howard>她背部的庞大的面积
<4-10,Howard>the square footage of her back.

183
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,860
<4-10,Howard>我看看
<4-10,Howard>Let me see.

184
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,280
<4-11,Bernadette>你帮她擦这个多久了
<4-11,Bernadette>How long have you been putting this on her?

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,040
<4-11,Bernadette>不知道
<4-11,Bernadette>I don't know.

186
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,560
<4-12,Howard>几个星期吧  怎么啦
<4-12,Howard>Few weeks. Why?

187
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,820
<4-13,Bernadette>这是药效相当强的雌性激素药膏
<4-13,Bernadette>This is really strong estrogen cream.

188
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,740
<4-13,Bernadette>拜托你告诉我你戴了手套
<4-13,Bernadette>Please tell me you've been wearing gloves.

189
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,590
<4-14,Howard>肿得像香肠一样的手指戴得下手套吗
<4-14,Howard>Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,820
<4-15,Bernadette>华仔  雌性激素经由你的皮肤吸收了
<4-15,Bernadette>Howie, the estrogen's getting absorbed by your skin.

191
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,790
<4-15,Bernadette>所以你最近才这么的
<4-15,Bernadette>That's why you've been

192
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,530
<4-15,Bernadette>喜怒无常  顶心顶肺
<4-15,Bernadette>all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.

193
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,960
<4-16,Howard>你全身都是雌性激素  你怎么不这样
<4-16,Howard>You're full of estrogen and you don't act like that.

194
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,160
<4-17,Bernadette>因为我是女人啊
<4-17,Bernadette>That's 'cause I'm a woman.

195
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,480
<4-17,Bernadette>我练习了多年来驾驭魔性
<4-17,Bernadette>I've had years of practice riding the dragon.

196
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,150
<4-17,Bernadette>好吧
<4-17,Bernadette>Fine.

197
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,380
<4-18,Howard>下次我会戴手套的
<4-18,Howard>I'll wear gloves next time.

198
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,560
<4-19,Bernadette>这些激素要想排出体外
<4-19,Bernadette>It's still gonna take a few weeks

199
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,890
<4-19,Bernadette>还是需要几周的时间
<4-19,Bernadette>for the hormones to leave your system.

200
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,630
<4-20,Howard>我觉得自己好蠢
<4-20,Howard>I feel so stupid.

201
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,400
<4-20,Howard>好肥
<4-20,Howard>And fat.

202
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,610
<4-20,Howard>没关系
<4-20,Howard>It's okay.

203
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,600
<4-21,Bernadette>我还是觉得你好帅
<4-21,Bernadette>You still look great to me.

204
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,570
<4-21,Bernadette>不如我们去卧室
<4-21,Bernadette>In fact, why don't we go in the bedroom

205
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,370
<4-21,Bernadette>我向你证明吧
<4-21,Bernadette>and I'll prove it to you?

206
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,020
<4-22,Howard>上床  你不是吧
<4-22,Howard>Sex? Really?

207
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,710
<4-22,Howard>这就是你解决一切问题的方法
<4-22,Howard>I mean, that's just your solution to everything!

208
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,150
<5-1,Amy>有趣的是
<5-1,Amy>Oh, and here's a fun thing.

209
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,320
<5-1,Amy>我想到了办法  所以
<5-1,Amy>I worked it out so that there are

210
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,370
<5-1,Amy>表示勺子有两个词
<5-1,Amy>two different words for spoon:

211
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,770
<5-1,Amy>"凹里满"和"凹里空"
<5-1,Amy>"Planko" and "Janko."

212
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,870
<5-1,Amy>"凹里满"是舀了食物的勺子
<5-1,Amy>"Planko" is a spoon with food,

213
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,600
<5-1,Amy>"凹里空"是没舀食物的勺子
<5-1,Amy>"Janko" is a spoon without food.

214
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,490
<5-1,Amy>"凹里空"里的"空"要发儿话音
<5-1,Amy>"Janko" is spelled with a silent "Ptang."

215
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,420
<5-1,Amy>谢尔顿  你根本没仔细听
<5-1,Amy>Sheldon, you're not even listening

216
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,590
<5-1,Amy>我原创语言的规则
<5-1,Amy>to the rules of my made-up language.

217
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,790
<5-2,Sheldon>我有听啊
<5-2,Sheldon>Yes, I am.

218
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,780
<5-3,Amy>那么"扇扇风"是什么
<5-3,Amy>Then what does "tweepadock" mean?

219
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,340
<5-4,Sheldon>大象
<5-4,Sheldon>Elephant?

220
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,070
<5-5,Amy>算你运气好
<5-5,Amy>Lucky guess.

221
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,490
<5-5,Amy>对不起
<5-5,Amy>I'm sorry.

222
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,060
<5-6,Sheldon>佩妮家的事让我烦心意乱
<5-6,Sheldon>I'm just distracted by something that happened over at Penny's.

223
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,220
<5-7,Amy>出什么事了
<5-7,Amy>What happened?

224
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,130
<5-8,Sheldon>我害怕佩妮对莱纳德不忠
<5-8,Sheldon>I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.

225
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,160
<5-9,Amy>什么
<5-9,Amy>What?

226
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,900
<5-10,Sheldon>她说她是一个人
<5-10,Sheldon>She claimed to be alone

227
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,080
<5-10,Sheldon>但明明她家就还有其他的人
<5-10,Sheldon>when there was obviously someone else in her apartment.

228
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,720
<5-10,Sheldon>我往最坏的地方想也是没办法的事
<5-10,Sheldon>I have no choice but to assume the worst,

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,790
<5-10,Sheldon>考虑到莱纳德远航在外
<5-10,Sheldon>given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage

230
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,290
<5-10,Sheldon>还有她那声名在外的渴望被甘霖滋润的旱地
<5-10,Sheldon>and her famously ravenous nether regions.

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,180
<5-11,Amy>我觉得佩妮不会对莱纳德不忠的
<5-11,Amy>I don't think Penny would cheat on Leonard.

232
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,810
<5-12,Sheldon>是吗
<5-12,Sheldon>Oh, really?

233
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,410
<5-12,Sheldon>有一次我和她玩瞪眼比赛
<5-12,Sheldon>She and I once had a staring contest.

234
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,240
<5-12,Sheldon>她大声鼓掌让我眨眼
<5-12,Sheldon>She clapped really loud and made me blink.

235
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,120
<5-12,Sheldon>从这点到出轨只有一小步之遥
<5-12,Sheldon>It's a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.

236
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,260
<5-13,Amy>你这是在强词夺理
<5-13,Amy>You're being ridiculous.

237
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,120
<5-14,Sheldon>艾米  她居然会把中餐外带饭盒
<5-14,Sheldon>Amy, there were Chinese food containers...

238
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,940
<5-14,Sheldon>丢到垃圾桶里
<5-14,Sheldon>in the trash can.

239
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
<5-15,Amy>可怜的莱纳德
<5-15,Amy>Poor Leonard.

240
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,640
<6-1,Amy>你听到什么了吗
<6-1,Amy>Do you hear anything?

241
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,080
<6-2,Sheldon>我听到女人的声音
<6-2,Sheldon>I hear a woman's voice.

242
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,040
<6-3,Amy>是佩妮吗
<6-3,Amy>Is it Penny?

243
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,790
<6-3,Amy>不  是你
<6-3,Amy>No, it's you.

244
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,080
<6-4,Sheldon>好吧  我听到低语轻笑
<6-4,Sheldon>All right, I hear whispering and giggling.

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,660
<6-4,Sheldon>现在我想我听到接吻声了
<6-4,Sheldon>Now I think I hear kissing.

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,330
<6-5,Amy>说得好像你知道接吻声是什么样似的
<6-5,Amy>Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.

247
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,870
<6-6,Sheldon>《星际迷航》里有亲嘴  聪明鬼
<6-6,Sheldon>There's kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.

<6-7,Amy>Let me listen.

249
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,920
<6-7,Amy>声音像是莱纳德

250
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,990
<6-7,Amy>瞎说
<6-7,Amy>Please.

251
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,240
<6-8,Sheldon>为啥莱纳德提前回家
<6-8,Sheldon>Why would Leonard come home early

252
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,050
<6-8,Sheldon>却浪费时间和佩妮亲嘴
<6-8,Sheldon>and waste his time kissing Penny

253
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,840
<6-8,Sheldon>而不和他最好的朋友一起玩呢
<6-8,Sheldon>when he could be hanging out with his best buddy?

254
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,050
<6-8,Sheldon>行了  够了

259
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,290
<6-12,Sheldon>莱纳德
<6-12,Sheldon>Leonard?

260
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,660
<6-13,Penny>谢尔顿  你不能这样直接闯进来
<6-13,Penny>Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that!

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,250
<6-13,Penny>好吧

<6-14,Sheldon>Are you going to answer the door

265
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,540
<6-14,Sheldon>还是我自己开门  再说一次"抓到啦"
<6-14,Sheldon>or should I open it and say "Aha" again?

266
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,070
<7-1,Leonard>抱歉  谢尔顿
<7-1,Leonard>I'm sorry, Sheldon.

267
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,140
<7-1,Leonard>我应该告诉你我回来了
<7-1,Leonard>I should've told you I was back.

268

<7-1,Leonard>我只是想和佩妮单独相处几天
<7-1,Leonard>I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.

269
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,330
<7-2,Sheldon>不  应该是我道歉
<7-2,Sheldon>Oh, no, I should apologize.

270
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,180
<7-2,Sheldon>我从未意识到我们的友谊
<7-2,Sheldon>Uh, I never realized to what extent

271
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,320
<7-2,Sheldon>对你而言是一种负担
<7-2,Sheldon>our friendship was a burden to you.

272
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,040
<7-3,Leonard>你这么说就过分了
<7-3,Leonard>That is not fair.

273
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,440
<7-3,Leonard>我每月至少抱怨一次这个负担何其沉重啊
<7-3,Leonard>I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.

274
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,160
<7-4,Sheldon>行了行了  别绕弯子了
<7-4,Sheldon>Oh, no, no, let's not sugarcoat this.

275
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,870
<7-4,Sheldon>你就是觉得我挑剔  迂腐  讨厌嘛
<7-4,Sheldon>You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.

<7-6,Leonard>我之前确实说过这些词
<7-6,Leonard>I actually have used those exact words before.

278
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,480
<7-6,Leonard>连顺序都一样

<7-7,Sheldon>莱纳德  现在是时候
<7-7,Sheldon>Well, Leonard, I think it's high time

284
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,470
<7-10,Amy>好吧

<7-11,Sheldon>Leonard,

286
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,600
<7-11,Sheldon>你不必
<7-11,Sheldon>there's no need for you

287
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,210
<7-11,Sheldon>再假装喜欢我了
<7-11,Sheldon>to pretend to like me anymore.

288
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,730
<7-12,Leonard>别这样  我道歉了
<7-12,Leonard>Come on, I said I was sorry.

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,320
<7-13,Sheldon>不用了  你把你的道歉
<7-13,Sheldon>No, no, you save your apologies

290
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,840
<7-13,Sheldon>留着和佩妮交媾不满意的时候用吧
<7-13,Sheldon>for after you've had disappointing coitus with Penny.

291
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,080
<7-14,Penny>也没很差啦
<7-14,Penny>It was fine.

292
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,090
<7-15,Leonard>别这样  这太傻了
<7-15,Leonard>Come on, this is silly.

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,370
<7-16,Sheldon>就能赎回我们的友谊吗
<7-16,Sheldon>with a cheap souvenir?

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,710
<9-6,Sheldon>没准你会把我丢在荒芜的游乐园里
<9-6,Sheldon>I'll end up in a deserted amusement park.

369
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,010
<9-6,Sheldon>或是某个玉米田迷宫
<9-6,Sheldon>Or a cornfield maze.

370
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,540
<9-6,Sheldon>或是某个后巷斗狗场
<9-6,Sheldon>Or a back alley dog fight.

371
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,110
<9-6,Sheldon>你说吧
<9-6,Sheldon>You tell me.

372
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,720
<9-7,Leonard>我去上班了
<9-7,Leonard>I'm going to work.

373
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,860
<9-7,Leonard>愿意你就跟我走
<9-7,Leonard>You can come if you want.

374
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,670
<9-7,Leonard>好吧
<9-7,Leonard>Okay.

375
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,360
<9-8,Sheldon>我说  你衣服上沾了脏东西
<9-8,Sheldon>By the way, you have something on your shirt.

376
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,830
<9-9,Leonard>没有啊
<9-9,Leonard>No, I don't.

377
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,650
<9-10,Sheldon>被人骗好伤心  对不对
<9-10,Sheldon>Hurts, doesn't it?

378
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,300
<9-10,Sheldon>我真是忍不住要怀疑
<9-10,Sheldon>You know, I find myself wondering

379
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,810
<9-10,Sheldon>你以前是不是一直在骗我
<9-10,Sheldon>if anything you've ever told me is true.

380
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,450
<9-11,Leonard>我还是没能挽回局面
<9-11,Leonard>I didn't make it back.

381
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,660
<9-11,Leonard>事态严重  我是在劫难逃了
<9-11,Leonard>The ship sank, I'm in hell.

382
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,300
<9-12,Sheldon>你说自己来自新泽西  我可不敢相信你
<9-12,Sheldon>You say you're from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?

383
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,560
<9-13,Leonard>世界上怎么会有人冒充
<9-13,Leonard>Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey

384
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,850
<9-13,Leonard>自己是新泽西人呢
<9-13,Leonard>if they weren't?

385
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,470
<9-14,Sheldon>好吧  你说得有道理
<9-14,Sheldon>All right, I'll give you that one.

386
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,800
<9-15,Leonard>我都道过歉了
<9-15,Leonard>Hey, I said I was sorry.

387
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,430
<9-15,Leonard>你还想要我怎么样啊
<9-15,Leonard>What else do you want from me?

388
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,610
<9-16,Sheldon>-我要你承认自己错了  -行
<9-16,Sheldon>- I want you to admit that what you did was wrong. - Fine.

389
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,230
<9-17,Leonard>我真的错了
<9-17,Leonard>What I did was wrong.

390
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,330
<9-18,Sheldon>信你才怪
<9-18,Sheldon>I wish I could believe you.

391
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,700
<9-18,Sheldon>算了吧
<9-18,Sheldon>You know what?

392
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,970
<9-19,Leonard>我不载你去上班了
<9-19,Leonard>I'm not driving you to work,

393
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,610
<9-19,Leonard>你实在是烦死人
<9-19,Leonard>because you're incredibly annoying.

394
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,100
<9-20,Sheldon>你这人心口不一
<9-20,Sheldon>You say one thing and do the other,

395
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,930
<9-20,Sheldon>所以你不但要载我上班  还挺喜欢我的
<9-20,Sheldon>so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.

396
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,390
<9-22,Sheldon>-别说了  -继续吗
<9-22,Sheldon>- Stop it. - Keep it up?

397
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,050
<9-23,Leonard>-再见  -你好
<9-23,Leonard>- Bye! - Hello!

398
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,180
<9-24,Sheldon>你其实是想竖其他四根指头对吧
<9-24,Sheldon>So I guess you're really holding up the other four fingers?

399
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,740
<10-1,Penny>你这么早过来干什么
<10-1,Penny>Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?

400
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,870
<10-2,Amy>送谢尔顿上班
<10-2,Amy>Driving Sheldon to work.

401
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,960
<10-3,Penny>他还在生莱纳德的气吗
<10-3,Penny>He's still mad at Leonard, huh?

402
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,330
<10-4,Amy>他也在生你的气
<10-4,Amy>Well, he's mad at you, too.

403
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,260
<10-4,Amy>他说你是让他朋友堕落的魅魔
<10-4,Amy>He says you're the succubus who led his friend astray.

405
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,790
<10-5,Penny>我不知道魅魔是什么  不过
<10-5,Penny>I don't know what "Succubus" is, but...

406
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,750
<10-5,Penny>里面有魔[烂]字  肯定不是好词
<10-5,Penny>it has "suck" in it, so that can't be good.

407
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,540
<10-6,Sheldon>我就觉得听到你的声音了
<10-6,Sheldon>Thought I heard you out here.

408
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,800
<10-7,Penny>你好呀  谢尔顿
<10-7,Penny>Hey, Sheldon.

409
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,260
<10-8,Sheldon>你不配我说"你好"
<10-8,Sheldon>You don't get a "hey."

410
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,160
<10-8,Sheldon>你只配得到"嗯"
<10-8,Sheldon>You get a "hmm."

411
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,700
<10-9,Penny>拜托  不要这么绝情
<10-9,Penny>Come on, don't be like that.

412
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,040
<10-9,Penny>我们前几个月不是一直玩得挺好的嘛
<10-9,Penny>We had so much fun together the last couple of months.

413
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,030
<10-9,Penny>你说得对
<10-9,Penny>You're right.

414
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,320
<10-10,Sheldon>所以你的背叛才显得更加不可饶恕
<10-10,Sheldon>Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.

415
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,910
<10-11,Penny>谢尔顿
<10-11,Penny>Sheldon...

416
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,260
<10-12,Sheldon>我都把自己的超市会员卡
<10-12,Sheldon>I let you buy feminine hygiene products

417
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,740
<10-12,Sheldon>借给你去买女性生理用品了
<10-12,Sheldon>with my supermarket club card.

418
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,060
<10-12,Sheldon>你知道现在他们都寄给我
<10-12,Sheldon>You have any idea the kind of coupons

419
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,170
<10-12,Sheldon>什么产品的折扣券吗
<10-12,Sheldon>I'm going to get in the mail now?

420
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,910
<10-13,Amy>谢尔顿  你是和莱纳德斗气
<10-13,Amy>Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard.

421
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,880
<10-13,Amy>佩妮和这事没有关...
<10-13,Amy>Penny's got nothing to do...

422
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,930
<10-14,Sheldon>你也要小心了  艾米
<10-14,Sheldon>Careful, Amy.

423
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,110
<10-14,Sheldon>我的敌人的女友的朋友  也是我的敌人哦
<10-14,Sheldon>The friend of my enemy's girlfriend is my enemy.

424
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,320
<10-15,Amy>-真的吗  -是的
<10-15,Amy>- Really? - Yes.

425
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,850
<10-16,Sheldon>你要不就顺着我  要不就逆着我
<10-16,Sheldon>You're either with me or against me.

426
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,960
<10-17,Amy>我看你是打算坐公车上班了
<10-17,Amy>You want to take the bus to work?

427
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,180
<10-18,Sheldon>也许还存在第三种选择
<10-18,Sheldon>Maybe there's a third option.

428
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,820
<10-19,Amy>对了  我早餐吃的就是甜甜圈  混球
<10-19,Amy>FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.

429
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,170
<11-1,Leonard>现在我们还在等
<11-1,Leonard>So now we're just waiting for the data

430
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,660
<11-1,Leonard>船上的资料处理完毕
<11-1,Leonard>from the ship to be crunched,

431
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,190
<11-1,Leonard>但从数据上看  结果应该不差
<11-1,Leonard>but the numbers look pretty promising.

432
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,240
<11-2,Howard>太厉害了
<11-2,Howard>That's so great.

433
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,160
<11-2,Howard>如果你们能证明盎鲁效应的存在
<11-2,Howard>If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation...

434
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,910
<11-2,Howard>喂  喂  这位仁兄
<11-2,Howard>Hey, hey, hey, hey!

435
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,480
<11-2,Howard>看我的眼  别乱看
<11-2,Howard>My eyes are up here.

436
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,250
<11-3,Sheldon>霍华德  拉杰
<11-3,Sheldon>Howard, Raj.

437
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,060
<11-3,Sheldon>犹大[背叛者]
<11-3,Sheldon>Judas.

438
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,880
<11-4,Leonard>懒得理你
<11-4,Leonard>You know what?

439
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,510
<11-4,Leonard>你就是个疯子
<11-4,Leonard>You're a crazy person.

440
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,670
<11-5,Sheldon>一个拥有好记性的疯子
<11-5,Sheldon>A crazy person with a long memory,

441
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,870
<11-5,Sheldon>如果一切进行顺利  还有一支机器人军团
<11-5,Sheldon>and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.

442
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,650
<11-6,Howard>别说了
<11-6,Howard>Stop it.

443
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,020
<11-7,Sheldon>或者是变异军团
<11-7,Sheldon>Or a mutant army.

444
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,390
<11-7,Sheldon>就看我写在圆梦网上的计划有没有人投资了
<11-7,Sheldon>It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.

445
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,510
<11-7,Sheldon>我说你们别闹了
<11-7,Sheldon>I said, stop it!

446
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,850
<11-8,Howard>听我说
<11-8,Howard>Now, listen to me.

447
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,130
<11-8,Howard>你们俩不光是普通朋友
<11-8,Howard>You two aren't just friends.

448
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,810
<11-8,Howard>你们可是好朋友
<11-8,Howard>You're best friends.

449
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,200
<11-8,Howard>友情是多么美好的事啊
<11-8,Howard>And that's a beautiful thing.

450
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,840
<11-8,Howard>莱纳德  你知道他为什么特别生气吗
<11-8,Howard>I mean, Leonard, you know why he's so mad at you?

451
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,360
<11-8,Howard>那是因为他想念你呀
<11-8,Howard>It's 'cause he missed you!

452
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,560
<11-8,Howard>而你作为他的好友
<11-8,Howard>Yeah, and as his friend,

453
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,700
<11-8,Howard>你应该高兴才对
<11-8,Howard>you should be happy

454
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,200
<11-8,Howard>他找到了生命中的真爱
<11-8,Howard>he has love in his life.

455
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,150
<11-8,Howard>就像我一样
<11-8,Howard>As I do.

456
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,490
<11-8,Howard>这位帅哥那天摸了我的胸部
<11-8,Howard>This man held my breast the other day,

457
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,310
<11-8,Howard>我为此深深敬爱他
<11-8,Howard>and I love him for it.

458
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,380
<11-9,Raj>你不如再吼大声点  老兄
<11-9,Raj>A little loud, dude.

459
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,320
<11-10,Howard>所以  我们能不能忽略这些小矛盾
<11-10,Howard>So, can we please put aside these petty differences

460
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,530
<11-10,Howard>为了我们的团聚开心一点
<11-10,Howard>and just be glad we're here together?

461
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,100
<11-12,Sheldon>-好吧  -我同意
<11-12,Sheldon>- Okay. - I suppose so.

462
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,040
<11-13,Howard>谢谢
<11-13,Howard>Thank you.

463
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,330
<11-14,Raj>我们没做什么怪事
<11-14,Raj>Uh, it wasn't anything weird.

464
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,060
<11-14,Raj>我是为了测量他的胸部有多大而已
<11-14,Raj>It was just to see how big they were.

465
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,020
<12-1,Sheldon>后来莱纳德带我去了理发店和牙医诊所
<12-1,Sheldon>And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist,

466
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,770
<12-1,Sheldon>以及为完美的一天划下终点的
<12-1,Sheldon>and then to cap off the perfect day,

467
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,270
<12-1,Sheldon>洛杉矶计量局
<12-1,Sheldon>the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.

468
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,850
<12-2,Leonard>我原以为尺寸测量最受欢迎
<12-2,Leonard>I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show;

469
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,640
<12-2,Leonard>没想到重量测量更胜一筹
<12-2,Leonard>turns out it was the weights.

470
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,860
<12-3,Penny>你们和好了  我真开心
<12-3,Penny>I'm so glad you guys are friends again.

471
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,650
<12-4,Sheldon>我俩和好了   我也很开心
<12-4,Sheldon>And I'm glad you and I are friends again, too.

472
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,160
<12-6,Sheldon>我想起来了
<12-6,Sheldon>Aw. Which reminds me.

473
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,120
<12-6,Sheldon>这是随信寄来的  我想送给你
<12-6,Sheldon>This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.

474
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,020
<12-7,Penny>女性阴部洗剂  凭券折价5毛
<12-7,Penny>"50 cents off Vagisil."

475
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,450
<12-8,Sheldon>使用的时候可别忘了我
<12-8,Sheldon>Think of me when you apply it.

476
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,680
<12-9,Raj>我想对你们说
<12-9,Raj>Uh, can I just say,

477
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,710
<12-9,Raj>我真心怀念大家伙聚在一起的时光
<12-9,Raj>I've missed all of us hanging out together.

478
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,220
<12-11,Penny>-没错  -我也是
<12-11,Penny>- Yeah. - Me, too.

479
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,900
<12-12,Leonard>库斯拉帕从什么时候开始
<12-12,Leonard>Um, since when can Koothrappali talk

480
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,780
<12-12,Leonard>不用喝酒也可以在女生面前讲话啦
<12-12,Leonard>in front of the girls without a beer?

481
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,770
<12-13,Bernadette>你刚走他就痊愈了
<12-13,Bernadette>Oh, that happened right after you left.

482
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,730
<12-14,Leonard>怎么没人告诉我
<12-14,Leonard>And no one told me?

483
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,840
<12-15,Howard (crying)>我们居然忘记告诉他了
<12-15,Howard (crying)>Can't believe we forgot to tell him.

484
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,140
<12-16,Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon)>使用的时候别忘了谢尔顿
<12-16,Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon)>Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
