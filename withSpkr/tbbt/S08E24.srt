1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,140
<1-1,Amy>你敢相信我们已经交往五年了吗
<1-1,Amy>Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,730
<1-1,Amy>是啊
<1-1,Amy>I know.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,040
<1-2,Sheldon>你觉得我该开始看电视剧《闪电侠》了吗
<1-2,Sheldon>Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,310
<1-3,Amy>你脑子里就在想这个啊
<1-3,Amy>That's what you're thinking about?

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,490
<1-4,Sheldon>这只是其中一件
<1-4,Sheldon>Well, one of the things.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,310
<1-5,Amy>有跟我有关的事吗
<1-5,Amy>Are any of them me?

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,030
<1-5,Amy>有啊
<1-5,Amy>Yes.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,310
<1-6,Sheldon>我在想  "不知道该不该开始看《闪电侠》电视剧
<1-6,Sheldon>I thought, "I can't decide if I should watch The Flash TV show.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,970
<1-6,Sheldon>对了  我可以问问艾米"
<1-6,Sheldon>I know, I'll ask Amy."

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,770
<1-6,Sheldon>言归正传
<1-6,Sheldon>Anyway...

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,160
<1-7,Amy>你在干嘛
<1-7,Amy>What are you doing?

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,170
<1-8,Sheldon>也是  气氛都被你毁了
<1-8,Sheldon>You're right, you did kind of kill the mood.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,180
<1-9,Amy>才不是我呢
<1-9,Amy>I didn't kill anything.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,350
<1-9,Amy>是你  在那边说你的白痴电视剧
<1-9,Amy>You did, talking about your stupid TV show.

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,770
<1-10,Sheldon>你说什么
<1-10,Sheldon>Excuse me.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,690
<1-10,Sheldon>跳坑看一部可能播好几年的电视剧
<1-10,Sheldon>Starting to watch a television show that might run for years

17
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,750
<1-10,Sheldon>不是随便就能决定的好吗
<1-10,Sheldon>isn't a decision to take lightly.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,880
<1-10,Sheldon>我在纠结要不要许下这一重大承诺呢
<1-10,Sheldon>I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,440
<1-10,Sheldon>真的吗
<1-10,Sheldon>Really?

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,240
<1-11,Amy>你纠结的承诺问题就是这种事吗
<1-11,Amy>That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with?

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,280
<1-11,Amy>谢尔顿
<1-11,Amy>Sheldon,

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,760
<1-11,Amy>你能理解这有多讽刺吗
<1-11,Amy>do you understand the irony

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,390
<1-11,Amy>你能对一个拥有超高速的男人这么痴迷
<1-11,Amy>of your fixation on a man with super speed,

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,890
<1-11,Amy>而我在跟了你五年后却只能得到
<1-11,Amy>while after five years all I can get out of you

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,030
<1-11,Amy>在沙发上的一场你心不在焉的亲热
<1-11,Amy>is a distracted make-out session on a couch?

26
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,090
<1-12,Sheldon>讽刺不是我的强项
<1-12,Sheldon>Irony's not really my strong suit.

27
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,420
<1-12,Sheldon>不过我对挖苦的理解有不小进步
<1-12,Sheldon>But I have been getting better with sarcasm,

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,400
<1-12,Sheldon>你可以试试看啊
<1-12,Sheldon>if you want to give that a try.

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,490
<1-13,Amy>行啊  我"当然愿意"啦
<1-13,Amy>Oh, sure, I'd love to.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,920
<1-14,Sheldon>你准备好了就出招吧
<1-14,Sheldon>Whenever you're ready.

37
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,160
<2-1,Stuart>我不想催你们
<2-1,Stuart>I don't want to rush you,

38
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,120
<2-1,Stuart>但我今晚要提早关门
<2-1,Stuart>but I'm closing a little early tonight.

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,010
<2-2,Raj>有约会吗
<2-2,Raj>Ooh. Hot date?

40
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,280
<2-3,Stuart>没  我听到伯纳黛特跟霍华德说
<2-3,Stuart>Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,410
<2-3,Stuart>要给他做肉卷
<2-3,Stuart>she was making him a meat loaf,

42
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,080
<2-3,Stuart>我不想麻烦人家"不邀请我"两次
<2-3,Stuart>and you don't have to not ask me twice.

43
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,470
<2-4,Emily>如果我在上面加个灯泡
<2-4,Emily>If I stick a lightbulb on this,

44
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,210
<2-4,Emily>是不是超适合当我卧室的台灯
<2-4,Emily>wouldn't it make a great lamp for my bedroom?

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,420
<2-5,Raj>你是在开玩笑的  对吧
<2-5,Raj>You're kidding, right?

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,840
<2-6,Emily>这吓到你了吗
<2-6,Emily>Oh. Is this freaking you out?

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,730
<2-7,Raj>没  我只是比较喜欢那些
<2-7,Raj>I guess I'm just more of a Pottery Barn,

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,340
<2-7,Raj>连锁家具用品店的产品而已
<2-7,Raj>Crate and Barrel kind of guy.

49
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,660
<2-7,Raj>想疯狂时  我会选进口手工家具店
<2-7,Raj>Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.

50
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,790
<2-8,Emily>好吧  那算了
<2-8,Emily>All right. Never mind.

51
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,840
<2-9,Raj>别别别  你想买就买吧
<2-9,Raj>No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it.

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,340
<2-9,Raj>来  员外给你买
<2-9,Raj>In fact, I'll buy it for you.

53
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,790
<2-10,Stuart>卖
<2-10,Stuart>Sold!

54
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,760
<2-11,Emily>拉杰  你不需要这样
<2-11,Emily>Raj, you don't have to do that.

55
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,030
<2-12,Stuart>晚了  一经售出  概不退还
<2-12,Stuart>Too late! No returns!

56
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,120
<3-1,Leonard>刚才真是生死一瞬间啊
<3-1,Leonard>That was really intense.

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,890
<3-2,Penny>现在我们知道了  下次去农贸市场
<3-2,Penny>Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market,

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,840
<3-2,Penny>应该是先去亲近动物区  再去买蔬菜
<3-2,Penny>the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.

59
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,730
<3-4,Sheldon>太好了  你回来了  我有事要你帮忙
<3-4,Sheldon>Oh, good. You're here. I need your assistance.

60
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,990
<3-5,Leonard>我能先给被羊的地方贴上创口贴吗
<3-5,Leonard>Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,430
<3-6,Sheldon>怎么回事
<3-6,Sheldon>What happened?

62
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,010
<3-7,Penny>你兄弟被家畜幼崽给打劫啦
<3-7,Penny>Your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.

63
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,300
<3-8,Sheldon>我也试过
<3-8,Sheldon>Been there.

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,420
<3-9,Penny>你有什么事需要帮忙呀
<3-9,Penny>So what do you need help with?

65
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,400
<3-10,Sheldon>艾米在生我气  我搞不懂是为什么
<3-10,Sheldon>Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,640
<3-11,Penny>好吧  她生气前你是不是在说话
<3-11,Penny>Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?

67
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,240
<3-13,Penny>-是啊  -这就是原因啦
<3-13,Penny>- Yes. - That's probably it.

68
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,600
<3-13,Penny>你跟她说什么了
<3-13,Penny>What'd you say to her?

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,460
<3-14,Sheldon>我就问她我该不该开始看
<3-14,Sheldon>Well, I just asked her if I should start watching

70
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,280
<3-14,Sheldon>新电视剧《闪电侠》
<3-14,Sheldon>the new Flash TV series.

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,680
<3-15,Penny>这把她惹生气了吗
<3-15,Penny>And that made her angry?

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,100
<3-16,Sheldon>很莫名其妙  对吧
<3-16,Sheldon>Baffling, right?

73
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,150
<3-16,Sheldon>本来我们还像小流氓们一样
<3-16,Sheldon>We were necking like a couple of hooligans

74
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,470
<3-16,Sheldon>在学校里亲亲我我
<3-16,Sheldon>under the school bleachers.

75
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,950
<3-16,Sheldon>然后我停下来问了她这问题
<3-16,Sheldon>I stopped so I could ask the question.

76
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,950
<3-16,Sheldon>接下来  亲亲脸没了  凶凶脸来了
<3-16,Sheldon>Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.

77
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,410
<3-17,Penny>谢尔顿  你在亲女生的时候
<3-17,Penny>Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl,

78
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,560
<3-17,Penny>她会希望你的注意力在她身上
<3-17,Penny>she expects the attention to be on her.

79
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,120
<3-18,Sheldon>有啊  我有问她
<3-18,Sheldon>It was. I asked her

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,000
<3-18,Sheldon>"她"觉得我该不该看《闪电侠》
<3-18,Sheldon>if she thought I should watch The Flash.

81
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,640
<3-19,Penny>要求换人  莱纳德你上
<3-19,Penny>Yeah. I'm tapping out. Leonard?

82
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,640
<3-20,Leonard>我猜你主要的疑虑是对于看一整季新剧
<3-20,Leonard>I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment

83
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,860
<3-20,Leonard>需要做出的时间承诺
<3-20,Leonard>of watching an entire season of a new show.

84
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,460
<3-21,Sheldon>不  不只是一季
<3-21,Sheldon>Oh, no, not just a season.

85
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,520
<3-21,Sheldon>要看  就得看到底
<3-21,Sheldon>If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run,

86
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,180
<3-21,Sheldon>哪怕剧质量越来越差
<3-21,Sheldon>even if the quality declines.

87
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,710
<3-22,Leonard>我懂  《超人前传》把你伤得太深了
<3-22,Leonard>I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.

88
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,480
<3-23,Sheldon>没错
<3-23,Sheldon>Exactly.

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,910
<3-23,Sheldon>我等了整整十年
<3-23,Sheldon>You know, I waited ten years

90
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,120
<3-23,Sheldon>才看到一个大家都知道会飞的人  飞起来
<3-23,Sheldon>to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.

91
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,990
<3-24,Penny>等等  你俩是哪里有病啊
<3-24,Penny>Wait, what is wrong with you two?

92
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,200
<3-24,Penny>重点是他在约会之夜聊电视剧
<3-24,Penny>He was talking about television during their date night.

93
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,290
<3-25,Sheldon>可不只是约会之夜  是五周年纪念日哦
<3-25,Sheldon>Oh, not just date night-- our fifth anniversary.

94
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,370
<3-26,Penny>你看  这句话就比你在想
<3-26,Penny>Okay, see, that's even dumber than you wondering

95
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,140
<3-26,Penny>被羊咬会不会得到羊的力量还要蠢
<3-26,Penny>if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.

96
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,260
<3-27,Sheldon>如果成真了  拜托别让我等了十年
<3-27,Sheldon>If that happens, don't make me wait ten years

97
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,920
<3-27,Sheldon>才让我看到你吃掉锡罐
<3-27,Sheldon>to watch you eat a tin can.

98
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,880
<4-1,Raj>你们有发现艾米丽有一点黑暗扭曲吗
<4-1,Raj>You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?

99
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,640
<4-2,Bernadette>你是指因为她有怪怪的刺青吗
<4-2,Bernadette>You mean 'cause she has weird tattoos?

100
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,670
<4-3,Raj>不  是因为她想跟我在墓地里做爱
<4-3,Raj>No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.

101
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,270
<4-4,Howard>再说一次
<4-4,Howard>One more time?

102
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,690
<4-5,Raj>她本来今晚要跟我
<4-5,Raj>She and I were supposed to watch

103
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,880
<4-5,Raj>去看新《复仇者联盟》电影  但票卖完了
<4-5,Raj>the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out.

104
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,400
<4-5,Raj>我就说"那我们应该干嘛"
<4-5,Raj>So I said, "What else do you want to do?"

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,970
<4-5,Raj>她说"我们就去墓场
<4-5,Raj>She said, "Let's go to a cemetery

106
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,740
<4-5,Raj>在别人的坟上打一炮吧
<4-5,Raj>and do it on somebody's grave."

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,740
<4-6,Howard>是陌生人还是认识的人的坟头上啊
<4-6,Howard>Like, a random person or somebody she knew?

108
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,250
<4-7,Raj>这有差别吗
<4-7,Raj>What difference does it make?

109
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,830
<4-8,Howard>如果是在她爸的坟上搞  而他们以前关系不好
<4-8,Howard>Well, if it's her father's grave and they didn't get along,

110
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,170
<4-8,Howard>那你就知道她一直心怀怨恨
<4-8,Howard>then you know she holds a grudge.

111
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,990
<4-9,Bernadette>唯一的问题是每个人都有自己的性怪癖
<4-9,Bernadette>The only issue is that everybody has their own thing.

112
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,800
<4-9,Bernadette>但只要两个成年人都同意这么做
<4-9,Bernadette>And as long as it's two consenting adults,

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,520
<4-9,Bernadette>我不觉得有什么危害呀
<4-9,Bernadette>I guess I don't see the harm in it.

114
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,830
<4-10,Raj>万一只是一个成年人同意
<4-10,Raj>Well, what if it's one consenting adult

115
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,490
<4-10,Raj>而另一个成年人是假装同意
<4-10,Raj>and one adult who pretends to consent

116
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,200
<4-10,Raj>因为他太害怕当单身狗了  这怎么破
<4-10,Raj>because he's afraid of being alone?

117
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,760
<4-11,Bernadette>那我建议最好带上一张毯子
<4-11,Bernadette>Well, then I guess bring a blanket.

118
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,040
<4-11,Bernadette>夜里的草地很潮湿
<4-11,Bernadette>The grass gets damp at night.

119
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,230
<4-12,Raj>我不知道了
<4-12,Raj>I don't know, guys.

120
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,550
<4-12,Raj>或许这段恋情并不适合我
<4-12,Raj>Maybe this relationship isn't for me.

121
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,230
<4-12,Raj>或许我该跟她分手
<4-12,Raj>Maybe I should break up with her.

122
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,620
<4-13,Howard>是啊  你要跟一个愿意跟你上床的女人分手
<4-13,Howard>Right. You're gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you.

123
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,370
<4-13,Howard>你听听这家伙说啥蠢话
<4-13,Howard>Can you believe this guy?

124
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,040
<4-14,Bernadette>如果拉杰想跟女人分手  我相信他必能做到
<4-14,Bernadette>I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,160
<4-15,Howard>你怎么做到一脸正经地鬼扯呢
<4-15,Howard>How are you saying that with a straight face?

126
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,120
<4-16,Bernadette>我也不知道
<4-16,Bernadette>I don't know.

127
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,870
<4-17,Raj>你们俩真过分
<4-17,Raj>You guys are being jerks.

128
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,080
<4-18,Howard>伙计  除了珍妮·克莱格减肥法
<4-18,Howard>Buddy, other than Jenny Craig,

130
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,610
<4-18,Howard>你这辈子从未甩过一个女人
<4-18,Howard>you've never broken up with a girl in your life.

131
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,610
<4-18,Howard>你还好意思说我
<4-18,Howard>You're one to talk.

132
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,090
<4-19,Raj>你不也一直在抱怨斯尔图特
<4-19,Raj>You've been complaining about Stuart

133
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,170
<4-19,Raj>在你家住了一年死活不走吗
<4-19,Raj>living here for the past year.

134
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,540
<4-19,Raj>我看你也没有赶他走的意思啊
<4-19,Raj>I don't see you showing him the door.

135
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,350
<4-20,Howard>那不一样
<4-20,Howard>That's not the same thing.

136
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,720
<4-20,Howard>艾米丽是一个人
<4-20,Howard>Emily's a person.

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,750
<4-20,Howard>斯尔图特更像一只害虫
<4-20,Howard>Stuart's more like an infestation,

138
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,840
<4-20,Howard>就是欠杀虫剂喷的那种
<4-20,Howard>something you spray for.

139
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,430
<4-21,Raj>胡扯  你们俩跟我一样
<4-21,Raj>Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of

140
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,900
<4-21,Raj>都害怕伤害到别人的感受
<4-21,Raj>hurting someone's feelings as I am.

141
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,780
<4-22,Bernadette>才不是呢  我们俩刚可是当面笑话你
<4-22,Bernadette>That's not true. We were just laughing right in your face.

142
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,290
<5-1,Penny>谢谢你下厨做饭
<5-1,Penny>Thanks for cooking.

143
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,200
<5-2,Leonard>乐意之至
<5-2,Leonard>My pleasure.

144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,680
<5-3,Penny>-胡萝卜真好吃  -是啊
<5-3,Penny>- That carrot was delicious. - Yeah.

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,020
<5-4,Leonard>真希望我当时能勇猛点  守护好其余胡萝卜
<5-4,Leonard>I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of 'em.

146
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,210
<5-5,Penny>艾米还没理你吗
<5-5,Penny>Still haven't heard from her?

147
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,690
<5-6,Sheldon>没呢  我不明白
<5-6,Sheldon>No, and I'm confused.

148
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,780
<5-6,Sheldon>这都将近24小时了
<5-6,Sheldon>It's been nearly 24 hours.

149
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,120
<5-6,Sheldon>她现在应该意识到自己错了呀
<5-6,Sheldon>Amy should have figured out she's wrong by now.

150
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,900
<5-7,Penny>她觉得你俩发展太慢
<5-7,Penny>Hey, I don't think she's wrong

151
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,580
<5-7,Penny>这件事情我不觉得她有错
<5-7,Penny>about you going too slow in the relationship.

152
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,950
<5-8,Sheldon>太慢吗
<5-8,Sheldon>Too slow?

153
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,260
<5-9,Penny>是啊  你们俩都约会好几年了
<5-9,Penny>Yeah, you've been going out for years.

154
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,750
<5-9,Penny>至今还没上过床呢
<5-9,Penny>You haven't even slept together.

155
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,980
<5-10,Sheldon>没错  那叫前戏懂不懂
<5-10,Sheldon>That's right. It's called foreplay.

156
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,180
<5-10,Sheldon>而且我可以证明
<5-10,Sheldon>And I could make the case

157
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,970
<5-10,Sheldon>你们俩的发展现在也停滞不前
<5-10,Sheldon>that you two aren't moving forward in your relationship.

158
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,690
<5-11,Penny>请看
<5-11,Penny>Uh, hello.

<5-14,Sheldon>可你们俩订婚都一年多了
<5-14,Sheldon>But you've been engaged for over a year now,

162
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,030
<5-14,Sheldon>至今仍未定下婚期
<5-14,Sheldon>and you don't even have a wedding date.

<5-15,Penny>会定的  我们并不着急
<5-15,Penny>Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.

<5-20,Leonard>非常稳定
<5-20,Leonard>Really good.

169
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,510
<5-21,Penny>我忙于我的工作
<5-21,Penny>I'm focusing on my job.

170
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,700
<5-22,Leonard>我们也一直在忙我们的论文
<5-22,Leonard>And we've been busy with our paper.

171
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,440

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,610
<5-27,Penny>我完全明白为什么艾米会生气
<5-27,Penny>You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.

176
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,380
<5-28,Sheldon>就是  把嘴闭上  谢尔顿
<5-28,Sheldon>Yeah, shut up, Sheldon!

177
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,960
<6-1,Bernadette>是你把我的酸奶吃了吗
<6-1,Bernadette>Did you eat all my yogurt?

178
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,610
<6-2,Howard>你是说有助于女性做那件事的那玩意吗
<6-2,Howard>You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing

179
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,770
<6-2,Howard>那件你们明明做了
<6-2,Howard>that ladies pretend they don't do

180
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,290
<6-2,Howard>却要假装没做的"屎"
<6-2,Howard>even though they do?

181
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,290
<6-2,Howard>你知道
<6-2,Howard>You know...

182
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,580
<6-3,Bernadette>我说的是哪个酸奶
<6-3,Bernadette>which yogurt I mean.

183
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,720
<6-4,Howard>我没有碰过  肯定是斯尔图特吃的
<6-4,Howard>I didn't touch it. Must have been Stuart.

184
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,470
<6-5,Bernadette>或许拉杰说得对
<6-5,Bernadette>Maybe Raj is right.

185
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,370
<6-5,Bernadette>或许是时候我们让他搬走了
<6-5,Bernadette>Maybe it's time we tell him he needs to move out.

186
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,090
<6-6,Howard>我们几个月前就该这么做了
<6-6,Howard>We should have done it months ago.

187
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,330
<6-7,Bernadette>我知道  但碍于他的店重新开张
<6-7,Bernadette>I know, but his store was reopening,

188
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,960
<6-7,Bernadette>然后又各种过节  再然后他又生病了
<6-7,Bernadette>and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.

189
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,950
<6-8,Howard>是啊
<6-8,Howard>Yeah, right.

190
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,350
<6-8,Howard>生病  他根本没有黄疸
<6-8,Howard>Sick. He didn't have jaundice.

191
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,160
<6-8,Howard>他脸本来就蜡黄蜡黄的
<6-8,Howard>He just looks like that.

192
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,640
<6-9,Bernadette>行了  就今晚说吧
<6-9,Bernadette>All right. Tonight's the night.

193
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,400
<6-10,Howard>同意
<6-10,Howard>Agreed.

194
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,040
<6-10,Howard>等他一回家  我就单刀直入
<6-10,Howard>When he gets home, I'm dropping the hammer.

195
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,880
<6-11,Bernadette>我喜欢你当家做主的样子
<6-11,Bernadette>Ooh, I like when you take charge.

196
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,720
<6-12,Howard>我不是要当家做主  你是刀我负责拔刀而已
<6-12,Howard>Oh, I'm not taking charge-- you're the hammer.

197
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,920
<6-12,Howard>话说...
<6-12,Howard>So...

198
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,970
<7-1,Leonard>我们为什么没定下婚期
<7-1,Leonard>why haven't we picked a date?

199
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,860
<7-2,Penny>你知道原因
<7-2,Penny>You know why.

200
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,370
<7-3,Leonard>我当然知道啦
<7-3,Leonard>Well, of course I know why.

201
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,610
<7-3,Leonard>但只是好玩问问  为什么呀
<7-3,Leonard>But just for fun... why?

202
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,130
<7-4,Penny>不着急啊  忙于工作啊
<7-4,Penny>Not in a rush, busy with work...

203
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,380
<7-5,Sheldon>现在感情很稳定啊
<7-5,Sheldon>Things are good right now.

204
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,100
<7-6,Penny>非常稳定
<7-6,Penny>Really good.

205
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,630
<7-7,Leonard>你还是想跟我结婚的对吧
<7-7,Leonard>You still want to get married, right?

206
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,750
<7-8,Penny>天啊  当然啦  你干嘛问这种蠢问题
<7-8,Penny>Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?

207
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,870
<7-9,Leonard>不知道  或许因为我们没定婚期
<7-9,Leonard>I don't know. Because we don't have a date?

208
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,310
<7-10,Penny>那你想定婚期你定啊
<7-10,Penny>Well, you want a date, pick a date.

209
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,780
<7-11,Leonard>不光光是婚期
<7-11,Leonard>It's not just the date.

210
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,370
<7-11,Leonard>我们从来没谈过婚礼的事
<7-11,Leonard>We haven't talked about anything.

211

<7-11,Leonard>婚礼你想要大型还是小型  室内还是户外
<7-11,Leonard>Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor...

<7-13,Penny>行  那就室内  你喜欢大型还是小型
<7-13,Penny>Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?

<7-14,Leonard>Is your dad paying for it?

216
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,570
<7-15,Penny>深表怀疑
<7-15,Penny>I doubt it.

217

231
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,660
<8-2,Raj>在我这个岁数就英年早逝的可怜人儿
<8-2,Raj>who apparently died when she was the same age I am.

232
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,510
<8-3,Emily>会让你觉得活着真好  对吧
<8-3,Emily>Makes you feel alive, doesn't it?

233
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,780
<8-4,Raj>在灯光明亮的餐馆享用美食也有同等效果
<8-4,Raj>So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant,

234
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,590
<8-4,Raj>但我们还是选了这里
<8-4,Raj>but here we are.

235
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,750
<8-5,Emily>你不是在害怕吧
<8-5,Emily>You aren't scared, are you?

236
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,770
<8-6,Raj>怕鬼吗  才没有
<8-6,Raj>Of ghosts, no.

239
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,240
<9-1,Sheldon>我不应该问那么多问题
<9-1,Sheldon>I shouldn't have asked so many questions.

240
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,410
<9-2,Penny>不  没关系
<9-2,Penny>No, it's okay.

241

<9-3,Leonard>也许你让我们着手讨论这件事是正确的
<9-3,Leonard>Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff.

242
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,590
<9-4,Sheldon>哎哟哟  看看
<9-4,Sheldon>Well, look at that--

243
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,980
<9-4,Sheldon>我就算引发问题  也可以让世界变得更美好
<9-4,Sheldon>even when I'm causing problems, I make the world a better place.

244
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,260
<9-4,Sheldon>接下来让我们讨论一下你那唠叨的毛病
<9-4,Sheldon>Hey, next, why don't we tackle your penchant for whining

245
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,280
<9-4,Sheldon>还有佩妮对杯中物的痴迷吧
<9-4,Sheldon>and Penny's love of the ol' glug-glug?

246
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,090
<9-5,Penny>谢尔顿  不要再挑事了
<9-5,Penny>Uh, Sheldon, I think we're good for now.

247
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,650
<9-6,Sheldon>好吧  很好
<9-6,Sheldon>Ah, well... very well.

248
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,050
<9-6,Sheldon>这代表你们终于要定下婚期了吗
<9-6,Sheldon>So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date?

249
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,980
<9-7,Penny>又回到原点了
<9-7,Penny>Here we go again.

250
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,600
<9-7,Penny>为什么大家这么着急要我们定婚期呢
<9-7,Penny>Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date?

251
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,530
<9-7,Penny>我们忠于彼此  幸福快乐
<9-7,Penny>We're committed to each other. We're happy.

252
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,880
<9-7,Penny>一场婚礼并不会改变什么
<9-7,Penny>A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.

253
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,140
<9-8,Sheldon>所以你俩打算不结婚  对吗
<9-8,Sheldon>So you're never getting married?

254
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,280
<9-8,Sheldon>是因为他的唠叨  对吧
<9-8,Sheldon>It's his whining, isn't it?

255
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,310
<9-9,Leonard>谢尔顿  我不是个唠叨鬼
<9-9,Leonard>Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.

256
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,350
<9-10,Sheldon>他居然完全察觉不到  真是好笑
<9-10,Sheldon>It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.

257
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,010
<9-11,Leonard>佩妮的意思是我们深爱彼此
<9-11,Leonard>Look, all she's saying is we are in love

258
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,440
<9-11,Leonard>所以无所谓是明天结婚
<9-11,Leonard>so it doesn't matter if we get married tomorrow

259
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,750
<9-11,Leonard>明年结婚  还是50年后结婚
<9-11,Leonard>or a year from now or 50 years from now.

260
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,050
<9-12,Penny>50年后  那时我们都又老又丑了
<9-12,Penny>Ew, 50? We'll be old and gross.

261
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,510
<9-13,Leonard>没错  但是我们会一起变老变丑
<9-13,Leonard>Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.

262
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,060
<9-14,Sheldon>我阿姨和叔叔结婚63年了
<9-14,Sheldon>My aunt and uncle were married 63 years.

263
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,780
<9-14,Sheldon>到最后  他们像奶酪一样慢慢融化
<9-14,Sheldon>Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.

264
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,110
<9-15,Penny>我今晚就有空
<9-15,Penny>Um... I'm free tonight.

265
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,280
<9-16,Leonard>你是说你想结婚吗
<9-16,Leonard>Are you saying you want to get married?

266
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,510
<9-17,Penny>拉斯维加斯又不是太远
<9-17,Penny>Vegas isn't that far away.

267
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,900
<9-18,Leonard>我同意  我们结婚吧
<9-18,Leonard>I'm in. Let's do it.

268
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,360
<9-19,Sheldon>经过了这么多年的风风雨雨
<9-19,Sheldon>After all these years.

269
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,250
<9-19,Sheldon>我衷心为你们俩高兴
<9-19,Sheldon>I'm really happy for the two of you.

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,090
<9-20,Penny>-谢谢  -谢谢你
<9-20,Penny>- Oh, thank you. - Thanks.

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,410
<9-22,Sheldon>现在从我的专座上滚开
<9-22,Sheldon>Now get out of my spot.

<10-1,Howard>So remember,

274
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,060

<10-1,Howard>the key is to be firm.

<10-10,Howard>那个比真的莓果好吃多了
<10-10,Howard>They taste so much better than real berries.

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,850
<17-24,Leonard>我想跟你坦白
<17-24,Leonard>I wanted you to know.

360
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,900
<17-25,Penny>好吧
<17-25,Penny>All right.

361
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,590
<17-26,Leonard>那段时间你有没有干过类似的事...
<17-26,Leonard>Did you ever do anything like this since we've been...?

362
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,420
<17-27,Penny>从来没有
<17-27,Penny>Nope, never.

363
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,630
<17-28,Leonard>那太不巧了
<17-28,Leonard>Oh, that's too bad.

364
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,590
<17-29,Penny>我能问你个问题吗
<17-29,Penny>You know, can I ask you a question?

365
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,300
<17-31,Penny>为什么现在告诉我
<17-31,Penny>Why are you telling me this now?

366
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,400
<17-32,Leonard>正如之前所说  我们要结婚了
<17-32,Leonard>Well, like I said, we're about to get married,

367
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,090
<17-32,Leonard>我想做到坦诚相待
<17-32,Leonard>and I-I want a clean slate.

368
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,290
<17-32,Leonard>不藏秘密
<17-32,Leonard>No secrets.

369
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,840
<17-33,Penny>真的吗  可我怎么觉得是
<17-33,Penny>Really? Be-Because to me,

370
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
<17-33,Penny>我们要结婚了
<17-33,Penny>it seems like we're about to get married

371
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,650
<17-33,Penny>而你想搞破坏呢
<17-33,Penny>and you're trying to sabotage it.

372
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,470
<17-34,Leonard>那你比较希望我不告诉你吗
<17-34,Leonard>W-Would you rather I didn't tell you?

373
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,280
<17-35,Penny>不是  我不希望我们之间藏秘密
<17-35,Penny>No, I don't want there to be secrets between us.

374
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,470
<17-36,Leonard>这样我就不懂了
<17-36,Leonard>See, now I'm confused.

375
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,980
<17-36,Leonard>那我该怎么办
<17-36,Leonard>I mean, what-what am I supposed to do?

376
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,640
<17-37,Penny>让你的嘴别碰其他女人
<17-37,Penny>Uh, keep your mouth off other women.

377
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,160
<17-38,Leonard>我能做到
<17-38,Leonard>I can do that.

378
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,580
<17-38,Leonard>从今开始
<17-38,Leonard>Uh, uh, f-from now on,

379
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,370
<17-38,Leonard>这张嘴  除了你与食物啥都不碰
<17-38,Leonard>this mouth-- you and food, that's it.

380
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,200
<17-39,Penny>行吧
<17-39,Penny>Okay.

381
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,060
<17-40,Leonard>真的吗
<17-40,Leonard>Yeah?

382
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,320
<17-41,Penny>发生这种事我肯定不高兴
<17-41,Penny>Look, I'm not happy this happened,

383
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,770
<17-41,Penny>但我觉得我可以放下
<17-41,Penny>but I think I can get past it.

384
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,570
<17-41,Penny>毕竟那时候我们也没订婚
<17-41,Penny>I mean, we weren't engaged at the time,

385
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,450
<17-42,Leonard>而且只是接吻而已
<17-42,Leonard>and it was just kissing.

386
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,900
<17-42,Leonard>对啊
<17-42,Leonard>Right.

387
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,580
<17-43,Penny>接吻也不爽
<17-43,Penny>Just kissing.

388
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,420
<17-44,Leonard>感觉一点都不好
<17-44,Leonard>It wasn't even very good.

389
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,440
<17-44,Leonard>她满嘴烟味  我一直晕船呕吐...
<17-44,Leonard>She was a smoker. I'd just been seasick...

390
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,900
<17-45,Penny>够了  别说了
<17-45,Penny>Okay, that's enough. Stop talking.

391
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
<17-45,Penny>那...
<17-45,Penny>So...

392
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,030
<17-46,Leonard>我们还是会结婚的吧

<17-51,Penny>别得寸进尺
<17-51,Penny>Don't push it.
