1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,470
<1-1,Leonard>你们有听说过有个研究小组
<1-1,Leonard>Have you guys heard about this research team

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,400
<1-1,Leonard>想要从基因方面操控鸡的DNA
<1-1,Leonard>that's trying to genetically manipulate Chicken DNA

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,730
<1-1,Leonard>来创造某种类似鸡恐龙的事情吗
<1-1,Leonard>to create some sort of a chicken dinosaur?

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,050
<1-2,Sheldon>我觉得这听起来超赞啊
<1-2,Sheldon>I think that sounds wonderful.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,350
<1-3,Howard>什么  你不是又怕恐龙又怕鸡吗
<1-3,Howard>What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,210
<1-4,Sheldon>是啊  但你敢说
<1-4,Sheldon>Yes, but tell me

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,850
<1-4,Sheldon>鸡恐龙肉沙拉三明治
<1-4,Sheldon>a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,880
<1-4,Sheldon>不会正中美味白垩纪之点吗
<1-4,Sheldon>wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,960
<1-5,Raj>-你们好啊  -你好
<1-5,Raj>- Hey, guys. - Hey. Hello.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,250
<1-8,Raj>明晚都会出席的吧
<1-8,Raj>We still on for tomorrow night?

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,090
<1-9,Leonard>当然  我很期待终于能见到你的女朋友呢
<1-9,Leonard>Yeah. I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,950
<1-10,Sheldon>是啊  说到这事
<1-10,Sheldon>Yeah, oh, and speaking of which.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,180
<1-10,Sheldon>根据牛津大学最新的研究指出
<1-10,Sheldon>According to a recent study out of Oxford University,

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,790
<1-10,Sheldon>一个人有了新的浪漫伴侣之后
<1-10,Sheldon>when someone takes on a new romantic partner,

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,480
<1-10,Sheldon>会失去一到两个好朋友
<1-10,Sheldon>that person loses one or two close friends.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,990
<1-11,Howard>你什么时候开始看社会科学了
<1-11,Howard>Since when do you read social science?

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,110
<1-12,Sheldon>我也会上厕所  也需要厕所读物啊
<1-12,Sheldon>I go to the bathroom like everybody else.

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,870
<1-13,Raj>为什么我会因为有了对象而失去朋友呢
<1-13,Raj>Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,680
<1-14,Leonard>是啊  你跟艾米好上后  也没少了朋友啊
<1-14,Leonard>Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy.

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,080
<1-14,Leonard>人家研究是说浪漫伴侣
<1-14,Leonard>Yeah, well, no, the study refers to romantic partners.

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,360
<1-14,Leonard>我可不会把我们的关系归到这一类
<1-14,Leonard>Not the way I would categorize the two of us.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,740
<1-15,Raj>你们也接吻和牵手啊
<1-15,Raj>You guys kiss and hold hands.

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,530
<1-16,Leonard>我看过他们做这些事  完全不浪漫
<1-16,Leonard>I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,710
<1-17,Raj>我可不是那种
<1-17,Raj>Look, I'm not the kind of guy

25
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,310
<1-17,Raj>一谈恋爱就会重色轻友的人
<1-17,Raj>who drops his friends just because he's in a relationship.

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,430
<1-18,Leonard>要是她不喜欢我们呢
<1-18,Leonard>What happens if she doesn't like us?

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,480
<1-19,Raj>别这样  你们可是我的好朋友
<1-19,Raj>Well, hey, you're my dear friends.

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,950
<1-19,Raj>开始几年  我还是会给你们寄圣诞卡
<1-19,Raj>You'll get a Christmas card for a couple of years,

29
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,570
<1-19,Raj>之后你们哪凉快死哪去
<1-19,Raj>and then you're dead to me.

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,070
<2-1,Amy>霍华德  斯图尔特还跟你妈住在一起吗
<2-1,Amy>So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?

37
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,740
<2-2,Howard>我不想谈这事
<2-2,Howard>I don't want to talk about it.

38
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,700
<2-4,Howard>-但他还是会谈  -我妈帮他装了收费台
<2-4,Howard>- But he's going to. - My mom got him cable!

39
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,170
<2-4,Howard>我从小到大
<2-4,Howard>In my whole life,

40
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,010
<2-4,Howard>住在那个房子里  就没看过收费台
<2-4,Howard>growing up in that house-- no cable.

41
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,210
<2-4,Howard>你知道我妈付钱
<2-4,Howard>Do you know how many HBOs

42
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,730
<2-4,Howard>给那寄生虫装了多少电影频道吗  七个
<2-4,Howard>that leech had my mother get him? Seven.

43
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,690
<2-5,Bernadette>七个电影频道呢  七个啊
<2-5,Bernadette>Seven HBOs. Seven!

44
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,090
<2-5,Bernadette>长话短说  就是他们有七个电影频道
<2-5,Bernadette>Long story short, they have seven HBOs.

45

<2-15,Leonard>拉杰  你真的没骗我们
<2-15,Leonard>Well, Raj, you were not lying about her.

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,370
<2-16,Raj>我就说她真实存在
<2-16,Raj>I told you she exists.

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,250
<2-17,Penny>我听说你是皮肤科医生

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,030
<2-19,Sheldon>我好喜欢他们的急诊室
<2-19,Sheldon>Oh, I like their emergency room.

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,790
<2-19,Sheldon>就算检查结果显示你没得登革热
<2-19,Sheldon>Yeah, even if it turns out you don't have Dengue fever,

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,080
<2-19,Sheldon>你还是可以拿根棒棒糖
<2-19,Sheldon>they still let you take a lollipop.

59
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,830
<2-20,Bernadette>佩妮刚刚开始
<2-20,Bernadette>You know, Penny just started training

60
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,620
<2-20,Bernadette>医药销售的培训
<2-20,Bernadette>to be a pharmaceutical sales rep.

61
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,450
<2-20,Bernadette>或许有机会她可以跟你练习练习
<2-20,Bernadette>Maybe she can practice on you some time.

62
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,100
<2-21,Penny>如果能跟一名真医生练习就太好了
<2-21,Penny>Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.

63
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,060
<2-22,Emily>可以啊  没问题
<2-22,Emily>Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

64
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,090
<2-23,Sheldon>我的屁屁上有些奇怪的斑点
<2-23,Sheldon>I have some odd freckles on my buttocks.

65
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,910
<2-23,Sheldon>我能跟你约个时间就诊吗
<2-23,Sheldon>Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
<2-24,Emily>应该...  可以吧
<2-24,Emily>Um... okay, I guess.

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,240
<2-25,Amy>我都跟了他三年  毛都没捞着
<2-25,Amy>I'm with him three years, nothing.

68
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,190
<2-25,Amy>她刚进来两分钟  他就要对人脱裤子了
<2-25,Amy>She's with two minutes, and he's taking his pants off.

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,930
<3-1,Bernadette>昨晚挺有意思  你觉得艾米丽如何
<3-1,Bernadette>Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?

70
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,100
<3-1,Bernadette>不知道
<3-1,Bernadette>I don't know.

71
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,140
<3-2,Penny>我感觉她好像不太喜欢我
<3-2,Penny>I kind of got the sense she didn't like me.

72
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,700
<3-3,Bernadette>她有说她不喜欢你吗
<3-3,Bernadette>Did she say she didn't like you?

73
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,750
<3-4,Penny>当然没有  才不会有人
<3-4,Penny>Of course not. No one ever says

74
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,690
<3-4,Penny>当着你的面说不喜欢你呢
<3-4,Penny>they don't like you straight to your face.

75
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,340
<3-5,Amy>咱俩的人生路真是大不同啊
<3-5,Amy>We have led different lives.

76
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,780
<3-6,Bernadette>你们才刚认识  你怎么会有这种感觉呢
<3-6,Bernadette>You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?

77
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,120
<3-7,Penny>我就是感觉到了
<3-7,Penny>It's just this vibe I got.

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,050
<3-8,Bernadette>应该是你想太多了
<3-8,Bernadette>I'm sure you're worried about nothing.

79
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,010
<3-9,Penny>我想你说得对
<3-9,Penny>Yeah. You're probably right.

80
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,200
<3-9,Penny>我曾经以为我高中的体育老师不喜欢我
<3-9,Penny>I used to think my high school P.E. Teacher didn't like me,

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,680
<3-9,Penny>后来发现  她是"太"喜欢我
<3-9,Penny>but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.

82
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,440
<3-10,Bernadette>-真的吗  -是啊
<3-10,Bernadette>- Really? - Yeah.

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,090
<3-11,Penny>也还好啦
<3-11,Penny>It was fine.

84
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,460
<3-11,Penny>我们一起去了梅莉莎·埃瑟里奇的演唱会
<3-11,Penny>We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert,

85
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,030
<3-11,Penny>梅莉莎·埃瑟里奇  美国女歌手
<3-11,Penny>也是积极参与同志权利运动的社会活动家

86
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,030
<3-11,Penny>我后来成绩得了A  一切圆满
<3-11,Penny>I got an A, it all worked out.

87
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,550
<3-12,Bernadette>等你去她办公室练习  你就知道你多虑了
<3-12,Bernadette>When you go to Emily's office to practice, you'll see. It's fine.

88
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,270
<3-13,Penny>希望就像你说的吧
<3-13,Penny>Yeah, I hope you're right.

89
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,260
<3-14,Amy>你真的这辈子从未试过
<3-14,Amy>You really went your entire life

90
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,020
<3-14,Amy>有人当面对你说"我讨厌你"吗
<3-14,Amy>without anyone saying "I hate you" to your face?

91
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,910
<3-15,Penny>对啊
<3-15,Penny>Yeah.

92
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,390
<3-16,Amy>我现在就想对你说  但瞧你那迷人的颧骨
<3-16,Amy>I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.

93
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,440
<4-1,Sheldon>我好想念斯图尔特的店
<4-1,Sheldon>I miss Stuart's place.

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,250
<4-1,Sheldon>看这店吵杂的音乐  露出的砖墙
<4-1,Sheldon>All this loud music and exposed brick.

95
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,120
<4-1,Sheldon>这里是漫画书店
<4-1,Sheldon>What, is this a comic book store,

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,700
<4-1,Sheldon>还是第三只小猪砖房家中的派对啊
<4-1,Sheldon>or a rave at the third little pig's house?

97
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,030
<4-2,Howard>是啊  我也希望斯图尔特重新开店
<4-2,Howard>Yup, I wish Stuart would reopen.

98
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,000
<4-2,Howard>我也讨厌这家店
<4-2,Howard>I hate this place, too.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,700
<4-3,Leonard>我相信他是真心的
<4-3,Leonard>Okay, him I believe

100
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,190
<4-3,Leonard>因为他就是个80岁老头穿15岁小孩的衣服
<4-3,Leonard>because he's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

101
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,230
<4-3,Leonard>但你只是在不爽
<4-3,Leonard>But you're just upset about

102
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,100
<4-3,Leonard>斯图尔特和你妈以及他们的付费电影台
<4-3,Leonard>Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,290
<4-4,Howard>没错
<4-4,Howard>Yes, I am.

104
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,460
<4-4,Howard>我现在看《权力的游戏》时  都会想到
<4-4,Howard>You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now

105
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,080
<4-4,Howard>我妈在问他
<4-4,Howard>without thinking of mother saying,

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,990
<4-4,Howard>"斯图尔特  他们谁是'权力'"
<4-4,Howard>"Stuart, which one is Thrones?"

107
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,990
<4-5,Raj>他可能不能重新开张
<4-5,Raj>You know, he might not reopen.

108
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,100
<4-5,Raj>保险公司没赔给他多少钱
<4-5,Raj>He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,820
<4-6,Sheldon>天啊  如果有一件事能让我生气
<4-6,Sheldon>Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat,

110
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,850
<4-6,Sheldon>就是那些该死的保险公司
<4-6,Sheldon>it's those dad-gum insurance companies.

111
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,960
<4-7,Leonard>为什么  因为他们整天来烦你这死老头吗
<4-7,Leonard>Why? Because they won't get off your lawn?

112
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,590
<4-7,Leonard>斯尔图特有试着去贷款  或找人投资吗
<4-7,Leonard>Oh, is Stuart trying to get a loan, or-or find investors?

113
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,750
<4-8,Howard>我只知道他让我妈
<4-8,Howard>All I know is, he's got my mother

114
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,890
<4-8,Howard>给他买四层的厕纸
<4-8,Howard>buying four-ply toilet paper.

115
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,000
<4-8,Howard>四层的啊
<4-8,Howard>I mean, four-ply.

116
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,810
<4-8,Howard>如果他的屁股那么娇气
<4-8,Howard>If his butt is so delicate,

117
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,460
<4-8,Howard>干嘛不直接用安哥拉兔子擦呢
<4-8,Howard>why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?

118
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,930
<4-8,Howard>安哥拉兔毛颜色洁白  轻细  滑软  美观  暖和
<4-8,Howard>是一种高级纺织原料

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,930
<4-9,Sheldon>首先它们会掉毛  还会咬人
<4-9,Sheldon>For starters, they shed and bite.

120
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,510
<4-10,Leonard>我有个想法
<4-10,Leonard>Hey, here's a thought.

121
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,410
<4-10,Leonard>我们何不帮斯尔图特把剩下的钱凑够呢
<4-10,Leonard>Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?

122
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,760
<4-11,Raj>那我们就是漫画书店的店主了
<4-11,Raj>So, we'd be, like, owners of a comic book store?

123
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,210
<4-12,Leonard>就像是美梦成真
<4-12,Leonard>It's kind of a dream come true.

124
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,740
<4-13,Howard>听起来蛮有意思
<4-13,Howard>That does sound fun.

125
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,830
<4-14,Raj>或许我们还能想出
<4-14,Raj>Ooh, maybe we could come up

126
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,580
<4-14,Raj>一个跟这地方抗衡的商业计划
<4-14,Raj>with a business plan to compete with this place.

127
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,620
<4-15,Sheldon>我现在就有一个计划
<4-15,Sheldon>I'll give you a plan right now.

128
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,170
<4-15,Sheldon>第一步  开一家漫画书店
<4-15,Sheldon>Step one: open comic book store.

129
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,480
<4-15,Sheldon>第二步  散布谣言
<4-15,Sheldon>Step two: start rumor

130
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,680
<4-15,Sheldon>说这家漫画书店会让人得生殖器疣
<4-15,Sheldon>this comic book store gives you genital warts.

131
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,230
<4-15,Sheldon>第三步  买一个大袋子装钱
<4-15,Sheldon>Step three: buy a big bag to put the money in.

132
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,530
<4-16,Leonard>这计划还不错
<4-16,Leonard>It's not that bad.

133
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,090
<5-2,Emily>非常感谢你能当我的客户  让我练习推销说辞
<5-2,Emily>Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you.

134
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,150
<5-3,Penny>我真的感激不尽
<5-3,Penny>I really appreciate it.

135
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,040
<5-5,Penny>-没事  -我给你买了咖啡
<5-5,Penny>- Sure. - Um, I brought coffee.

136
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,480
<5-5,Penny>我不太确定你喜欢哪种  所以我买了
<5-5,Penny>I wasn't sure what you like, so I got

137
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,100
<5-5,Penny>普通咖啡  卡布奇诺和印度拉茶各一杯
<5-5,Penny>a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea.

138
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,610
<5-5,Penny>因为你喜欢拉杰  所以我想你可能喜欢印度口味
<5-5,Penny>Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.

139
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,560
<5-6,Emily>谢谢  我们开始吧  我有点忙
<5-6,Emily>Thanks. If we could get started. I'm a little busy.

140
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,080
<5-7,Penny>当然可以  让我先把材料拿出来
<5-7,Penny>Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials.

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,590
<5-7,Penny>这手提包是莱纳德给我的
<5-7,Penny>Leonard gave me this briefcase.

142
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,370
<5-7,Penny>他高中时随身带着它
<5-7,Penny>He used to carry it around in high school.

143
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,100
<5-7,Penny>所以老被人拿来打他  现在还能看见凹痕呢
<5-7,Penny>You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it.

144
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,680
<5-7,Penny>进入正题  我想介绍一下
<5-7,Penny>Okay, I would like to talk to you

145
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,280
<5-7,Penny>我们新出的避孕药  弗米拉
<5-7,Penny>about our new birth control pill, Femevra.

146
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,200
<5-8,Emily>好的
<5-8,Emily>Great.

147
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,650
<5-9,Penny>弗米拉三相口服避孕药
<5-9,Penny>So, Femevra's triphasic design

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,140
<5-9,Penny>每一周期仿造正常月经周期中荷尔蒙的变化
<5-9,Penny>含有三种不同比例的雌激素与黄体素

149
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,140
<5-9,Penny>能平衡荷尔蒙
<5-9,Penny>provides balanced hormonal exposure.

150
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,820
<5-10,Emily>好的
<5-10,Emily>All right.

151
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,130
<5-11,Penny>同时还有实验表明
<5-11,Penny>It has also been shown to cause

152
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,540
<5-11,Penny>它相比其他口服避孕药  副作用少了很多
<5-11,Penny>significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives.

153
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,900
<5-11,Penny>尽管它会导致长青春痘  但是我个人意见
<5-11,Penny>Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of

154
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,180
<5-11,Penny>这也能增加"避孕"的有效性  不是吗
<5-11,Penny>increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.

155
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,670
<5-12,Emily>呵呵
<5-12,Emily>Funny.

156
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,760
<5-13,Penny>抱歉  我一开始就给了你不好的印象吗
<5-13,Penny>Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot?

157
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,350
<5-13,Penny>因为从那晚开始  我就隐约感觉到
<5-13,Penny>Because since the other night, I kind of feel like

158
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,300
<5-13,Penny>你可能对我有意见
<5-13,Penny>you might have a problem with me.

159
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,900
<5-14,Emily>不  没有啊
<5-14,Emily>No, it's fine.

160
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,410
<5-15,Penny>你确定吗  因为看起来不像没有
<5-15,Penny>Are you sure, because it doesn't seem fine?

161
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,160
<5-15,Penny>好吧
<5-15,Penny>Okay.

162
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,140
<5-16,Emily>如果你真的想谈论此事
<5-16,Emily>If you really want to talk about this,

163
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,380
<5-16,Emily>我的确对你有意见
<5-16,Emily>I do have a problem.

164
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,470
<5-17,Penny>天啊  告诉我  我做错了什么
<5-17,Penny>Oh, my God. Tell me-- what did I do?

165
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,510
<5-18,Emily>其实没什么  只是...
<5-18,Emily>Look, it's nothing. It's just...

166
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,360
<5-18,Emily>拉杰告诉我  不久之前你们有过一段
<5-18,Emily>Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.

167
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,520
<5-19,Penny>什么  他为什么要说
<5-19,Penny>What?! Oh, why would he say that?

168
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,590
<5-20,Emily>那没有吗
<5-20,Emily>Did it not happen?

169
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,390
<5-21,Penny>确切来说  那不能称为"有过一段"
<5-21,Penny>Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a hook-up.

170
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,750
<5-22,Emily>你们接吻了吗
<5-22,Emily>Did you kiss?

171
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,920
<5-23,Penny>接了
<5-23,Penny>Yeah.

172
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,030
<5-24,Emily>你们俩脱光光了吗
<5-24,Emily>Were you naked?

173
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,460
<5-25,Penny>脱了
<5-25,Penny>Yeah.

174
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,490
<5-26,Emily>那就是啊
<5-26,Emily>So, it was a hook-up.

175
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,320
<5-26,Emily>不是
<5-26,Emily>No.

176
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,970
<5-26,Emily>算是吧
<5-26,Emily>Yeah.

177
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,580
<6-1,Sheldon>有什么办法能让我们的漫画书店
<6-1,Sheldon>So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store

178
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,210
<6-1,Sheldon>在同行中脱颖而出
<6-1,Sheldon>apart from the competition?

179
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,240
<6-2,Leonard>买漫画的都是小孩  如果能有办法
<6-2,Leonard>Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great

180
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,110
<6-2,Leonard>让更多的小孩来我们店  那就最好了
<6-2,Leonard>to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.

181
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,790
<6-3,Howard>在我小的时候  我喜欢去漫画书店
<6-3,Howard>You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there,

182
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,660
<6-3,Howard>但没人载我去
<6-3,Howard>but I could never get a ride.

183
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,250
<6-4,Raj>如果我们搞个面包车
<6-4,Raj>Ooh, what if we got a van

184
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,890
<6-4,Raj>专门在大街上接小孩呢
<6-4,Raj>and drove around and picked kids up?

185
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,500
<6-4,Raj>好主意
<6-4,Raj>Nice.

186
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,090
<6-5,Sheldon>你是说去公园和学校守着吗
<6-5,Sheldon>You mean, like at parks and schools?

187
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,770
<6-6,Howard>还有玩具店  木偶剧院
<6-6,Howard>Toy stores, puppet shows.

188
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,690
<6-7,Leonard>等等  你们的主意是搞个面包车
<6-7,Leonard>Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van

189
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,450
<6-7,Leonard>在大街上兜来兜去  专门接小孩吗
<6-7,Leonard>and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?

190
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,690
<6-8,Sheldon>是的
<6-8,Sheldon>Yes.

191
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,690
<6-9,Leonard>你们要用糖果引诱他们上车吗[绑架]
<6-9,Leonard>And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?

192
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,260
<6-10,Raj>这个主意好
<6-10,Raj>We are now!

193
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,430
<6-11,Penny>你告诉艾米丽我们有过一段吗
<6-11,Penny>You told Emily we hooked up?!

194
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,630
<6-12,Raj>我要辩一句  我告诉了所有人
<6-12,Raj>Um, well, in my defense, I tell everybody.

195
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,100
<6-13,Penny>你为什么要那样说
<6-13,Penny>Why would you say that?!

196
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,330
<6-14,Raj>我们当时在聊过去的爱人
<6-14,Raj>We were having a conversation about past lovers.

197
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,540
<6-15,Penny>我们不是爱人  拜托
<6-15,Penny>We weren't lovers! Come on.

198
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,800
<6-15,Penny>大家都知道我们没有上床
<6-15,Penny>Everyone knows we didn't sleep together.

199
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,100
<6-15,Penny>我们只是喝醉了鬼混而已
<6-15,Penny>We got drunk and fooled around.

200
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,810
<6-15,Penny>你们聊的时候就不能不说到我吗
<6-15,Penny>Why couldn't you just leave me out of it?

201
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,970
<6-16,Raj>我们说了要对彼此坦诚
<6-16,Raj>Well, we were being honest.

202
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,780
<6-16,Raj>那如果你甩了莱纳德后
<6-16,Raj>You would leave me out of the conversation

203
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,610
<6-16,Raj>你和下一个男人聊这话题时  不会说到他吗
<6-16,Raj>with the next guy if you dump Leonard?

204
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,820
<6-17,Leonard>-干嘛扯到我  -不会
<6-17,Leonard>- Why say it? - Yes!

205
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,590
<6-19,Raj>我决不会把你从我的名单除名
<6-19,Raj>Well, I would never leave you off my list,

206
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,320
<6-19,Raj>而且不是因为不提你
<6-19,Raj>and not just because, without you,

207
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,320
<6-19,Raj>"名单"可能就不太够数了哦
<6-19,Raj>we're playing fast and loose with the word "list."

208
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,900
<6-20,Penny>干得好  现在她讨厌我了
<6-20,Penny>Well, good job. Now she hates me.

209
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,680
<6-21,Raj>棒极了
<6-21,Raj>Great.

210
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,390
<6-22,Sheldon>往好的方面看  牛津大学的研究是对的
<6-22,Sheldon>On the bright side, that Oxford study was right.

211
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,470
<6-22,Sheldon>朋友减一了
<6-22,Sheldon>One friend down.

212
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,640
<6-22,Sheldon>我好奇下一个会是谁呢
<6-22,Sheldon>I wonder who you're going to lose next.

213
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,620
<6-23,Raj>你  就是你  下一个就是你
<6-23,Raj>You, okay? It's you. You're-you're next!

214
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,900
<6-24,Sheldon>才怪  你这么喜欢我
<6-24,Sheldon>No. You're crazy about me.

215
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,600
<7-1,Penny>我不懂艾米丽干嘛这么生气
<7-1,Penny>I don't know what Emily's so upset about anyway.

216
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,160
<7-1,Penny>就算我俩睡过了  那又怎样
<7-1,Penny>Even if I had slept with him, so what?

217
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,800
<7-3,Penny>每个人都有过去
<7-3,Penny>Everyone has a past.

218
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,200
<7-3,Penny>几乎每个人都有过去
<7-3,Penny>Almost everyone has a past.

219
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,480
<7-4,Bernadette>拜托  你这么漂亮
<7-4,Bernadette>Come on, look how pretty you are.

220
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,030
<7-4,Bernadette>她肯定不是第一个讨厌你的女生
<7-4,Bernadette>I'm sure this isn't the first girl to hate you.

221
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,820
<7-5,Penny>的确不是
<7-5,Penny>It's not.

222
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,900
<7-6,Bernadette>你肯定能改变她的想法
<7-6,Bernadette>And I'm sure you can turn it around.

223
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,550
<7-7,Penny>怎么改  总不能逼着别人喜欢你吧
<7-7,Penny>How? You can't force someone to like you.

224
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,860
<7-8,Amy>不如你多和她相处  装出闺蜜的样子
<7-8,Amy>What if you just hang around and act like her friend

225
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,260
<7-8,Amy>逐渐让她喜欢上你
<7-8,Amy>until you wear her down?

226
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,170
<7-8,Amy>接下来  你就登堂入室
<7-8,Amy>I mean, next thing you know, you're in her home,

227
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,550
<7-8,Amy>吃着她家的零食  喝着她家的美酒
<7-8,Amy>you're eating her food, drinking her wine.

228
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,490
<7-9,Penny>这招不管用
<7-9,Penny>No, that won't work.

229
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,420
<7-10,Amy>说得对  干杯
<7-10,Amy>You're right. Cheers.

230
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,440
<7-10,Amy>我知道了
<7-10,Amy>Oh, I know.

231
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,300
<7-11,Bernadette>干嘛不利用你的销售技巧
<7-11,Bernadette>Why don't you use your sales training

232
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,500
<7-11,Bernadette>好好向她推销一番你自己呢
<7-11,Bernadette>to go back down there and sell yourself?

233
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,830
<7-12,Penny>-什么  -真的
<7-12,Penny>- What? - Yeah.

234
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,000
<7-13,Bernadette>不是去推销药物
<7-13,Bernadette>But instead of selling a drug,

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,120
<7-13,Bernadette>而是去推销佩妮  多可爱啊
<7-13,Bernadette>you'd be selling Penny-- it's cute.

236
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,750
<7-14,Penny>多傻逼啊
<7-14,Penny>It's stupid.

237
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,140
<7-15,Bernadette>要是你不这么鄙视来否定别人的建议
<7-15,Bernadette>Well, maybe people would like you more

238
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,750
<7-15,Bernadette>大家也许会更喜欢你
<7-15,Bernadette>if you didn't crap all over their ideas.

239
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,630
<7-16,Amy>这一点我同意佩妮的看法
<7-16,Amy>I'm gonna go with Penny on this one.

240
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,000
<7-16,Amy>这也是理所当然的  我们可是老朋友了
<7-16,Amy>Then again, why wouldn't I? I mean, we go way back.

241
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,200
<7-17,Penny>对哦  我以前不喜欢你呢
<7-17,Penny>Oh, my God. I didn't used to like you.

242
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,550
<7-18,Amy>别说  艾米在这会听到
<7-18,Amy>Shh. Amy's here now.

243
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,960
<8-1,Sheldon>我越考虑开店这事
<8-1,Sheldon>You know, the more I think about it,

244
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,740
<8-1,Sheldon>就越觉得有兴趣
<8-1,Sheldon>the more intrigued I am about having our own store.

245
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,550
<8-2,Howard>新书还没上架
<8-2,Howard>We'll get to see all the new stuff

246
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,230
<8-2,Howard>我们早就看过了
<8-2,Howard>before it hits the shelves.

247
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,130
<8-3,Sheldon>我们还能和顾客们友好互动
<8-3,Sheldon>And we'll get to have fun interactions with our customers.

248
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,550
<8-3,Sheldon>"这里不是图书馆  不买就滚"
<8-3,Sheldon>"This isn't a library-- buy it or get out."

249
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,710
<8-4,Howard>你不是整天对人这么说吗
<8-4,Howard>You say things like that all the time.

250
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,230
<8-5,Sheldon>是啊  可我要是店主
<8-5,Sheldon>Yes, but as a store owner,

251
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,900
<8-5,Sheldon>别人说"店又不是你开的  闭嘴"时
<8-5,Sheldon>I'll finally have a good comeback to,

252
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,810
<8-5,Sheldon>我就能理直气壮顶回去了
<8-5,Sheldon>"You don't work here-- shut up."

253
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,990
<8-6,Leonard>你记得佩妮对拉杰说
<8-6,Leonard>Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have

254
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,340
<8-6,Leonard>-把她从名单上划掉吗  -记得
<8-6,Leonard>- left her off his list? - Yeah.

255
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,400
<8-8,Leonard>那你觉得我跟她聊这事时
<8-8,Leonard>Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation,

256
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,010
<8-8,Leonard>她是不是也划掉了某些人呢
<8-8,Leonard>she left people off her list?

257
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,590
<8-9,Sheldon>肯定啊
<8-9,Sheldon>I'm sure she did.

258
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,980
<8-10,Leonard>为什么
<8-10,Leonard>Why?

259
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,510
<8-11,Sheldon>如果她一个都没省略
<8-11,Sheldon>Because if she hadn't,

260
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,190
<8-11,Sheldon>那名单现在还没念完呢
<8-11,Sheldon>she'd still be wading through the list.

261
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,800
<8-12,Leonard>你能不能别凑进来
<8-12,Leonard>Will you stay out of this?

262
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,540
<8-13,Sheldon>这句话应该是佩妮的台词吧
<8-13,Sheldon>If only Penny had said that once in a while.

263
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,050
<8-14,Howard>那又有什么关系呢
<8-14,Howard>Hey, what difference does it make?

264
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,000
<8-14,Howard>你才是她想嫁的那个人
<8-14,Howard>You're the one she wants to marry.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,890
<8-15,Leonard>说得对
<8-15,Leonard>That's true.

266
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,240
<8-16,Howard>而且我觉得恋人之间的绝对坦诚
<8-16,Howard>Yeah, and I'm not sure that complete honesty

267
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,080
<8-16,Howard>不一定是件好事
<8-16,Howard>is always the best thing for a relationship.

268
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,330
<8-16,Howard>他说得对
<8-16,Howard>Yeah, he's right.

269
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,350
<8-17,Sheldon>有一次我向艾米坦白
<8-17,Sheldon>Once, in a moment of candor,

270
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,140
<8-17,Sheldon>说她的头发让我想起了
<8-17,Sheldon>I told Amy that her hair reminded me

271
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,280
<8-17,Sheldon>沾满泄漏的石油的海鸭  结果...
<8-17,Sheldon>of a duck caught in an oil spill. Well...

272
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,250
<8-17,Sheldon>她气得夺门而出
<8-17,Sheldon>she stormed out.

273
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,980
<8-17,Sheldon>实在可悲  因为我们正在玩拼字游戏
<8-17,Sheldon>Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble,

274
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,050
<8-17,Sheldon>我马上就要拼出"美洲柿"这词了
<8-17,Sheldon>and I had all the letters to spell "persimmon."

275
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,830
<8-18,Leonard>你跟我们瞎凑什么热闹啊
<8-18,Leonard>Why are you even part of this conversation?

276
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,690
<8-18,Leonard>你根本就不懂女人
<8-18,Leonard>You don't know anything about women.

277
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,360
<8-19,Sheldon>我知道如果我有老婆或未婚妻
<8-19,Sheldon>I know that if I had a wife or a fiance,

278
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,400
<8-19,Sheldon>那我投资漫画书店之前
<8-19,Sheldon>I'd ask her first before I invested money

279
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,490
<8-20,Howard>肯定先问问她的意见
<8-20,Howard>in a comic book store.

280
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,650
<8-20,Howard>他说得对
<8-20,Howard>He's right.

281
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,250
<8-21,Sheldon>我当然说得对
<8-21,Sheldon>Yeah, well, of course I am.

282
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,800
<8-21,Sheldon>我对她头发的评价也是对的
<8-21,Sheldon>I was also right about her hair.

283
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,910
<8-21,Sheldon>跟鸭子完全一样  除了不嘎嘎叫
<8-21,Sheldon>It did everything but quack.

284
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,250
<9-1,Leonard>有件事我想告诉你一下
<9-1,Leonard>There's something I wanted to run past you.

285
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,340
<9-2,Penny>什么事
<9-2,Penny>What's up?

286
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,230
<9-3,Leonard>我和小伙伴们准备
<9-3,Leonard>Mm, the guys and I were thinking about

287
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,220
<9-3,Leonard>投资斯图尔特的漫画书店
<9-3,Leonard>investing in Stuart's comic book store.

288
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,690
<9-4,Penny>-你觉得好吗  -干嘛问我
<9-4,Penny>- Is that okay? - Why are you asking me?

289
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,520
<9-5,Leonard>我们订婚了
<9-5,Leonard>Well, you know, we're engaged,

290
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,030
<9-6,Penny>这可是重大的财务问题
<9-6,Penny>and it's kind of a big deal financially.

291
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,330
<9-5,Leonard>我想我俩应该讨论一下
<9-5,Leonard>It seems like something we should talk about.

292
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,000
<9-6,Penny>那你觉得身负大笔信用卡债务
<9-6,Penny>Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt

293
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,600
<9-6,Penny>算不算重大的财务问题呢
<9-6,Penny>kind of a big deal financially?

294
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,800
<9-6,Penny>算
<9-6,Penny>Yeah.

295
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
<10-1,Howard>我和小伙伴们在讨论
<10-1,Howard>So, me and the guys were talking about

296
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,410
<10-1,Howard>这个绝佳的投资机会
<10-1,Howard>this great investment opportunity...

297
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,250
<10-2,Bernadette>不行
<10-2,Bernadette>Nope.

298
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,180
<10-3,Howard>你都不知道是什么呢
<10-3,Howard>But you didn't hear what it was.

299
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,440
<10-4,Bernadette>我能猜到
<10-4,Bernadette>I know.

300
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,850
<10-5,Howard>别这样嘛
<10-5,Howard>Oh, come on.

301
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,050
<10-6,Bernadette>好吧  是什么
<10-6,Bernadette>Fine. What is it?

302
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,360
<10-7,Howard>我们想帮忙重开漫画书店
<10-7,Howard>It's to help reopen the comic book store.

303
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,980
<10-8,Bernadette>不行
<10-8,Bernadette>Nope.

304
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,160
<10-9,Howard>听我说完嘛
<10-9,Howard>Well, hear me out.

305
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,330
<10-10,Bernadette>霍华德  你知道我们在存钱买房子
<10-10,Bernadette>Howard, you know we're saving up for a house.

306
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,290
<10-11,Howard>我知道  可大家都会入伙
<10-11,Howard>I know, but all the guys are doing it.

307
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,660
<10-11,Howard>一人只需出四分之一
<10-11,Howard>We're splitting it four ways,

308
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,930
<10-11,Howard>所以不会花太多钱
<10-11,Howard>so it's really not that much money.

309
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,600
<10-12,Bernadette>这投资感觉风险挺大
<10-12,Bernadette>It just seems like a risky investment.

310
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,020
<10-13,Howard>我明白
<10-13,Howard>I get that. I...

311
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,910
<10-13,Howard>听我说
<10-13,Howard>Okay, look...

312
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,920
<10-13,Howard>我非常想开店的原因是
<10-13,Howard>The reason this is important is...

313
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,690
<10-13,Howard>在我爸抛弃我和妈妈之前
<10-13,Howard>...before my dad left me and my mom...

314
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,300
<10-13,Howard>他经常带我去漫画店
<10-13,Howard>he used to... take me to the comic book store.

315
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,130
<10-13,Howard>这是我们拥有过为数不多的父子时光
<10-13,Howard>It was one of the few things we did together.

316
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
<10-14,Bernadette>华仔  我不知道这件事
<10-14,Bernadette>Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

317
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,630
<10-15,Howard>我也...不爱对人提这件事
<10-15,Howard>Well, I don't... like to talk about it.

318
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,400
<10-16,Bernadette>亲爱的
<10-16,Bernadette>Oh, baby.

319
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,500
<10-16,Bernadette>这事是你瞎掰的  对吗
<10-16,Bernadette>That story's made up, isn't it?

320
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,200
<10-17,Howard>为了买下漫画店  我豁出去了
<10-17,Howard>That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.

321
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,860
<11-1,Sheldon>我希望你能诚实地给我一些意见
<11-1,Sheldon>I'd like your honest opinion on something.

322
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,780
<11-2,Amy>没问题
<11-2,Amy>Of course.

323
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,490
<11-3,Sheldon>在我提问前
<11-3,Sheldon>Now, before I start,

324
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,900
<11-3,Sheldon>你要知道  我对此事非常激动
<11-3,Sheldon>I need you to know that I'm very excited about this,

325
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,130
<11-3,Sheldon>所以你所说的每一句话
<11-3,Sheldon>and anything you say

326
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,190
<11-3,Sheldon>如果不够掏心掏肺百分百支持
<11-3,Sheldon>that isn't enthusiastically supportive

327
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,770
<11-3,Sheldon>将会令我们的感情产生问题
<11-3,Sheldon>will throw our entire relationship into question.

328
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,800
<11-3,Sheldon>所以
<11-3,Sheldon>So...

329
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,440
<11-3,Sheldon>保持开放的心态
<11-3,Sheldon>keep an open mind.

330
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,790
<11-4,Amy>我感觉无路可走唯有附和了  谢尔顿
<11-4,Amy>I'm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.

331
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,100
<11-5,Sheldon>这就对了  现在
<11-5,Sheldon>Perfect. Now...

332
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,310
<11-5,Sheldon>我在考虑投资
<11-5,Sheldon>...I'm considering investing

333
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,150
<11-5,Sheldon>斯图尔特的漫画店
<11-5,Sheldon>in Stuart's comic book store.

334
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,770
<11-6,Amy>有意思
<11-6,Amy>Interesting.

335
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,150
<11-6,Amy>你不觉得一个成年男子
<11-6,Amy>Can you see how a grown man,

336
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,260
<11-6,Amy>而且是颇有成就的科学家
<11-6,Amy>an accomplished scientist,

337
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,180
<11-6,Amy>投资一家
<11-6,Amy>who invests in a store

338
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,320
<11-6,Amy>出售图画书
<11-6,Amy>that sells picture books

339
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,810
<11-6,Amy>主角是穿着色彩斑斓内裤的飞人们
<11-6,Amy>about flying men in colorful underwear...

340
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,140
<11-6,Amy>也许是浪费他的财务
<11-6,Amy>...might be wasting both his financial

341
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,860
<11-6,Amy>和智力资源吗
<11-6,Amy>and intellectual resources?

342
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,280
<11-7,Sheldon>不觉得
<11-7,Sheldon>No.

343
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,150
<11-8,Amy>那我觉得这个想法太棒了
<11-8,Amy>Then I think it's a terrific idea.

344
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,040
<11-8,Amy>很好
<11-8,Amy>Great.

345

<12-7,Raj>And when I say "love," I meant as a friend.

356
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,780
<12-7,Raj>咱俩之间说"爱"太快了  对吗
<12-7,Raj>And, uh, way too soon, right?

357
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,330
<12-8,Penny>坐下吧  听我说  艾米莉
<12-8,Penny>Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily,

358
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,860
<12-8,Penny>我和拉杰的事
<12-8,Penny>what happened between me and Raj

359
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,490
<12-8,Penny>-已经是陈年旧事了  -没错
<12-8,Penny>- was a long time ago. - It was,

360
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,000
<12-9,Raj>而且我也不该在这件事上小题大作
<12-9,Raj>and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.

361
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,580
<12-10,Penny>现在莱纳德和我订婚了
<12-10,Penny>Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now,

362
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,460
<12-10,Penny>我希望这事大家就既往不咎吧
<12-10,Penny>and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.

363
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,290
<12-11,Emily>我也希望这样
<12-11,Emily>I'd like that, too.

364
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,150
<12-11,Emily>我本来以为我不会心里不舒服
<12-11,Emily>Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it,

365
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,160
<12-11,Emily>但结果看到你这么漂亮
<12-11,Emily>but then I saw how pretty you are.

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,000
<12-12,Penny>你嘴真甜

<12-12,Penny>瞧你  这么美
<12-12,Penny>I mean, look at you-- you are gorgeous.

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,840
<12-13,Raj>没错  你俩都美呆了
<12-13,Raj>It's true-- you're both gorgeous.

369
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,330
<12-13,Raj>把这两朵娇花带上床的男人该有多优秀啊
<12-13,Raj>Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both.

370
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,290
<12-13,Raj>你明白为啥我大半辈子都孤单一人了吧
<12-13,Raj>You get why I've been alone most of my adult life.

371
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,780
<13-1,Stuart>什么风把你们吹来了
<13-1,Stuart>So, what brings you by?

373
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,380
<13-3,Stuart>确切来说  这是你妈妈的房子  但是
<13-3,Stuart>Technically, it's your mom's house, but...

374
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,580
<13-3,Stuart>我们还是希望你能觉得自己是受欢迎的
<13-3,Stuart>we certainly want you to feel welcome.

375

<13-6,Bernadette>to help you reopen the store,

380
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,290
<13-6,Bernadette>但在投资前  我有些问题要问
<13-6,Bernadette>but before that happens, I have a few questions.

<13-7,Stuart>I appreciate the offer,

382
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,320
<13-7,Stuart>但你妈妈已经给我钱了
<13-7,Stuart>but actually your mother already gave me the money.

383
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,350
<13-8,Howard>什么

389
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,770
<13-10,Howard>你怎能同时拥有两个小乖乖呢
<13-10,Howard>You can't have more than one bubala!
