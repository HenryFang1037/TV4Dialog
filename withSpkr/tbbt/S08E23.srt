1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,940
<1-1,Penny>莱纳德  你妈妈的飞机什么时候到
<1-1,Penny>Leonard, what time does your mom's plane get in?

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,900
<1-2,Leonard>不知道  明天早上的某个时候吧
<1-2,Leonard>I don't know-- some time tomorrow morning.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,250
<1-3,Penny>你不去确定下确切时间吗
<1-3,Penny>Don't you want to know for sure?

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,150
<1-4,Leonard>不必
<1-4,Leonard>No need to.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,250
<1-4,Leonard>只要她的飞机一进入加州领空
<1-4,Leonard>As soon as she flies into California airspace,

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,980
<1-4,Leonard>我就能感觉到原力一阵扰动
<1-4,Leonard>I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,790
<1-5,Amy>真好  你们两个人的母亲
<1-5,Amy>It's so nice both of your moms are coming in

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,800
<1-5,Amy>都专程飞过来看你们领奖
<1-5,Amy>to see you guys get an award.

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,820
<1-6,Sheldon>每次得奖我妈妈都会陪在我身边
<1-6,Sheldon>Well, my mother's been there for every honor I've won

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,310
<1-6,Sheldon>这个传统从我打败双胞胎姐姐
<1-6,Sheldon>since I beat out my twin sister

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,420
<1-6,Sheldon>赢得"学会用便盆"就开始了
<1-6,Sheldon>for the "Did it on the potty" trophy.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,000
<1-6,Sheldon>这看起来怎么样
<1-6,Sheldon>How does this look?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,130
<1-7,Penny>很好看  她一定会喜欢
<1-7,Penny>Aw, it's so nice. She's gonna love it.

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,150
<1-8,Amy>是啊  他妈妈就能有玫瑰
<1-8,Amy>Sure, his mom gets roses.

15
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,040
<1-8,Amy>我说我想要玫瑰
<1-8,Amy>When I want them,

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,880
<1-8,Amy>他说玫瑰是"一束被砍下来的植物性器官"
<1-8,Amy>they're a "bouquet of severed plant genitals."

17
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,240
<1-9,Sheldon>你说得好像情人节
<1-9,Sheldon>You act like I didn't get you

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,250
<1-9,Sheldon>我没送过你蘑菇养殖木一样
<1-9,Sheldon>that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,310
<1-9,Sheldon>他说得对
<1-9,Sheldon>He's right.

20
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,910
<1-10,Amy>玫瑰会枯萎  但一段潮湿腐烂的木头能让
<1-10,Amy>Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms

21
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,190
<1-10,Amy>蘑菇长个美好的两三年呢
<1-10,Amy>for two or three magical years.

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,290
<1-11,Penny>你妈妈一直对我们的感情不太感冒
<1-11,Penny>You know, your mom's never been too thrilled with our relationship.

23
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,720
<1-11,Penny>或许我该给她点什么  让她能慢慢接受我
<1-11,Penny>Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,390
<1-12,Leonard>如果你能出去弄个博士学位
<1-12,Leonard>If you could run out and get a PhD,

25
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,410
<1-12,Leonard>她说不定就会喜欢你啦
<1-12,Leonard>that might make her like you.

26
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
<1-13,Penny>是吗  你这个博士也没赢得她的欢心啊
<1-13,Penny>Really? It didn't work for you.

27
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,870
<1-14,Amy>你们觉得两位妈妈处得来吗
<1-14,Amy>Do you think the moms will get along?

28
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,430
<1-15,Leonard>不知道  她们两人差别挺大
<1-15,Leonard>Uh, I don't know. They're pretty different.

29
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,040
<1-16,Sheldon>说不定能成为挚友啊
<1-16,Sheldon>Maybe they'll be best friends.

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,310
<1-16,Sheldon>她们一人聪明绝顶  一人善良单纯
<1-16,Sheldon>One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple.

31
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,640
<1-16,Sheldon>有没有种熟悉的感觉
<1-16,Sheldon>Sound familiar?

38
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,530
<2-1,Mrs Cooper>谢利  你跟莱纳德得到这个奖让我十分骄傲
<2-1,Mrs Cooper>Shelly, I'm so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.

39
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,650
<2-2,Sheldon>谢谢你  母亲
<2-2,Sheldon>Oh, thank you, Mother.

40
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,760
<2-3,Mrs Cooper>我有试着读你的论文  但是太深了
<2-3,Mrs Cooper>I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard

41
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,360
<2-3,Mrs Cooper>我读不懂
<2-3,Mrs Cooper>for me to understand.

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,370
<2-4,Sheldon>其实还挺好理解的啦
<2-4,Sheldon>Oh, it's quite straightforward, actually.

43
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,930
<2-4,Sheldon>它描述了一种新的宇宙模型
<2-4,Sheldon>It describes a new model of the universe

44
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,140
<2-4,Sheldon>将宇宙构想成
<2-4,Sheldon>that conceptualizes it as the surface

45
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,960
<2-4,Sheldon>n维超流体的表面
<2-4,Sheldon>of an n-dimensional superfluid.

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,920
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>有意思
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>Interesting.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,050
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>你相信这个
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>You can believe that,

48
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,790
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>却不信上帝在方舟上雌雄各一地装了各种动物
<2-5,Mrs Cooper>but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,150
<2-6,Sheldon>母亲  那他们用什么喂狮子呢
<2-6,Sheldon>What did they feed the lions, Mother?

50
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,150
<2-7,Mrs Cooper>被大洪水淹死  漂来漂去的罪人尸体啊
<2-7,Mrs Cooper>The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.

51
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,790
<2-8,Sheldon>听我说  莱纳德的母亲是一位知名心理学家
<2-8,Sheldon>Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned psychiatrist

52
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,160
<2-8,Sheldon>与一名女科学家
<2-8,Sheldon>and woman of science.

53
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,040
<2-8,Sheldon>能不能请你把你那些圣经碎话收着
<2-8,Sheldon>Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,690
<2-8,Sheldon>别在她面前说
<2-8,Sheldon>while she's here?

55
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,620
<2-9,Mrs Cooper>你觉得我让你丢人了吗
<2-9,Mrs Cooper>Are you ashamed of me?

56
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,240
<2-10,Sheldon>当然不是啦  我最爱你了
<2-10,Sheldon>Of course not. I love you.

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,280
<2-10,Sheldon>我只对你的信仰  行为和话语感到丢人
<2-10,Sheldon>I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.

58
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,980
<2-11,Mrs Cooper>好吧  我也爱你
<2-11,Mrs Cooper>Well, I love you, too.

59
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,700
<2-11,Mrs Cooper>我那喂狮子的小宝贝
<2-11,Mrs Cooper>My little bowl of lion chow.

60
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,360
<3-1,Dr Hofstadter>你跟佩妮定下婚礼的日子了吗
<3-1,Dr Hofstadter>So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,630
<3-2,Leonard>没呢  我们打算慢慢来
<3-2,Leonard>No, we're kind of taking it slow.

62
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,480
<3-3,Dr Hofstadter>呵呵
<3-3,Dr Hofstadter>I see.

63
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,280
<3-4,Leonard>你这是什么意思
<3-4,Leonard>What does that mean?

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,110
<3-5,Dr Hofstadter>你跟这个女人分分合合七年了
<3-5,Dr Hofstadter>You've been on and off with this woman for seven years

65
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,880
<3-5,Dr Hofstadter>然后也订婚一年了
<3-5,Dr Hofstadter>and engaged for one year.

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,230
<3-5,Dr Hofstadter>让人不禁疑惑
<3-5,Dr Hofstadter>One has to wonder if there's a problem.

67
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,640
<3-5,Dr Hofstadter>你们俩性生活还行吗
<3-5,Dr Hofstadter>Are you having satisfactory intercourse?

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,780
<3-6,Leonard>是的  母亲
<3-6,Leonard>Yes, Mother.

69
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,490
<3-7,Dr Hofstadter>所以只是还行  呵呵
<3-7,Dr Hofstadter>Only satisfactory. I see.

70
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,890
<3-8,Leonard>我换下答案
<3-8,Leonard>I change my answer.

71
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,150
<3-8,Leonard>是很棒  超热辣
<3-8,Leonard>It-it's amazing. It's hot.

72
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,960
<3-8,Leonard>一看到对方就天雷勾动地火
<3-8,Leonard>We can barely keep our hands off each other.

73
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,860
<3-9,Dr Hofstadter>试图靠炫耀床上功夫
<3-9,Dr Hofstadter>Seems odd to try and impress your mother

74
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,570
<3-9,Dr Hofstadter>来取悦你的母亲有些怪吧
<3-9,Dr Hofstadter>with your sexual prowess.

75
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,000
<3-9,Dr Hofstadter>不过你也的确一直有恋母情结
<3-9,Dr Hofstadter>But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.

76
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,020
<3-10,Leonard>你看  就是你现在这样
<3-10,Leonard>See, this right here, what you're doing,

77
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,470
<3-10,Leonard>能不能求你别在谢尔顿他妈妈面前这样
<3-10,Leonard>can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom?

78
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,210
<3-11,Dr Hofstadter>为什么  你也恋上她了吗
<3-11,Dr Hofstadter>Why? Are you attracted to her, too?

79
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,220
<3-11,Dr Hofstadter>当然没有啦
<3-11,Dr Hofstadter>Of course not.

80
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,480
<3-12,Leonard>她就只是个很善良很虔诚的女士
<3-12,Leonard>She's-she's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady,

81
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,490
<3-12,Leonard>所以请你对她的信仰表达尊重
<3-12,Leonard>and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.

82
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,840
<3-13,Dr Hofstadter>莱纳德  我是个成人
<3-13,Dr Hofstadter>Leonard, I'm an adult.

83
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,150
<3-13,Dr Hofstadter>我知道如何在各式各样的人面前
<3-13,Dr Hofstadter>I know how to conduct myself around people

84
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,090
<3-13,Dr Hofstadter>保持风度
<3-13,Dr Hofstadter>from different walks of life.

85
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,010
<3-14,Leonard>谢谢
<3-14,Leonard>Thank you.

86
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,990
<3-15,Dr Hofstadter>她是哪里人来着
<3-15,Dr Hofstadter>Where is she from again?

87
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,880
<3-16,Leonard>德州东部
<3-16,Leonard>East Texas.

88
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,190
<3-18,Leonard>看看谁来啦
<3-18,Leonard>Hey, look who's here.

89
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,430
<3-19,Sheldon>霍夫斯塔德博士  真高兴再见到你
<3-19,Sheldon>Oh, Dr. Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.

90
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,590
<3-20,Dr Hofstadter>我也是
<3-20,Dr Hofstadter>Likewise.

91
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,050
<3-20,Dr Hofstadter>我读了你的论文  非常棒
<3-20,Dr Hofstadter>I read your paper; it was very impressive.

92
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,360
<3-21,Sheldon>谢谢
<3-21,Sheldon>Oh, thank you.

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,310
<3-22,Leonard>我们刚开了两小时的车回来
<3-22,Leonard>We just spent two hours in traffic.

94
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,390
<3-22,Leonard>在路上你怎么没想过要说你喜欢我们的论文呢
<3-22,Leonard>Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?

95
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,710
<3-23,Dr Hofstadter>我当然想过  但一位母亲的职责
<3-23,Dr Hofstadter>Of course I did, but it's a mother's job

96
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,680
<3-23,Dr Hofstadter>就是得确保自己孩子的自尊
<3-23,Dr Hofstadter>to make sure her child's self-esteem

97
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,240
<3-23,Dr Hofstadter>不是建立靠得到他人肯定上
<3-23,Dr Hofstadter>is not dependent on anyone's approval.

98
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,020
<3-24,Leonard>真好  你觉得我还有自尊心
<3-24,Leonard>That's so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.

99
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,690
<3-25,Sheldon>霍夫斯塔德博士  这位是我的母亲玛丽
<3-25,Sheldon>Dr. Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.

100
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,540
<3-26,Dr Hofstadter>很高兴见到你
<3-26,Dr Hofstadter>So nice to meet you.

101
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,690
<3-27,Mrs Cooper>幸会幸会  飞得还顺利吗
<3-27,Mrs Cooper>Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?

102
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,030
<3-28,Dr Hofstadter>很好  你的呢
<3-28,Dr Hofstadter>Very pleasant. And yours?

103
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,060
<3-29,Mrs Cooper>非常好  仿佛某位...
<3-29,Mrs Cooper>Lovely. Almost as if someone--

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,170
<3-29,Mrs Cooper>不说是谁了  从飞机上方庇佑着我们
<3-29,Mrs Cooper>not saying who-- was watching over the plane.

105
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,410
<3-30,Dr Hofstadter>你是在开玩笑的吧
<3-30,Dr Hofstadter>You're kidding, right?

106
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,400
<3-31,Leonard>妈  你真是一点都不明显啊
<3-31,Leonard>Subtle, Mom, real subtle.

107
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,200
<4-1,Bernadette>斯图尔特
<4-1,Bernadette>Stuart.

108
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,080
<4-2,Stuart>早安
<4-2,Stuart>Morning.

109
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,040
<4-3,Bernadette>我们谈过这事了
<4-3,Bernadette>We talked about this.

110
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,260
<4-3,Bernadette>我不介意你继续住在这里
<4-3,Bernadette>I don't mind you still living here,

111
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,830
<4-3,Bernadette>但我们必须要有些规矩
<4-3,Bernadette>but we got to have some rules.

112
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,860
<4-3,Bernadette>而第一条规矩就是  穿裤子
<4-3,Bernadette>And rule number one is pants.

113
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,650
<4-3,Bernadette>你一定很引你儿子为豪吧
<4-3,Bernadette>You must be very proud of your son.

114
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,040
<5-1,Mrs Cooper>是啊
<5-1,Mrs Cooper>Oh, yes.

115
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,820
<5-2,Dr Hofstadter>他最近在最高法院为一件案子辩护
<5-2,Dr Hofstadter>He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.

116
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,430
<5-3,Mrs Cooper>他去了吗
<5-3,Mrs Cooper>He did?

117
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,600
<5-4,Dr Hofstadter>你是说这个儿子啊
<5-4,Dr Hofstadter>Oh, you mean this son.

118
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,450
<5-4,Dr Hofstadter>是啦  他很不错
<5-4,Dr Hofstadter>Uh, sure, he's terrific.

119
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,060
<5-5,Sheldon>贝弗莉  你想不想看下我为验证我们的假设
<5-5,Sheldon>Uh, Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out

120
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,390
<5-5,Sheldon>所做的计算
<5-5,Sheldon>to support our hypothesis?

121
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,820
<5-6,Leonard>你是说我的假设吗
<5-6,Leonard>Uh, you mean, my hypothesis.

122
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,640
<5-6,Leonard>这全部假设都是我做出来的
<5-6,Leonard>I hypothesized it all by myself.

123
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,590
<5-7,Dr Hofstadter>冷静  亲爱的
<5-7,Dr Hofstadter>Calm down, dear.

124
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,950
<5-7,Dr Hofstadter>玛丽  我很好奇
<5-7,Dr Hofstadter>Mary, I'm curious.

125
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,390
<5-7,Dr Hofstadter>你第一次发现
<5-7,Dr Hofstadter>When did you first realize

126
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,740
<5-7,Dr Hofstadter>你儿子有着如此非凡的脑子是什么时候呢
<5-7,Dr Hofstadter>that your son had such a remarkable mind?

127
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,720
<5-8,Sheldon>好问题
<5-8,Sheldon>Ooh, good question.

128
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,840
<5-8,Sheldon>大家都喜欢天才小子谢尔顿·库珀的故事
<5-8,Sheldon>Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.

129
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,210
<5-9,Mrs Cooper>大概是他十三岁的时候吧
<5-9,Mrs Cooper>Well, I would have to say when he was 13

130
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,250
<5-9,Mrs Cooper>他试着在工具房里造一个核反应堆
<5-9,Mrs Cooper>and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.

131
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,970
<5-10,Sheldon>这是个好故事
<5-10,Sheldon>Ooh, this is a good one.

132
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,450
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>首先  你需要知道的是
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is

133
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,780
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>谢利从小开始
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>ever since he was a little boy,

134
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,160
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>就打从心底为别人着想
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>he was always concerned with the well-being of others.

135
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,520
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>而他觉得要人们付电费
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>And he didn't think that it was fair

136
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,310
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>这事情太不公平了
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>for people to pay for electricity,

137
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,710
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>所以他想要为全镇提供免费电力
<5-11,Mrs Cooper>so he was gonna power the entire town for free.

138
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,130
<5-12,Sheldon>告诉她铀的事
<5-12,Sheldon>Tell her about the uranium!

139
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,360
<5-12,Sheldon>快告诉她铀的事
<5-12,Sheldon>Tell her about the uranium.

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,280
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>好
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>Oh, well!

141
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,210
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>这事还挺好玩的
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>Oh, this is adorable.

142
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,980
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>当他说要从乍得那里弄来黄饼[核反应燃料]时
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad,

143
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,970
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>我还以为他是要从朋友那里
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>I thought he was talking about Twinkies

144
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,330
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>弄个夹馅面包之类的
<5-13,Mrs Cooper>from one of his friends.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,260
<5-14,Sheldon>但其实不是
<5-14,Sheldon>But I wasn't.

146
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,800
<5-14,Sheldon>因为那时我没有任何朋友
<5-14,Sheldon>'Cause I didn't have any friends.

147
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,160
<5-14,Sheldon>没有
<5-14,Sheldon>No.

148
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,860
<5-15,Mrs Cooper>后来才发现这个小混蛋
<5-15,Mrs Cooper>It turns out that this little scallywag was trying

149
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,500
<5-15,Mrs Cooper>是要用我的信用卡
<5-15,Mrs Cooper>to use my Visa card to buy uranium

150
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,870
<5-15,Mrs Cooper>去跟非洲国家"乍得"的军阀买铀
<5-15,Mrs Cooper>from an African warlord in the country of Chad!

151
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,790
<5-16,Dr Hofstadter>听起来谢尔顿小时候是麻烦精啊
<5-16,Dr Hofstadter>Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.

152
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,600
<5-17,Mrs Cooper>是啊  他小时候可麻烦了
<5-17,Mrs Cooper>Oh, he was a handful.

153
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,720
<5-18,Sheldon>我小时候是麻烦精
<5-18,Sheldon>I was a handful.

154
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,500
<5-19,Leonard>现在还是
<5-19,Leonard>You still are.

155
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,910
<5-19,Leonard>妈  告诉玛丽那个
<5-19,Leonard>Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story

156
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,660
<5-19,Leonard>我用家里的吸尘器来做出
<5-19,Leonard>about how I made a Van de Graaff generator

157
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,700
<5-19,Leonard>范德格拉夫起电机的事
<5-19,Leonard>out of our vacuum cleaner.

158
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,070
<5-20,Dr Hofstadter>好啊
<5-20,Dr Hofstadter>All right.

159
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,850
<5-20,Dr Hofstadter>他把吸尘器弄坏了
<5-20,Dr Hofstadter>He broke the vacuum cleaner.

160
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,420
<6-1,Howard>曾有一阵子  全都是吸血鬼
<6-1,Howard>I mean, for a while, everything was vampires.

161
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,980
<6-1,Howard>现在全换成了僵尸了
<6-1,Howard>Now it's all zombies.

162
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,430
<6-1,Howard>真不知道下一个潮流怪物会是什么
<6-1,Howard>I wonder what the next monster fad will be.

163
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,100
<6-2,Raj>貌似有段时间没看过隐形人了
<6-2,Raj>We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.

164
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,840
<6-3,Stuart>显然你是从未看过我跟女人说话
<6-3,Stuart>Clearly, you've never seen me try to talk to a woman.

165
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,410
<6-3,Stuart>先生们
<6-3,Stuart>Guys.

166
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,460
<6-4,Bernadette>在你们坐在这里打电动的时间里
<6-4,Bernadette>In the time you've been sitting here playing video games,

167
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,650
<6-4,Bernadette>我把车开去洗了  买了清洁用品
<6-4,Bernadette>I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies

168
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,200
<6-4,Bernadette>还去了趟银行
<6-4,Bernadette>and went to the bank.

169
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,150
<6-5,Stuart>我把裤子穿上啦
<6-5,Stuart>I put on pants.

170
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,140
<6-6,Howard>马屁精
<6-6,Howard>Kiss-ass.

171
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
<6-7,Bernadette>我不知道我从什么时候开始
<6-7,Bernadette>Okay, I don't know when I became

172
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,080
<6-7,Bernadette>变成了三个懒鬼少年的妈妈
<6-7,Bernadette>the mother to three lazy teenagers,

173
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,170
<6-7,Bernadette>但一切到此为止
<6-7,Bernadette>but it stops today.

174
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,790
<6-7,Bernadette>你们去把厨房打扫了  从上到下里里外外
<6-7,Bernadette>You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.

175
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,380
<6-8,Raj>人家根本不住这里啊
<6-8,Raj>Hey, I don't even live here.

176
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,500
<6-9,Bernadette>那你回答我  我家洗衣房里有没有你的衣服
<6-9,Bernadette>Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?

177
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,880
<6-10,Raj>有
<6-10,Raj>I do.

178
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,360
<6-10,Raj>其中有些是羊毛的
<6-10,Raj>And some of it's wool,

179
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,780
<6-10,Raj>尽量平摊晾干
<6-10,Raj>so dry flat if possible.

180
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,670
<7-1,Sheldon>这张是我拿到学士学位时拍的照片
<7-1,Sheldon>Oh, and here's a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.

181
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,400
<7-2,Dr Hofstadter>你看起来不是很开心啊
<7-2,Dr Hofstadter>You don't look very happy.

182
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,510
<7-3,Sheldon>当时才刚开始进入青春期
<7-3,Sheldon>Well, I had just begun puberty.

183
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,820
<7-3,Sheldon>所以无论从实际或比喻上来说
<7-3,Sheldon>It was figuratively and literally

184
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,490
<7-3,Sheldon>那都是我最"毛"孩子的一段日子
<7-3,Sheldon>one of the hairiest moments of my life.

185
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,830
<7-4,Mrs Cooper>谢利不喜欢改变
<7-4,Mrs Cooper>Shelly does not like change.

186
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,770
<7-5,Sheldon>是的
<7-5,Sheldon>Oh, true.

187
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,000
<7-5,Sheldon>无论你再怎么缩腹
<7-5,Sheldon>But all the clenching in the world will not keep

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,760
<7-5,Sheldon>蛋蛋还是会垂下去[长大]
<7-5,Sheldon>testicles in your abdomen.

189
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,430
<7-6,Penny>抱歉  工作有点耽搁了
<7-6,Penny>Hey, sorry, got caught up at work.

<7-7,Dr Hofstadter>好吧
<7-7,Dr Hofstadter>Oh, okay.

192
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,620
<7-8,Penny>抱歉  我忘了
<7-8,Penny>Sorry, I forgot.

193
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,840
<7-9,Sheldon>还记得我母亲吗
<7-9,Sheldon>You remember my mother.

194
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,180
<7-10,Penny>记得  你好吗  玛丽
<7-10,Penny>Oh, yes. Hi, Mary!

195
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,190
<7-11,Mrs Cooper>亲爱的  很高兴又见到你
<7-11,Mrs Cooper>Good to see you again, dear.

196
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,850
<7-12,Penny>这才是我想要的
<7-12,Penny>Ah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.

197
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,240
<7-13,Leonard>妈  我跟佩妮订婚后你还没见过她呢
<7-13,Leonard>So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged.

198
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,100
<7-14,Penny>对了  给你看看我的戒指
<7-14,Penny>Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.

199
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,480
<7-15,Dr Hofstadter>很漂亮
<7-15,Dr Hofstadter>Oh, lovely.

200
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,260
<7-15,Dr Hofstadter>肯定很贵吧
<7-15,Dr Hofstadter>Must have been very expensive.

201
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,420
<7-16,Sheldon>不  一点都不贵
<7-16,Sheldon>Oh, no, not at all.

202
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,710
<7-16,Sheldon>我们在网上找到一家店
<7-16,Sheldon>No, we, uh, found a place online

203
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,630
<7-16,Sheldon>能将金刚石钻头改成钻石
<7-16,Sheldon>that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.

204
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,180
<7-17,Leonard>才不是呢  他乱说
<7-17,Leonard>We did not. That's not true.

205
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,130
<7-17,Leonard>我能跟你单独谈一下吗
<7-17,Leonard>Can I speak to you alone for a second?

206
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,320
<7-18,Sheldon>当然
<7-18,Sheldon>Oh, sure.

207
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,230
<7-19,Leonard>这是从蒂芬妮买的
<7-19,Leonard>It came from Tiffany's.

208
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,050
<7-20,Sheldon>你说的是盒子对吧
<7-20,Sheldon>You mean the box, right?

209
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,660
<7-21,Leonard>继续走你的
<7-21,Leonard>Keep walking!

210
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,840
<7-22,Penny>我一点都不在乎他在戒指上花了多少钱
<7-22,Penny>Really doesn't matter to me how much he spent on the ring.

211
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,090
<7-22,Penny>大概吧
<7-22,Penny>I think.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,850
<7-23,Sheldon>关于戒指的事我说错话了吗
<7-23,Sheldon>Did I misspeak about the ring?

213
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,300
<7-24,Leonard>是的  那个我们等会再说
<7-24,Leonard>Yes, and we'll get back to that.

214
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,130
<7-24,Leonard>你自己的妈妈就在这儿
<7-24,Leonard>But, uh, even with your mother here,

215
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,010
<7-24,Leonard>你却在故意霸占我妈全部的注意力
<7-24,Leonard>you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom.

216
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,050
<7-24,Leonard>你就像象海豹的幼崽
<7-24,Leonard>You're like one of those elephant seal pups

217
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,830
<7-24,Leonard>从两个妈妈那里抢奶喝
<7-24,Leonard>that steals the milk from two mothers!

218
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,670
<7-25,Sheldon>你指的是海洋生物学家
<7-25,Sheldon>Do you mean what marine biologists

219
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,690
<7-25,Sheldon>所说的"超断人奶机"吧
<7-25,Sheldon>refer to as "super weaning"?

220
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,780
<7-26,Leonard>对  你就是超"机吧"
<7-26,Leonard>Yes, you are a super weaner!

221
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,000
<7-27,Sheldon>这我就要纠正你了
<7-27,Sheldon>Well, now I have to correct you.

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,110
<7-27,Sheldon>作为象海豹的小小爱好者
<7-27,Sheldon>A-As a bit of an elephant seal buff,

223
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,900
<7-27,Sheldon>更准确的比喻
<7-27,Sheldon>the more accurate comparison

224
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,690
<7-27,Sheldon>应该是当两只海豹妈妈
<7-27,Sheldon>would be when two mother seals

225
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,830
<7-27,Sheldon>都抢着给一只海豹幼崽喂奶
<7-27,Sheldon>actively seek to nourish the same pup.

226
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,220
<7-27,Sheldon>所以我觉得你想说的是
<7-27,Sheldon>So I believe the term you're looking for

227
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,910
<7-28,Leonard>双吸母奶婴
<7-28,Leonard>is a double mother suckler.

228
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,840
<7-28,Leonard>你说得没错
<7-28,Leonard>Yeah, you're right.

229
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,520
<7-28,Leonard>我想说的就是这个词
<7-28,Leonard>That is the term I'm looking for.

230
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,990
<7-28,Leonard>你这个肮脏的双吸母奶婴
<7-28,Leonard>You are a dirty double mother suckler!

231
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,190
<7-29,Sheldon>好吧  现在我们找到正确的名词了
<7-29,Sheldon>Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out.

232
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,680
<7-29,Sheldon>你好大的胆子
<7-29,Sheldon>How dare you!

233
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,070
<7-30,Penny>我们不着急
<7-30,Penny>We're not in a rush.

234
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,620
<7-30,Penny>等时机到了再定日子吧
<7-30,Penny>We'll set a date when the time is right.

235
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,080
<7-31,Mrs Cooper>没关系  亲爱的
<7-31,Mrs Cooper>It doesn't matter, sweetie.

236
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,700
<7-31,Mrs Cooper>只要一个男人跟女人上床
<7-31,Mrs Cooper>The moment a man lays with a woman,

237
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,240
<7-31,Mrs Cooper>在上帝眼里他们就已经结婚了
<7-31,Mrs Cooper>they are married in the eyes of the Lord.

238
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,790
<7-33,Mrs Cooper>你对圣经就是这个态度吗
<7-33,Mrs Cooper>The bible is "uch" to you?

239
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,670
<7-34,Dr Hofstadter>不  抱歉  我态度不对
<7-34,Dr Hofstadter>No, I'm sorry. That was inappropriate.

240
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,060
<7-34,Dr Hofstadter>作为一名精神病学家
<7-34,Dr Hofstadter>As a psychiatrist,

241
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,730
<7-34,Dr Hofstadter>我明白迷信对人们的重要性
<7-34,Dr Hofstadter>I know how important people's superstitions can be to them.

242
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,260
<7-35,Mrs Cooper>你想聊迷信吗
<7-35,Mrs Cooper>You want to talk about superstitions?

243
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,180
<7-35,Mrs Cooper>谢尔顿给我看了你写的书
<7-35,Mrs Cooper>Sheldon sent me the books you wrote--

244
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,790
<7-35,Mrs Cooper>全都是关于超我和本我的鬼话
<7-35,Mrs Cooper>all that nonsense about superegos and ids.

245
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,530
<7-35,Mrs Cooper>这都是谁提出的歪理邪说
<7-35,Mrs Cooper>What bull dropped that on the barn floor?

246
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,910
<7-36,Dr Hofstadter>他叫西格蒙德·弗洛伊德
<7-36,Dr Hofstadter>His name is Sigmund Freud.

247
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,090
<7-37,Penny>你们看
<7-37,Penny>Hey, look at that!

248
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,330
<7-37,Penny>你们都相信有胡子的犹太人
<7-37,Penny>You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.

249
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,460
<7-38,Mrs Cooper>别瞎掺和
<7-38,Mrs Cooper>Stay out of this.

250
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,930
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>至少我相信的胡子男
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>At least the bearded man that I believe in

251
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,740
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>传播爱与怜悯
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>preaches love and compassion.

252
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,310
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>而你相信的那个说的都是
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>All yours talks about is

253
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,790
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>为何人们憋着心里的便便
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>why you hold in your poop

254
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,060
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>以及想爬回自己妈妈的肚子里
<7-40,Mrs Cooper>and want to crawl back inside your mama.

255
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,070
<7-41,Dr Hofstadter>真是太精彩了
<7-41,Dr Hofstadter>It's fascinating.

256
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,300
<7-41,Dr Hofstadter>像谢尔顿这么开明的孩子
<7-41,Dr Hofstadter>How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon

257
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,030
<7-41,Dr Hofstadter>怎么会有你这样的母亲
<7-41,Dr Hofstadter>come from someone like you?

258
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,210
<7-42,Mrs Cooper>我知道答案
<7-42,Mrs Cooper>I know the answer.

259
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,210
<7-42,Mrs Cooper>你不会喜欢的
<7-42,Mrs Cooper>You're not gonna like it.

260
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,700
<7-43,Dr Hofstadter>你说啊
<7-43,Dr Hofstadter>Try me.

261
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,760
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>我怀着谢利的时候开车去教堂
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church,

262
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,270
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>向上帝祈祷
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>and I was praying to the Lord

263
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,120
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>给我一个比他那个傻逼老爸聪明的儿子
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy.

264
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,140
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>然后我看到旁边那辆斯巴鲁里的耶稣娃娃
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead

265
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,520
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>冲我点头说好
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>in the Subaru next to me nodding yes.

266
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,790
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>那是什么意思
<7-44,Mrs Cooper>What is that supposed to mean?

267
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,790
<7-45,Dr Hofstadter>意思是
<7-45,Dr Hofstadter>It means...

268
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,860
<7-45,Dr Hofstadter>不敢相信我们居然在聊这个
<7-45,Dr Hofstadter>I can't believe we're having this conversation.

269
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,360
<7-46,Mrs Cooper>多拍几遍吧
<7-46,Mrs Cooper>Well, do it some more.

270
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,800
<7-46,Mrs Cooper>说不定能把你自己拍灵光点
<7-46,Mrs Cooper>Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.

271
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,020
<7-47,Penny>我们还是不要伤害自己了
<7-47,Penny>I hope we all stops hitting ourselves

272
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,560
<7-47,Penny>聊点安全的话题吧
<7-47,Penny>and talk about something safe, you know,

273
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,260
<7-47,Penny>比如鞋子啊  中国婴儿有多萌之类的
<7-47,Penny>like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.

274
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,720
<7-48,Sheldon>或许你妈妈喜欢我比喜欢你多
<7-48,Sheldon>Maybe it is not my fault that your mother likes me

275
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,940
<7-49,Leonard>不是我的错
<7-49,Leonard>better than she likes you!

276
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,720
<7-49,Leonard>少往自己脸上贴金了
<7-49,Leonard>Oh, don't flatter yourself!

277
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,590
<7-49,Leonard>她喜欢任何人都比喜欢我多
<7-49,Leonard>She likes everybody better than she likes me!

278
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,940
<8-1,Raj>这团果冻放了多久了
<8-1,Raj>How old is this Jell-O?

279
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,990
<8-2,Stuart>那是胡萝卜  所以应该很久了
<8-2,Stuart>Well, it's carrots, so gonna say very.

280
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,940
<8-3,Howard>抱歉我们得清理厨房
<8-3,Howard>Sorry we have to do this.

281
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,220
<8-4,Stuart>伯纳黛特没有错
<8-4,Stuart>Bernadette's not wrong.

282
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,940
<8-4,Stuart>她一直都很辛苦
<8-4,Stuart>She does work hard around here.

283
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,980
<8-5,Raj>她不再把你当娃娃一样照顾
<8-5,Raj>Yeah, maybe it's a good thing

284
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,920
<8-5,Raj>也许是一件好事
<8-5,Raj>if she stops babying you so much.

285
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,830
<8-6,Howard>她没有把我当娃娃
<8-6,Howard>She doesn't baby me.

286
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,910
<8-7,Stuart>我看见她用小推车拉你回家
<8-7,Stuart>I saw her pull you home in a wagon.

287
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,780
<8-8,Howard>解释一下
<8-8,Howard>For your information,

288
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,910
<8-8,Howard>我去追冰淇淋车的时候把脚扭了
<8-8,Howard>I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.

289
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,950
<8-9,Raj>面对现实吧
<8-9,Raj>Face it, dude,

290
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,340
<8-9,Raj>伯纳黛特对你就跟你妈对你一样
<8-9,Raj>Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to,

291
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,540
<8-9,Raj>这种关系很不健康
<8-9,Raj>and that was not a healthy relationship.

292
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,300
<8-9,Raj>你说得对
<8-9,Raj>You're right.

293
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,410
<8-10,Howard>我是时候
<8-10,Howard>It's time for me

294
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,930
<8-10,Howard>在婚姻里表现得成熟点了
<8-10,Howard>to act like an adult in this marriage.

295
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,160
<8-10,Howard>履行我做丈夫的职责  从倒垃圾开始
<8-10,Howard>Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash.

296
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,700
<8-10,Howard>妮妮  我闯祸了
<8-10,Howard>Bernie, I made a mess!

297
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,110
<9-1,Dr Hofstadter>非常抱歉惹你母亲不高兴了
<9-1,Dr Hofstadter>I'm terribly sorry that I upset your mother.

298
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,650
<9-2,Sheldon>没事  她会原谅你的
<9-2,Sheldon>Oh, it's all right. She'll forgive you.

299
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,820
<9-2,Sheldon>她必须原谅  否则就得下地狱了
<9-2,Sheldon>She has to or she goes to hell.

300
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,890
<9-3,Dr Hofstadter>我注意到
<9-3,Dr Hofstadter>I can't help but notice

301
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,590
<9-3,Dr Hofstadter>她对你无条件的爱
<9-3,Dr Hofstadter>how her unconditional love for you

302
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,540
<9-3,Dr Hofstadter>与我为人母的教子之方恰恰相反
<9-3,Dr Hofstadter>is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.

303
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,360
<9-4,Sheldon>你将少量关爱
<9-4,Sheldon>Well, you doled out affection

304
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,960
<9-4,Sheldon>作为奖励发放在他们取得成就时
<9-4,Sheldon>as a reward for achievement--

305
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,930
<9-4,Sheldon>这种教子之方已被证实有效
<9-4,Sheldon>a proven way to raise a child.

306
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,820
<9-4,Sheldon>训练老鼠也有效
<9-4,Sheldon>Or train a rat.

307
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,130
<9-5,Dr Hofstadter>看你出落得多么优秀
<9-5,Dr Hofstadter>But look how well you turned out.

308
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,870
<9-6,Sheldon>此刻我本应表现出谦逊  可谁信啊
<9-6,Sheldon>I'd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me?

309
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,970
<9-6,Sheldon>可你也要考虑到
<9-6,Sheldon>Still, you need to consider

310
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,850
<9-8,Sheldon>莱纳德的兄弟姐妹多成功啊
<9-8,Sheldon>how successful Leonard's brother and sister are.

311
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,860
<9-7,Dr Hofstadter>也是
<9-7,Dr Hofstadter>I suppose.

312
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,730
<9-8,Sheldon>而我的兄弟姐妹都是只会用嘴呼吸的笨蛋
<9-8,Sheldon>While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.

313
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,190
<9-9,Dr Hofstadter>你认为如果你成长在一个
<9-9,Dr Hofstadter>Do you suppose you would've flourished more

314
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,750
<9-9,Dr Hofstadter>奖励机制的环境下  会更成功吗
<9-9,Dr Hofstadter>in a reward-based environment?

315
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,370
<9-10,Sheldon>大概吧
<9-10,Sheldon>Perhaps.

316
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,750
<9-10,Sheldon>可只要我想吃
<9-10,Sheldon>But my mom made me spaghetti

317
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,180
<9-10,Sheldon>我妈随时都会给我做热狗肠碎意面
<9-10,Sheldon>with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted,

318
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,520
<9-10,Sheldon>所以随便啦
<9-10,Sheldon>so who cares?

319
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,860
<10-1,Leonard>我妈从来没有在我做自己的情况下
<10-1,Leonard>Not once did my mother ever give me any love

320
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,190
<10-1,Leonard>给我爱或者关怀
<10-1,Leonard>or affection for just being myself;

321
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,420
<10-1,Leonard>我总是得赢得她的爱
<10-1,Leonard>I always had to earn it.

322
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,620
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>莱纳德  我肯定她非常爱你
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>Oh, Leonard, I'm sure she loves you very much.

323
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,450
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>用她冷酷又无神论的方式
<10-2,Mrs Cooper>In her own cold godless way.

324
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,290
<10-3,Penny>我对你的爱你是不用赢得的[挣得]
<10-3,Penny>Yeah, and you certainly don't have to earn my love.

325
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,160
<10-4,Leonard>谢谢
<10-4,Leonard>Thank you.

326
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,380
<10-5,Penny>当然了  这点早在你给我买
<10-5,Penny>Of course, you already knew that

327
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,970
<10-5,Penny>这枚公主型钻头戒时  就悟透了
<10-5,Penny>when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.

328
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,970
<10-6,Leonard>不是那样的
<10-6,Leonard>That's not what it is.

329
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,330
<10-7,Penny>我懂  我懂
<10-7,Penny>I know, I know.

330
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,190
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>等你母亲回来
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>When your mom gets back, I'm gonna need

331
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,320
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>我得为我说话的方式跟她道歉
<10-8,Mrs Cooper>to apologize for the way I spoke to her.

332
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
<10-9,Penny>不用啊  反正也是她先挑的事
<10-9,Penny>Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.

333
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,650
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>不重要  好信徒被打脸会把另一边脸送上
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>Doesn't matter; a good Christian would've turned the other cheek.

334
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,350
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>另一方面
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>On the other hand,

335
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,850
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>好德州人会开枪打死她
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>a good Texan would've shot her, so...

336
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,940
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>我选了个折衷的方式
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>I just kind of split the difference.

337
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,790
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>有人想吃热狗肠碎意面吗
<10-10,Mrs Cooper>Hey, who's in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?

338
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,670
<10-11,Leonard>我想
<10-11,Leonard>Oh, me!

339
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,470
<10-12,Penny>我也想吃
<10-12,Penny>Yeah, me, too!

340
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,640
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>马上开饭
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>Coming up.

341
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,520
<10-14,Leonard>我感觉自己不配吃
<10-14,Leonard>I don't really feel I deserve it.

342
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,700
<11-1,Howard>看来这坨黏糊糊的垃圾
<11-1,Howard>That was a big sticky mess,

343
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,480
<11-1,Howard>已经被我搞定了
<11-1,Howard>but... I think I got it.

344
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,570
<11-2,Raj>看着挺干净
<11-2,Raj>Looks good.

345
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,560
<11-4,Bernadette>瞧瞧
<11-4,Bernadette>Look at that.

346
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,620
<11-4,Bernadette>你自己把垃圾打扫干净了
<11-4,Bernadette>You cleaned it up all by yourself.

347
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,800
<11-5,Howard>是的  你自己把垃圾打扫干净了
<11-5,Howard>Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself.

348
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,750
<11-5,Howard>真是  不懂你没事抱怨个什么...
<11-5,Howard>Honestly, I don't know why you complain so...

349
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,640
<11-5,Howard>可能就那地方没擦干净
<11-5,Howard>Okay, maybe I missed one spot.

350
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
<11-5,Howard>退下吧
<11-5,Howard>Just leave.

351
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,180
<11-5,Howard>很高兴我俩能冰释前嫌
<11-5,Howard>I'm so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.

352
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,010
<12-1,Mrs Cooper>我也是
<12-1,Mrs Cooper>Me, too.

353
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,470
<12-2,Dr Hofstadter>我也尊重你信仰的权利
<12-2,Dr Hofstadter>And I respect your right to your beliefs.

354
