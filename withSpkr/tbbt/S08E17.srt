1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,110
<1-1,Leonard>感觉来了挡都挡不住
<1-1,Leonard>I was unstoppable.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,380
<1-1,Leonard>我是说  我当时整个小宇宙都爆发了
<1-1,Leonard>I mean, I was... I was on fire.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,840
<1-1,Leonard>犹如进入身心合一之境
<1-1,Leonard>It was like my mind and my body were totally connected,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,400
<1-1,Leonard>运动员们在进入状态时  估计就是这感觉
<1-1,Leonard>like-like athletes must feel when they're in the zone.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,170
<1-2,Penny>刚才只是打个迷你高尔夫好吗
<1-2,Penny>Again, it was miniature golf.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,240
<1-3,Leonard>承认被我迷到"性"致盎然了吧
<1-3,Leonard>Admit it, you're a little turned on.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,030
<1-4,Penny>你凭啥这么洋洋得意
<1-4,Penny>You can't be this proud.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:22,850
<1-5,Leonard>为什么不行
<1-5,Leonard>Why not?

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,890
<1-6,Penny>因为你被我虐爆了
<1-6,Penny>Because I beat you.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,560
<1-9,Sheldon>太好了  你们回来了
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, good. You're back.

11

<1-10,Amy>我们有一件令人高兴的事宣布
<1-10,Amy>We have some exciting news.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,090
<1-11,Leonard>好吧
<1-11,Leonard>Okay.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,060
<1-12,Sheldon>你们也知道  我和艾米在一起挺久了
<1-12,Sheldon>As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time,

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,960
<1-12,Sheldon>很多我曾经以为不可能会发生的事
<1-12,Sheldon>and a lot of things I never thought possible

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,530
<1-12,Sheldon>现在看来也很有可能
<1-12,Sheldon>now seem possible.

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,830
<1-11,Leonard>好的
<1-11,Leonard>Okay...

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,190
<1-14,Amy>在谨慎地审视我们这段感情后
<1-14,Amy>After a careful evaluation of our relationship,

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,640
<1-14,Amy>我们觉得现在是时候了
<1-14,Amy>we decided that the time was right to

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,330
<1-14,Amy>我们想迈出下一步
<1-14,Amy>take a step forward.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,440
<1-15,Leonard>好的
<1-15,Leonard>Okay.

21
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,690
<1-16,Sheldon>你想来宣布吗
<1-16,Sheldon>Do you want to say it?

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,880
<1-17,Amy>我们一起宣布吧
<1-17,Amy>Let's say it together.

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,560
<1-18,Together>我们要养只乌龟
<1-18,Together>We're getting a turtle!

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,990
<1-19,Penny>这就是为啥我说要保持有冰镇好的香槟
<1-19,Penny>This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,000
<1-20,Sheldon>-讽刺吗  -是的
<1-20,Sheldon>- Sarcasm? - Yes.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,710
<1-21,Amy>好吧
<1-21,Amy>Okay.

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,680
<1-22,Sheldon>这题挺有难度  因为通常跟酒相关的事
<1-22,Sheldon>That was tricky, 'cause when it comes to alcohol,

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,470
<1-22,Sheldon>她都是说真的  从不开玩笑
<1-22,Sheldon>she generally means business.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,360
<1-23,Leonard>-我们很为你们感到高兴  -是的
<1-23,Leonard>- Well, we're-we're very happy for you. - Yes.

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,380
<1-24,Penny>谢谢
<1-24,Penny>Thank you.

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,430
<1-25,Amy>一起养一只宠物对我们而言是件大事
<1-25,Amy>Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.

32
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,640
<1-26,Sheldon>这是真的
<1-26,Sheldon>No. It's true.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,840
<1-26,Sheldon>这代表我们在乎对方到
<1-26,Sheldon>It means that we care so much about each other,

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,630
<1-26,Sheldon>还能有多余的关爱  分给一只200克的爬行动物
<1-26,Sheldon>there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.

35
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,260
<1-27,Leonard>为什么选乌龟
<1-27,Leonard>Why a turtle?

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,570
<1-28,Sheldon>在一番深思熟虑过后  我们决定乌龟
<1-28,Sheldon>After much deliberation, we've determined that a turtle

37
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,180
<1-28,Sheldon>是最理想的宠物
<1-28,Sheldon>is the ideal pet.

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,240
<1-28,Sheldon>他们不会掉毛  不会发出声音
<1-28,Sheldon>They don't shed fur, they don't make noise...

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,130
<1-29,Amy>万圣节时还能他把打扮成一颗鹅卵石
<1-29,Amy>For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,050
<1-30,Sheldon>如果哪天他发狂  我肯定也跑得比他快
<1-30,Sheldon>And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him.

41
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,540
<1-30,Sheldon>而无独有偶的是  这也是我选你当室友的理由
<1-30,Sheldon>Coincidentally, that's also why I chose you as a roommate.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,020
<1-31,Leonard>恭喜恭喜
<1-31,Leonard>Well, congratulations.

43
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,300
<1-31,Leonard>谁会料到我们这帮人里
<1-31,Leonard>Who would've thought you two would be the first

44
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,730
<1-31,Leonard>你们是第一对有儿女的人呢
<1-31,Leonard>in our group to start a family?

45
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,360
<1-33,Amy>我也这么说
<1-33,Amy>That's what I said!

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,150
<2-1,Raj>你的室友今晚去哪了
<2-1,Raj>So, where's your roommate tonight?

53
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,000
<2-2,Emily>我觉得她总在这里碍事
<2-2,Emily>Well, I thought it was a little unfair

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,160
<2-2,Emily>对你挺不公平
<2-2,Emily>that she's always here,

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,370
<2-2,Emily>因为你从来没有机会在这里过夜  所以...
<2-2,Emily>and you never get a chance to stay over, so...

56
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,280
<2-2,Emily>我把她杀了
<2-2,Emily>I killed her.

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,870
<2-3,Raj>还记得我们的约定吗
<2-3,Raj>But remember our agreement?

58
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,590
<2-3,Raj>你可以开你杀了人的玩笑
<2-3,Raj>You can joke about murdering people,

59
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,110
<2-3,Raj>但是你后面得说"开玩笑的啦"
<2-3,Raj>but you have to say, "just kidding."

60
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,110
<2-4,Emily>而更不该忘的一条重要约定是
<2-4,Emily>And the more important thing to remember is

61
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,600
<2-4,Emily>我永远不会伤害你
<2-4,Emily>that I'd never hurt you.

62
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,580
<2-4,Emily>真倒霉
<2-4,Emily>Oh, crap.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,370
<2-4,Emily>我得赶回医院一趟  察看一个病人
<2-4,Emily>I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.

64
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,130
<2-5,Raj>没关系  我可以晚点再来
<2-5,Raj>That's okay. I can come back later.

65
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,970
<2-6,Emily>不用  别傻了
<2-6,Emily>No. No, don't be silly.

66
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,230
<2-6,Emily>我不会去太久  就在这待着吧
<2-6,Emily>I won't be gone long. Just stay here.

67
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,650
<2-7,Raj>好  没问题
<2-7,Raj>Okay, cool.

68
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,480
<2-7,Raj>你确定我一个人在这待着时
<2-7,Raj>Oh, and you're sure your roommate's not gonna come back

69
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
<2-7,Raj>你的室友不会突然回来吧
<2-7,Raj>while I'm here alone, right?

70
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,910
<2-7,Raj>因为这样会很尴尬
<2-7,Raj>'Cause that'll be awkward.

71
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,590
<2-8,Emily>不用担心  她在棕榈泉
<2-8,Emily>Oh, don't worry. She's in Palm Springs.

72
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,630
<2-9,Raj>那就好
<2-9,Raj>Oh, good.

73
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,060
<2-10,Emily>她的躯干在那里
<2-10,Emily>Well, her torso is.

74
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,430
<2-10,Emily>开玩笑的啦
<2-10,Emily>Just kidding.

75
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,340
<2-10,Emily>我把她扔进碎木机了
<2-10,Emily>I put her in a wood chipper.

76
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,860
<3-1,Sheldon>我的老天  我的老天啊
<3-1,Sheldon>Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.

77
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,100
<3-1,Sheldon>没事的
<3-1,Sheldon>It's okay.

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,900
<3-2,Amy>你撑过去了  没事啦
<3-2,Amy>You made it. We're fine.

79
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,460
<3-3,Sheldon>那也太多小狗了
<3-3,Sheldon>That was a lot of puppies.

80
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,520
<3-4,Amy>别管它们了
<3-4,Amy>Let's forget about them, and...

81
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,780
<3-4,Amy>来给我们选只乌龟吧
<3-4,Amy>pick ourselves out a nice turtle.

82
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,900
<3-4,Amy>你看这只在木头上的怎么样
<3-4,Amy>Oh, how about this one up on the log?

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,400
<3-5,Sheldon>我不知道
<3-5,Sheldon>Oh, I don't know.

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,990
<3-5,Sheldon>他看起来像个混蛋
<3-5,Sheldon>He kind of looks like a jerk.

85
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,180
<3-5,Sheldon>你看这只如何
<3-5,Sheldon>How about this one?

86
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,580
<3-6,Amy>那只不太动  感觉半死不活的
<3-6,Amy>Well, he's barely moving. He looks half dead.

87
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,580
<3-7,Sheldon>对啊  我也喜欢他
<3-7,Sheldon>I know. I like him, too.

88
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,460
<3-7,Sheldon>小家伙
<3-7,Sheldon>Hi, little guy.

89
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,780
<3-7,Sheldon>有兴趣跟我们一起回家吗
<3-7,Sheldon>How'd you like to come home with us?

90
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,470
<3-7,Sheldon>你会跟我一起住
<3-7,Sheldon>You'll be living with me

91
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,830
<3-7,Sheldon>因为我们不住在一个家里
<3-7,Sheldon>because we don't live in the same house.

92
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,200
<3-8,Amy>但这不是你的错
<3-8,Amy>But that's not your fault.

93
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,210
<3-8,Amy>我们像你一样  用超龟速发展这段感情
<3-8,Amy>Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,890
<3-8,Amy>他去动漫展或上班时  你会跟我待在一起
<3-8,Amy>You'll stay with me when he's at Comic-Con or away for work.

95
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,730
<3-9,Sheldon>如果爸比去火星住的申请通过了  你也跟她住
<3-9,Sheldon>Or if they accept Daddy's application to live on Mars.

96
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,360
<3-10,Amy>你在说什么
<3-10,Amy>What are you talking about?

97
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,640
<3-11,Sheldon>有一个公司
<3-11,Sheldon>Oh, there's this company

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,410
<3-11,Sheldon>他们想要在火星上设立一个殖民地
<3-11,Sheldon>that's attempting to establish a colony on Mars,

99
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,690
<3-11,Sheldon>我申请了当第一批移民
<3-11,Sheldon>and I applied to be among the first to go.

100
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,620
<3-11,Sheldon>我们该给他取什么名字呢
<3-11,Sheldon>What should we name him?

101
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,180
<3-11,Sheldon>本来在路上我还打算给他取"塞斯"  可是...
<3-11,Sheldon>You know, I came in thinking "Seth," but...

102
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,810
<3-11,Sheldon>他长得像个意大利人
<3-11,Sheldon>he kind of looks Italian.

103
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,020
<3-12,Amy>你申请要成为
<3-12,Amy>You applied for a mission

104
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,930
<3-12,Amy>另一个行星的移民者
<3-12,Amy>to be a colonist on another planet,

105
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,650
<3-12,Amy>而你都没想过告诉我一声吗
<3-12,Amy>and couldn't be bothered to tell me?

106
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,590
<3-13,Sheldon>事先说你会同意吗
<3-13,Sheldon>Would you have approved?

107
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,210
<3-14,Amy>当然不会
<3-14,Amy>Of course not.

108
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,310
<3-15,Sheldon>从你的反应来看
<3-15,Sheldon>Well, based on your reaction,

109
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,090
<3-15,Sheldon>我做了正确的选择
<3-15,Sheldon>it looks like I made the right choice.

110
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,430
<3-15,Sheldon>对不对呀  朱塞佩[意大利名]
<3-15,Sheldon>Isn't that right, Giuseppe?

111
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,320
<4-1,Leonard>听着  我要跟你坦白件事
<4-1,Leonard>Listen, I-I have a little confession to make.

112
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,900
<4-2,Penny>哎哟  客官第一次吗
<4-2,Penny>Aw, is this your first time?

113

<4-3,Leonard>不是啦  我情人节给你买了份礼物
<4-3,Leonard>No, I got you something for Valentine's Day,

114
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,360
<4-3,Leonard>当时觉得太难为情没敢送给你
<4-3,Leonard>and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.

115
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,740
<4-4,Penny>为什么
<4-4,Penny>Well, why?

116
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,050
<4-5,Leonard>因为我是从"色色"用品店里买的
<4-5,Leonard>Well, 'cause I got it at the dirty store.

117
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,470
<4-6,Penny>你居然去色色用品店不带我
<4-6,Penny>You went to the dirty store without me?!

118
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,710
<4-7,Leonard>我特意戴了墨镜和帽子  还把车停在两条街外
<4-7,Leonard>In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.

119
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,340
<4-8,Penny>拿来  快给我拿来
<4-8,Penny>Well, get it! Get it for me!

<4-11,Leonard>好吧  我希望会好玩
<4-11,Leonard>Okay, uh, well, I hope it's fun.

122
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,690
<4-11,Leonard>因为这玩意配有颜料
<4-11,Leonard>I mean, it-it comes with paints, and-and

123
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,130
<4-11,Leonard>所以富有创造力和艺术性
<4-11,Leonard>it's kind of creative and artistic.

124
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,670
<4-12,Penny>你是去了色色用品店还是"着色"用品店啊
<4-12,Penny>Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?

<4-12,Penny>No, no.

126
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,130
<4-13,Leonard>我们把人体彩绘颜料涂身上
<4-13,Leonard>We cover ourselves in body paint,

127
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,480
<4-13,Leonard>然后在这张大画布上"办事"
<4-13,Leonard>and then-then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.

128
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,250
<4-14,Penny>哇  对于一个最近刚愿意做爱时
<4-14,Penny>Whoa, that's kind of a big step for a guy

129
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,870
<4-14,Penny>把袜子脱掉的男人来说  跨出了很大一步啊
<4-14,Penny>who only recently agreed to take his socks off.

130
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,580
<4-15,Leonard>你在嘲笑我  算了吧
<4-15,Leonard>You're making fun of me. Forget it.

<4-16,Penny>不  来嘛  我想试试
<4-16,Penny>No! No, come on, I want to do it.

<4-18,Penny>and your very, very pale feet make some art.

<4-18,Penny>对了  你下次去那家店的时候  我想跟你一起去
<4-18,Penny>Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.

136
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,080
<4-19,Leonard>好啊  不过有点远
<4-19,Leonard>Okay, but it's a drive--

137
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,390
<4-19,Leonard>我去的那家在圣地亚哥
<4-19,Leonard>the one I went to is in San Diego.

139
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,110
<5-1,Howard>报税弄得怎么样了
<5-1,Howard>How are the taxes going?

140
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,420
<5-1,Howard>还行
<5-1,Howard>Okay.

141
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,370
<5-2,Bernadette>但你在乐高商店消费的发票真多
<5-2,Bernadette>But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.

142
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,830
<5-3,Howard>那些都是业务支出
<5-3,Howard>Those are business expenses.

143
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,900
<5-3,Howard>你可以把那些冲销
<5-3,Howard>You can write those off.

144
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,660
<5-4,Bernadette>价值两百美元的R2-D2机器人也是业务支出吗
<5-4,Bernadette>A $200 R2-D2 is a business expense?

145
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
<5-5,Howard>妮妮
<5-5,Howard>Oh, Bernie,

146
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,090
<5-5,Howard>等我们被税务局审查时  你的语气得比现在
<5-5,Howard>you're gonna have to sound a lot more confident

147
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,110
<5-5,Howard>更自信才行
<5-5,Howard>when we get audited.

148
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,760
<5-5,Howard>怎么了
<5-5,Howard>Hey, what's up?

<5-6,Raj>Eh, Emily ran back to the hospital,

150
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,610
<5-6,Raj>所以我在她家四处转转
<5-6,Raj>so I'm just hanging out at her place.

<5-6,Raj>你呢  你在干什么
<5-6,Raj>What are you, uh, what are you doing?

<5-7,Howard>我在打电动  妮妮在报税
<5-7,Howard>Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.

153
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
<5-8,Raj>你是三岁小孩吗
<5-8,Raj>What are you, a little kid?

154
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,890
<5-8,Raj>你老婆是不是还要帮你把晚餐切成小块呀
<5-8,Raj>Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?

155
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,610
<5-9,Howard>不用啊  我吃果冻软糖就吃饱了
<5-9,Howard>She doesn't have to-- I filled up on jelly beans.

156
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,210
<5-10,Raj>那你在玩什么电动
<5-10,Raj>So, uh, what game are you...

157
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,640
<5-10,Raj>糟糕

158
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,660

159
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,840
<5-12,Raj>我合不上艾米丽的床头柜了
<5-12,Raj>I can't get Emily's nightstand to close.

160
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,820
<5-13,Howard>所以呢
<5-13,Howard>So?

161
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,850
<5-14,Raj>她就会发现我偷翻她的抽屉啊
<5-14,Raj>She's gonna know I was looking in it.

162
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,000
<5-15,Howard>那你为什么要看呢
<5-15,Howard>Why were you looking in it?

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,750
<5-16,Raj>这个问题
<5-16,Raj>Well, there's a question

164
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,480
<5-16,Raj>我最好在她回来之前想好答案
<5-16,Raj>I better have a good answer to before she gets back.

165
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,300
<5-17,Howard>好吧  冷静
<5-17,Howard>Okay, calm down.

166
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,800
<5-17,Howard>很可能抽屉里面有东西卡住了
<5-17,Howard>There's probably something jammed behind it.

167
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,080
<5-17,Howard>你把它拉出来  看看是什么
<5-17,Howard>Just, uh, pull it out and see what's there.

168
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,090
<5-17,Howard>等一下
<5-17,Howard>Hang on.

169
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,540
<5-18,Raj>完了  完了
<5-18,Raj>Oh... no. Oh, no.

<5-18,Raj>这下完蛋了
<5-18,Raj>Oh, God, no!

<5-19,Howard>你听起来很忙  那我就不打扰你啦
<5-19,Howard>You know what, you sound busy-- I'm gonna let you go.

172
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,660
<5-20,Raj>伙计  前面板整个都掉下来了
<5-20,Raj>Dude, the whole front came off.

173
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,610
<5-20,Raj>这下她肯定知道我在偷翻她东西
<5-20,Raj>Now she's gonna know I was snooping.

174
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,760
<5-21,Bernadette>发生什么事了
<5-21,Bernadette>What's happening?

175
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,310
<5-22,Howard>拉杰偷翻艾米丽的抽屉  结果弄坏了一个
<5-22,Howard>Raj was snooping through Emily's drawers and broke one.

176
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,030
<5-23,Bernadette>分手了我会想她的
<5-23,Bernadette>I'm gonna miss her.

177
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,020
<6-1,Penny>你觉得怎么样
<6-1,Penny>So what do you think?

178
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,920
<6-2,Leonard>我还以为会更...
<6-2,Leonard>I thought it'd be a little more...

179
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,890
<6-2,Leonard>多点
<6-2,Leonard>just more.

180
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,290
<6-3,Penny>我都不懂我们为啥喘得上气不接下气
<6-3,Penny>I'm not even sure why we were out of breath.

181
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,830
<6-3,Penny>我是说  我们有移动过一丁点吗
<6-3,Penny>Uh, I mean, d-did we move at all?

182
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,170
<6-4,Leonard>可能有顺着Z轴移动
<6-4,Leonard>Maybe along the z-axis,

183
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,440
<6-4,Leonard>但X轴和Y轴看了让人想落泪
<6-4,Leonard>but x and y are looking pretty sad.

184
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,160
<6-5,Penny>拜托  我们不是又老又无趣的人
<6-5,Penny>Okay, come on. We are not old boring people.

185
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,940
<6-5,Penny>我们可以"做"得比这更好
<6-5,Penny>We can do better than this.

186
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,610
<6-6,Leonard>你说得对
<6-6,Leonard>Uh, th-that's true.

187
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,820
<6-6,Leonard>昨晚我们熬夜到几点
<6-6,Leonard>How late did we stay up last night?

188
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,220
<6-7,Penny>将近凌晨一点吧
<6-7,Penny>Almost 1:00 a.M.

189
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,790
<6-8,Leonard>太对了  将近凌晨一点呢
<6-8,Leonard>Damn straight, almost 1:00 a.M.

190
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,470
<6-8,Leonard>而且我们不是在看电视
<6-8,Leonard>And we weren't even watching TV.

191
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,710
<6-8,Leonard>我们看的是视频网站  就像小年轻那样
<6-8,Leonard>We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.

192
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,860
<6-9,Penny>是啊  看的是喜剧还是普通电视剧
<6-9,Penny>Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama?

193
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,700
<6-9,Penny>谁知道啊
<6-9,Penny>Nobody knows.

194
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,790
<6-9,Penny>来吧  我们要卷土重"做"
<6-9,Penny>Now, come on. We are gonna do this.

195
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,490
<6-10,Leonard>好的  你去拿颜料
<6-10,Leonard>Yeah. You get the paint,

196
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,910
<6-10,Leonard>我休息个30到40分钟
<6-10,Leonard>I'll rest for 30-40 minutes,

197
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,160
<6-10,Leonard>然后我们大"干"一场
<6-10,Leonard>and then we do this!

198
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,780
<7-1,Sheldon>真不敢相信你差点就让我把
<7-1,Sheldon>I can't believe you almost had me bring

199
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,420
<7-1,Sheldon>一只野动物带回家
<7-1,Sheldon>a wild animal into my home.

200
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,950
<7-2,Amy>没人让你去戳乌龟的脸
<7-2,Amy>No one told you to poke the turtle's face.

201
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,720
<7-3,Sheldon>我跟它玩"偷走你的鼻子"游戏
<7-3,Sheldon>I was playing "Got Your Nose."

202
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,500
<7-3,Sheldon>通常想让小孩喜欢你就这么玩
<7-3,Sheldon>That's how you get children to like you.

203
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,380
<7-4,Amy>我很惊讶你居然会在乎他会不会喜欢你
<7-4,Amy>I'm surprised you even care if he likes you,

204
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,370
<7-4,Amy>因为只要机会来了  你第一时间就会离开这星球
<7-4,Amy>since you're planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.

205
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,390
<7-5,Sheldon>又来了
<7-5,Sheldon>Ugh, this again.

206
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,000
<7-5,Sheldon>艾米  我的身体今天已经被咬了一个洞了
<7-5,Sheldon>Amy, I've already had one new hole torn in my body today.

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,700
<7-5,Sheldon>心上不需要再多一个
<7-5,Sheldon>I don't need another one.

208
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,800
<7-6,Amy>谢尔顿  我知道
<7-6,Amy>Sheldon, I know the odds of you

209
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,920
<7-6,Amy>你去火星的几率非常渺茫
<7-6,Amy>even going to Mars are incredibly small,

210
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,040
<7-6,Amy>但是一想到你自愿申请会永远离开我的项目
<7-6,Amy>but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something

211
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,130
<7-6,Amy>我还是觉得很难过
<7-6,Amy>that would take you away from me forever.

212
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,900
<7-7,Sheldon>所以你是说如果你有机会
<7-7,Sheldon>So you're saying you wouldn't leave me

213
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,780
<7-7,Sheldon>成为移民另一个星球的第一批人类
<7-7,Sheldon>for the chance to be one of the first humans

214
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,780
<7-7,Sheldon>你也不会离开我吗
<7-7,Sheldon>to colonize another planet?

215
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,440
<7-8,Amy>我至少会在提交申请前
<7-8,Amy>I would at least mention it

216
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,650
<7-8,Amy>跟你提一下这个事
<7-8,Amy>before filling out the application.

217
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,560
<7-9,Sheldon>莱纳德  沃罗威茨   库萨帕里
<7-9,Sheldon>Huh, that's exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali,

218
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,100
<7-9,Sheldon>博纳黛特和佩妮也是这么说的
<7-9,Sheldon>Bernadette and Penny said.

219
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,480
<7-10,Amy>再说了  你怎么可能胜任
<7-10,Amy>And who says you could even survive

220
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,110
<7-10,Amy>这种太空任务呀
<7-10,Amy>an interplanetary mission, anyway?

221
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,530
<7-10,Amy>你被乌龟咬一下都差点挂了
<7-10,Amy>You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.

222
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,630
<7-11,Sheldon>首先  这个伤口
<7-11,Sheldon>First of all, this...

223
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,800
<7-11,Sheldon>只会让我变得更坚强
<7-11,Sheldon>has only made me stronger.

224
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,160
<7-11,Sheldon>再说了  我只不过
<7-11,Sheldon>But beyond that, all I did

225
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,330
<7-11,Sheldon>提交了申请而已
<7-11,Sheldon>was fill out an application.

226
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,690
<7-12,Amy>我受够了
<7-12,Amy>You know what?

227
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,210
<7-12,Amy>滚去火星吧  谢尔顿
<7-12,Amy>Go to Mars, Sheldon.

228
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,450
<7-13,Sheldon>我能做点什么让你不生气吗
<7-13,Sheldon>Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

229
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,060
<7-14,Amy>不能  别白费力气了
<7-14,Amy>No. Forget it.

230
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,350
<7-15,Sheldon>我用鼻子哼哼《星际迷航》主题曲呢
<7-15,Sheldon>What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?

231
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,940
<7-16,Amy>求求你别这么做
<7-16,Amy>Please don't.

232
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,290
<7-17,Sheldon>哇  你真的生气了
<7-17,Sheldon>Yep, you're mad.

233
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,670
<8-1,Howard>让我看看损坏的程度
<8-1,Howard>Okay, let me see the damage.

234
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,930
<8-2,Raj>等一下
<8-2,Raj>Hang on.

235
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,760
<8-3,Howard>你可能把暗榫弄坏了
<8-3,Howard>Well, I think you broke the dowels.

236
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,140
<8-3,Howard>你没有时间把它粘回去了
<8-3,Howard>You're not gonna have time to glue it back on--

237
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,580
<8-3,Howard>只能用钉子钉上
<8-3,Howard>you'll have to nail it.

238
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,470
<8-4,Raj>用什么钉啊
<8-4,Raj>With what?

239
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,740
<8-5,Howard>她那里有枕头或者酒杯吗
<8-5,Howard>Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?

240
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,920
<8-6,Raj>有耶
<8-6,Raj>She does.

241
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,640
<8-7,Howard>太好了
<8-7,Howard>Great.

242
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,770
<8-7,Howard>这两样都没用  去找把锤子
<8-7,Howard>Neither of those. Try a hammer!

243
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,310
<8-8,Raj>玩我你爽了吗
<8-8,Raj>Did that feel good?

244
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,720
<8-8,Raj>你觉得自己棒棒哒了吗
<8-8,Raj>You feel like a big man now?

245
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,900
<9-1,Sheldon>我本想帮你泡杯红花茶
<9-1,Sheldon>I was going to make you red zinger,

246
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,510
<9-1,Sheldon>但鉴于火星也是红色的星球
<9-1,Sheldon>but since Mars is the red planet,

247
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,010
<9-1,Sheldon>我还是给你泡薄荷茶吧
<9-1,Sheldon>I went with peppermint.

248
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,910
<9-2,Amy>你到底为什么想参加这个项目呢
<9-2,Amy>Why do you even want to do this?

249
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,370
<9-2,Amy>其实呢

<9-3,Sheldon>你想看看吗
<9-3,Sheldon>You want to see it?

254
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,970
<9-4,Amy>你就不能直接告诉我吗
<9-4,Amy>Can't you just tell me?

255
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,020
<9-5,Sheldon>但是人家录了短片的呀
<9-5,Sheldon>But I made a video.

256
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,530
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>在下是谢尔顿·库珀博士
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

257
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,490
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>我要告诉你们为什么应该选我...
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to...

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,210
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>我聪明绝顶
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>I'm exceedingly smart.

260

<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>Penicillin can't take this away.

264
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,280
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>在狭小的空间里  保持清洁至关重要
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important

265
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,450
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>而我的卫生习惯无懈可击
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>and... my hygiene is impeccable.

266
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,660
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>动物都无法信任我
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>In fact, animals don't trust me

267
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,810
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>因为我身上什么味都没有
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>because I smell like nothing.

268
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,780
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>真的
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>Yeah...

269

<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>我可以用我独特的幽默感保持士气
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humor.

272
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,440

<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>Hey, Leonard...

273
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,760
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>那个罐子里还有花生糖吗
<9-6,Sheldon (on video)>is there any peanut brittle left in that can?

274
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,670
<9-7,Leonard (on video)>你是指这个超级可疑的罐子吗
<9-7,Leonard (on video)>You mean this weirdly suspicious one?

275
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,400
<9-8,Sheldon (on video)>是的  打开看看嘛
<9-8,Sheldon (on video)>Yes. Open it and check.

276
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
<9-8,Sheldon (on video)>我不明白了
<9-8,Sheldon (on video)>I don't get it.

277
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,390
<9-9,Leonard (on video)>这里面真的有花生糖...
<9-9,Leonard (on video)>There's actually peanut brittle in...

278
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,180
<9-9,Leonard (on video)>求求你去火星好吗
<9-9,Leonard (on video)>Please go to Mars.

279
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,270
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>言归正传
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>But on a more serious note:

280
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,760
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>我想去火星的最大原因是
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>The most important reason I want to go to Mars is that

281
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,520
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>我坚信  身为一位科学家
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>I believe, as a scientist,

282
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,160
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>突破人类认知的极限是我的天职
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>it's my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward.

283
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,350
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>我知道火星上的生活将无比艰难
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult.

284
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,110
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>但地球上的日子也不像野餐那么好玩
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>But life here on Earth is no picnic.

285
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,180
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>当然  野餐本身也不好玩
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>Also, picnics are no picnic.

286
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,220
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>我们该去哪里吃午餐
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>Where should we go for lunch?

287
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,710
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>我知道  去地上吃吧
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>Oh, I know, the ground.

288
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,730
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>总而言之
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>In conclusion,

289
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,360
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>多谢你们观看我为
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>thank you for considering me

290
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,810
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>这段千载难逢的旅行录制的申请
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>for this journey of a lifetime.

291
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,120
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>上火星
<9-10,Sheldon (on video)>To Mars!

292
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,690
<9-11,Sheldon>后来  莱纳德从他的鼻子里
<9-11,Sheldon>Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose,

293
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,230
<9-11,Sheldon>擤出了派呢
<9-11,Sheldon>and pie came out.

294
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,020
<10-1,Leonard>就是那里  就是那里
<10-1,Leonard>Right there, right there,

295
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,840
<10-1,Leonard>天啊  终于啊
<10-1,Leonard>Oh, God, that's it!

296
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,720
<10-2,Penny>你是怎么把颜料弄到眼睛里
<10-2,Penny>How did you get paint in your eye?

297
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,720
<10-3,Leonard>都是因为你不让我戴防护眼镜
<10-3,Leonard>Because you wouldn't let me wear safety goggles!

298
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,880
<10-3,Leonard>看上去一团糟啊
<10-3,Leonard>This looks terrible.

299
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,090
<10-3,Leonard>她肯定会发现
<10-3,Leonard>She-she's gonna know.

300
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,900
<11-1,Raj>没关系
<11-1,Raj>It's fine.

301
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,660
<11-2,Howard>你就差两个钉而已了
<11-2,Howard>You just need two more nails.

302
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,600
<11-3,Raj>好的  应该钉在哪里
<11-3,Raj>Okay, where should I put them?

303
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,790
<11-4,Howard>钉在艾米丽的眼睛里
<11-4,Howard>In Emily's eyes.

304
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,630
<11-5,Raj>你真是帮倒忙
<11-5,Raj>You're not helping.

305
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,730
<11-6,Bernadette>所以这就是你偷翻人东西的报应
<11-6,Bernadette>Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.

306
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,810
<11-7,Raj>我要处理这一摊事就已经够烦了...
<11-7,Raj>You know, it-it's bad enough that I have to deal with this...

307
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,530
<11-8,Emily>拉杰  我回来了
<11-8,Emily>Raj? I'm back.

308
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,480
<5-18,Raj>死了
<5-18,Raj>Oh, no.

309
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,140
<11-10,Emily>医院情况还好吗
<11-10,Emily>How was the hospital?

310
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,670
<11-11,Raj>很好
<11-11,Raj>Fine.

311
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,630
<11-12,Emily>你在里面干什么呢
<11-12,Emily>What were you doing in there?

312
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,250
<11-13,Raj>那个...我...
<11-13,Raj>Uh... w-well...

313
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,200
<11-13,Raj>我不想对你撒谎
<11-13,Raj>Okay, look, I-I don't want to lie to you.

314
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,680
<11-13,Raj>我很好奇  于是我到处看了看
<11-13,Raj>I-I got curious, I was looking around...

315
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,640
<11-13,Raj>然后我就弄坏了你的床头柜抽屉
<11-13,Raj>and I broke the drawer on your night stand.

316
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,560
<11-14,Emily>你翻看了我的床头柜抽屉吗
<11-14,Emily>You were looking in my night stand?

317
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,660
<11-15,Raj>是的
<11-15,Raj>Yeah.

318
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,540
<11-16,Emily>所以我第一次让你单独留在家里
<11-16,Emily>So, the first time I leave you alone,

319
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,380
<11-16,Emily>你就开始到处偷翻
<11-16,Emily>you snoop on me?

320
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
<11-17,Raj>你从来没偷翻过我的公寓吗
<11-17,Raj>You've never snooped around my apartment?

321
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,450
<11-18,Emily>没有
<11-18,Emily>No!

322
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,170
<11-19,Raj>快  好好想想
<11-19,Raj>Come on, think back.

323
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,540
<11-19,Raj>你要是有过前科会很有帮助哟
<11-19,Raj>It would really help if you had!

324
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,190
<11-20,Emily>真没想到你这么不相信我
<11-20,Emily>I can't believe you don't trust me!

325
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,040
<11-21,Bernadette>她听起来很火大啊
<11-21,Bernadette>She sounds really mad.

326
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,970
<11-22,Howard>我们应该挂掉
<11-22,Howard>We should hang up.

327
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,030
<11-23,Bernadette>对  是应该
<11-23,Bernadette>Yeah, we should.

328
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,540
<11-24,Howard>但我们不会这么做  对不对
<11-24,Howard>But we're not going to, are we?

329
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,670
<11-25,Bernadette>门都没有
<11-25,Bernadette>Not a chance.

330
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,770
<11-26,Howard>不是说"偷翻是不对的"吗
<11-26,Howard>What happened to "snooping is wrong"?

331
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,570
<11-27,Bernadette>反正你本来就要因为税收欺诈去坐牢了
<11-27,Bernadette>Howard, you're going to jail for tax fraud.

332
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,090
<11-27,Bernadette>这有啥所谓
<11-27,Bernadette>Who cares?

333
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,280
<12-1,Leonard>我们"做"到了
<12-1,Leonard>Well, we did it.

334
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,950
<12-2,Penny>确实"做"到了
<12-2,Penny>We sure did.

335
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,840
<12-3,Leonard>我整个小宇宙都爆发了
<12-3,Leonard>I mean, I was on fire!

336
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,310
<12-3,Leonard>我超在状态  像运动员一样
<12-3,Leonard>I-I was in the zone, like an athlete.

337
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,160
<12-4,Penny>亲爱的  这次你也是被我虐爆了
<12-4,Penny>Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.

338
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,180
<12-5,Leonard>那我们把它挂哪儿
<12-5,Leonard>So, where do we want to hang it?

339
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,330
<12-6,Penny>什么  你开什么玩笑
<12-6,Penny>What? Are you kidding?

340
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,730
<12-8,Penny>才不要挂起来
<12-8,Penny>We're not hanging it!

341
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,640
<12-7,Leonard>但这是我们爱情的展示
<12-7,Leonard>But it's an expression of our love.

342
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,820
<12-8,Penny>也是我们的屁股  不挂
<12-8,Penny>And our butts! Not hanging it!

343
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,970
<12-9,Leonard>扔了怪可惜的
<12-9,Leonard>Seems a shame to throw it away.

344
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,220
<12-9,Leonard>是啊
<12-9,Leonard>Yeah.

345
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,570
<12-10,Penny>我们可以送给谢尔顿
<12-10,Penny>We could give it to Sheldon,

346
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,050
<12-10,Penny>告诉他是威廉·夏特纳画的
<12-10,Penny>and tell him William Shatner painted it.

348
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,600
<12-11,Leonard>天  我爱你  我爱死你了
<12-11,Leonard>God, I love you. I love you so much.

349
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,260
<13-1,Amy>我要回家了
<13-1,Amy>I think I'm gonna go home.

350
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,160
<13-1,Amy>为什么
<13-1,Amy>Why?

351
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,690
<13-2,Sheldon>我真不理解这是什么情况
<13-2,Sheldon>I really don't understand what's happening here.

352
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,460
<13-3,Amy>谢尔顿  如果是任何其他时候
<13-3,Amy>You know, Sheldon, at any other time,

353
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,690
<13-3,Amy>知道你计划要去火星上住
<13-3,Amy>learning that you had plans to go live on Mars

354
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,800
<13-3,Amy>那这事只是你太晚告诉我而已
<13-3,Amy>would be a slow news day.

355
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,280
<13-3,Amy>但几个小时前
<13-3,Amy>But a couple of hours ago,

356
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,230
<13-3,Amy>我们还要一起养乌龟
<13-3,Amy>we were getting a turtle.

357
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,720
<13-3,Amy>虽然说起来有点傻
<13-3,Amy>And silly as it sounds,

358
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,560
<13-3,Amy>但我以为那代表着什么
<13-3,Amy>I thought that meant something.

359
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,320
<13-4,Sheldon>艾米
<13-4,Sheldon>Amy!

360
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,170
<13-4,Sheldon>我为什么没给她喝睡觉觉茶

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,460
<13-9,Amy>我们是在同一星球上吗
<13-9,Amy>are we on the same planet?

370
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,630
<13-8,Sheldon>因为我也看过远距离异地恋成功的例子
<13-8,Sheldon>Yeah, because I've seen people make the long-distance thing work.

371
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,830
<13-9,Amy>我们是在同一星球上

383
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,300

398
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,130
