1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,980
<1-1,Leonard>不  你想  液态金属终结者
<1-1,Leonard>No, see, the liquid-metal terminators were created

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,640
<1-1,Leonard>是天网系统在未来世界创造的角色
<1-1,Leonard>In the future by skynet,

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,510
<1-1,Leonard>而天网系统是由麦尔斯·戴森开发的
<1-1,Leonard>And skynet was developed by miles dyson,

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,180
<1-1,Leonard>但这样的未来不会存在了
<1-1,Leonard>But that future no longer exists

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,610
<1-1,Leonard>因为戴森已经在终结者2里死了
<1-1,Leonard>Due to dyson's death in terminator 2.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,990
<1-1,Leonard>好吧  但你这样想
<1-1,Leonard>Okay,read only this.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,060
<1-2,Sheldon>假设所有正义的终结者一开始
<1-2,Sheldon>Assuming all the good terminators

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,140
<1-2,Sheldon>由天网系统创造时都是邪恶的
<1-2,Sheldon>Were originally evil terminators created by skynet

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,110
<1-2,Sheldon>是后来经约翰·康纳之手才重新改编了其程序
<1-2,Sheldon>But then reprogrammed by the future john connor,

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,210
<1-2,Sheldon>那为什么天网系统  如此一个人工智能
<1-2,Sheldon>Why would skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,130
<1-2,Sheldon>会去创造一个火辣的17岁小矮个机器人杀手?
<1-2,Sheldon>Bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,110
<1-3,Leonard>因为天网系统变态?
<1-3,Leonard>Skynet is kinky?

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,520
<1-3,Leonard>我不知道
<1-3,Leonard>I don't know...

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,890
<1-4,Sheldon>人工智能可不会把小屁孩当恋物
<1-4,Sheldon>Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,680
<1-5,Leonard>好吧  等等  其实他们是想用它...
<1-5,Leonard>All right. Wait! they use it to...

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,610
<1-6,Sheldon>太晚了  我赢了
<1-6,Sheldon>Too late. I win.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,800
<1-8,Leonard>这究竟是什么玩意?
<1-8,Leonard>What the hell is that?

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,620
<1-9,Sheldon>我不知道  但如果猫可以唱歌
<1-9,Sheldon>I don't know, but if cats could sing...

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,010
<1-9,Sheldon>它们也会受不了这个
<1-9,Sheldon>They'd hate it, too.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,990
<1-10,Penny (still singing off)>好啊  伙计们
<1-10,Penny (still singing off)>Hey, guys!

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,480
<1-10,Penny (still singing off)>你们去哪儿?
<1-10,Penny (still singing off)>Hi! where you going?

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,470
<1-10,Penny (still singing off)>什么
<1-10,Penny (still singing off)>What?

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,370
<1-11,Leonard>我们出去寄些信  还有...
<1-11,Leonard>We just had to mail some letters and...

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,660
<1-11,Leonard>顺便把这些鸡肉扔了
<1-11,Leonard>Throw away some chicken.

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,310
<1-12,Penny>你们肯定猜不到刚才发生了什么
<1-12,Penny>You'll never guess what just happened.

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,340
<1-13,Leonard>我猜不到
<1-13,Leonard>Oh, I give up.

27
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,340
<1-13,Leonard>我根本不用猜
<1-13,Leonard>I don't guess.

28
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,880
<1-14,Sheldon>作为一名科学家  我们通过
<1-14,Sheldon>As a scientist, I reach conclusions

29
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,470
<1-14,Sheldon>观察和试验来得出结论...
<1-14,Sheldon>Based on observation and experimentation...

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,910
<1-14,Sheldon>虽然我现在正这么说
<1-14,Sheldon>Although as I'm saying this,

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,840
<1-14,Sheldon>但我感觉你可能已经使用了
<1-14,Sheldon>It occurs to me you may have been employing

32
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,610
<1-14,Sheldon>某种能带修辞的表达装置来使我的回应倍受争议
<1-14,Sheldon>A rhetorical device rendering my response moot.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,610
<1-15,Penny>那是什么东西?
<1-15,Penny>What was that?

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,810
<1-16,Leonard>你信不信  他现在开窍了
<1-16,Leonard>Believe it or not, personal growth.

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,870
<1-16,Leonard>是什么事?
<1-16,Leonard>What happened?

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,580
<1-17,Penny>是这样  记不记得我曾经参加了
<1-17,Penny>All right, remember when I auditioned for that workshop

37
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,200
<1-17,Penny>出租产品展示会的试镜却没通过
<1-17,Penny>Production of rent, but I didn't get it

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,340
<1-17,Penny>并且我没想通是什么原因?
<1-17,Penny>And I couldn't figure out why.

39
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,440
<1-18,Sheldon>通过观察我得出了一点结论
<1-18,Sheldon>I have a conclusion based on an observation.

40
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,640
<1-19,Leonard>不  你没有
<1-19,Leonard>No, you don't.

41
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,440
<1-19,Leonard>不  他没有
<1-19,Leonard>No, he doesn't.

42
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,120
<1-20,Penny>他们选中的那个女孩
<1-20,Penny>Well, the girl they picked to play mimi--

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,200
<1-20,Penny>她退出了  然后他们让我替代她
<1-20,Penny>She dropped out, and they asked me to replace her.

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,230
<1-21,Leonard>恭喜你  这是个契机啊
<1-21,Leonard>Congratulations. what a lucky break.

45
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,140
<1-22,Penny>没什么大不了的  就一晚上的亮相
<1-22,Penny>It's not that big a deal, just a one-night showcase,

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,480
<1-22,Penny>但他们请了好多剧组人员和经纪人来
<1-22,Penny>But they invite a lot of casting people and agents.

47
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,580
<1-22,Penny>去了才知道啦...
<1-22,Penny>So, you never know.

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,460
<1-23,Sheldon>-我想我知道  -不  你不知道
<1-23,Sheldon>I think I know. no, you don't.

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,640
<1-24,Leonard>他不知道
<1-24,Leonard>He doesn't.

50
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,610
<1-25,Penny>这周五晚8点  你们想不想来?
<1-25,Penny>It's this friday night at 8:00. you guys want to come?

<1-26,Together>No. no.

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,310
<1-27,Leonard>因为...
<1-27,Leonard>Because... uh...

53
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,540
<1-27,Leonard>周五我们要参加一个
<1-27,Leonard>Friday we are attending a symposium

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,210
<1-27,Leonard>关于分子正负的研讨会
<1-27,Leonard>On molecular positronium.

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,810
<1-28,Sheldon>我以为是下周二6点呢
<1-28,Sheldon>I think that's a week from tuesday,at 6:00.

<1-30,Penny>太遗憾了
<1-30,Penny>Oh, too bad.

59

<1-30,Penny>-再见了  伙计们  -再见
<1-30,Penny>See you guys. see ya.

61
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,480
<1-32,Sheldon>你刚才对潘妮撒了谎
<1-32,Sheldon>You just lied to penny.

62
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,240
<1-33,Leonard>-是  我撒了谎  -而且你表现得
<1-33,Leonard>Yes, I did. and you did it

63
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,710
<1-34,Sheldon>如此从容  没有呼吸急促
<1-34,Sheldon>So casually-- no rapid breathing,

64
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,550
<1-34,Sheldon>也没有冒汗
<1-34,Sheldon>No increase in perspiration...

65
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,580
<1-35,Leonard>所以说?
<1-35,Leonard>So?

66
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,510
<1-36,Sheldon>所以说  你撒谎时缺乏生理反应
<1-36,Sheldon>So, lack of a physiological response while lying

67
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,400
<1-36,Sheldon>这是反社会暴力狂的特点
<1-36,Sheldon>Is characteristic of a violent sociopath.

68
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,650
<1-37,Leonard>谢尔顿  你是在担心你的人身安全吗
<1-37,Leonard>Sheldon, are you worried about your safety?

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,720
<1-38,Sheldon>不  我想如果你要杀了我
<1-38,Sheldon>No, I imagine if you were going to kill me,

70
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,680
<1-38,Sheldon>你早就下手了
<1-38,Sheldon>You'd have done it a long time ago.

71
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,350
<1-39,Leonard>说得非常正确
<1-39,Leonard>That's very true.

76
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,630
<1-39,Leonard>天才也性感  第一季  第10集
<1-39,Leonard>The Big Bang Theory S01E10

77
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,650
<1-39,Leonard>里奥纳德

78
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,850
<1-39,Leonard>里奥纳德
<1-39,Leonard>Leonard?

79
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,180
<3-1,Sheldon>-里奥纳德  -干嘛
<3-1,Sheldon>Leonard? what?

80
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,780
<2-3,Sheldon>我得找你谈谈
<2-3,Sheldon>I need to speak to you.

81
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,490
<2-4,Leonard>现在是凌晨2点
<2-4,Leonard>It's 2:00 in the morning!

82
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,490
<2-5,Sheldon>很重要的事
<2-5,Sheldon>It's important.

83
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,120
<2-6,Leonard>我严重怀疑
<2-6,Leonard>I highly doubt that.

84
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,820
<2-6,Leonard>走开
<2-6,Leonard>Go away.

85
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,760
<2-6,Leonard>你还在外面吗
<2-6,Leonard>Are you still out there?

86
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,380
<2-7,Sheldon>没错
<2-7,Sheldon>Yes.

87
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,510
<2-8,Leonard (opening door)>干嘛
<2-8,Leonard (opening door)>What?

88
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,810
<2-9,Sheldon>你说的对  我们还是天亮了再说吧
<2-9,Sheldon>You're right; it can wait until morning.

89
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,210
<2-10,Leonard (following Sheldon into living room)>什么  什么  什么  什么  什么
<2-10,Leonard (following Sheldon into living room)>What, what, what, what, what?

90
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,580
<2-11,Sheldon>没事儿
<2-11,Sheldon>Never mind.

91
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,280
<2-11,Sheldon>很明显我在你熟睡的时候叫醒了你
<2-11,Sheldon>I clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle.

92
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,910
<2-11,Sheldon>你根本就没心情听我说话
<2-11,Sheldon>You're in no state of mind to talk.

93
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,900
<2-12,Leonard>谢尔顿  到底什么事
<2-12,Leonard>Sheldon, what is it?

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,910
<2-13,Sheldon>卷入了你对潘妮的欺骗事件我感到很不舒服
<2-13,Sheldon>I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny.

95
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,710
<2-14,Leonard>那我应该怎么说
<2-14,Leonard>What was I supposed to say?

96
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,080
<2-15,Sheldon>你可以跟她说实话
<2-15,Sheldon>You could have told her the truth.

97
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,110
<2-16,Leonard>那样会伤害她的
<2-16,Leonard>That would have hurt her feelings.

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,180
<2-17,Sheldon>这跟伤害她有什么关系?
<2-17,Sheldon>Is that a relevant factor?

99
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,580
<2-18,Leonard>当然有
<2-18,Leonard>Yes.

100
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,810
<2-19,Sheldon>那我想你应该答应她去的
<2-19,Sheldon>Then I suppose you could've agreed to go.

101
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,430
<2-20,Leonard>那我之后该怎么说?
<2-20,Leonard>And what would I have said afterwards?

102
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,620
<2-21,Sheldon>我会这么说
<2-21,Sheldon>I would suggest something to be a fact of

103
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,850
<2-21,Sheldon>唱歌对你来说既不是一个合适的职业
<2-21,Sheldon>Singing is neither an appropriate vocation

104
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,310
<2-21,Sheldon>也不是合适的副业  如果你不同意
<2-21,Sheldon>Nor avocation for you, and if you disagree,

105
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,800
<2-21,Sheldon>我建议你去做一个X光断层扫描
<2-21,Sheldon>I'd recommend you have a cat scan

106
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,880
<2-21,Sheldon>看看是不是有肿瘤
<2-21,Sheldon>To look for a tumor pressing

107
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,630
<2-21,Sheldon>压迫到了你大脑的认知处理单元
<2-21,Sheldon>On the cognitive processing centers of your brain.

108
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,670
<2-21,Sheldon>我可说不出来
<2-21,Sheldon>I couldn't say that.

109
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,610
<2-22,Leonard>我只会说  你真的太棒了
<2-22,Leonard>I would have to say, "you were terrific

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,110
<2-22,Leonard>我好想再听一遍你的歌声
<2-22,Leonard>And I can't wait to hear you sing again."

111
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,450
<2-23,Sheldon>为什么
<2-23,Sheldon>Why?

112
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,560
<2-24,Leonard>这是人们交际的法则
<2-24,Leonard>That's the social protocol.

113
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,880
<2-24,Leonard>当你朋友对自己很烂的东西引以为傲时
<2-24,Leonard>It's what you do when you have a friend

114
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,040
<2-24,Leonard>你就应该这么做
<2-24,Leonard>Who's proud of something they really suck at.

115
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,750
<2-25,Sheldon>我以前不知道
<2-25,Sheldon>I was not aware of that.

116
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,380
<2-26,Leonard>那你现在知道了
<2-26,Leonard>Well, now you are. oh.

117
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,110
<2-27,Sheldon>好吧  里奥纳德
<2-27,Sheldon>All right. leonard?

118
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,000
<2-28,Leonard>怎么
<2-28,Leonard>Yes?

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,490
<2-29,Sheldon>记得我们以前玩国际象棋吗
<2-29,Sheldon>When we played chess earlier,

120
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,000
<2-29,Sheldon>你真的太棒了  我真想能有机会再跟你切磋
<2-29,Sheldon>You were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,540
<2-29,Sheldon>晚安
<2-29,Sheldon>Good night.

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,830
<3-1,Sheldon>里奥纳德
<3-1,Sheldon>Leonard?

123
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,970
<3-1,Sheldon>里奥纳德
<3-1,Sheldon>Leonard?

124
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,110
<3-1,Sheldon>里奥纳德
<3-1,Sheldon>Leonard?

125
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,050
<3-2,Leonard>如果我真是反社会暴力狂
<3-2,Leonard>This would be so much easier

126
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,310
<3-2,Leonard>那就好办多了
<3-2,Leonard>If I were a violent sociopath.

127
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,780
<3-1,Sheldon>里奥纳德  里奥纳德

128
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,250
<3-2,Leonard>怎么了
<3-2,Leonard>What?

129
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,210
<3-3,Sheldon>我刚才分析了下我们的谎话  我在想
<3-3,Sheldon>I was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger

130
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
<3-3,Sheldon>潘妮要是看穿了我们的骗局  我们就危险了
<3-3,Sheldon>Of penny seeing through the ruse.

131
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,680
<3-4,Leonard>怎么会
<3-4,Leonard>How?

132
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,380
<3-5,Sheldon>很简单  如果她登陆
<3-5,Sheldon>Simple, If she were to log onto

138
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,450
<3-5,Sheldon>我们就要火烧屁股了
<3-5,Sheldon>Our pants are metaphorically on fire.

139
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,880
<3-6,Sheldon>好吧  先生  我今天不会让火烧到我屁股的
<3-6,Sheldon>Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.

140
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,950
<4-1,Sheldon>潘妮
<4-1,Sheldon>Penny?

141
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,150

143
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,070
<4-1,Sheldon>早上好
<4-1,Sheldon>Good morning.

144
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,950
<4-2,Penny>你知不知道现在几点?
<4-2,Penny>Do you have any idea what time it is?

145
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,120
<4-3,Sheldon>我当然知道
<4-3,Sheldon>Of course I do.

146
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,680
<4-3,Sheldon>我的手表连接着科罗拉多州的
<4-3,Sheldon>My watch is linked to the atomic clock

147
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,980
<4-3,Sheldon>波尔得的原子钟
<4-3,Sheldon>In boulder, colorado.

148
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,250
<4-3,Sheldon>精确到0.1秒
<4-3,Sheldon>It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

149
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,580
<4-3,Sheldon>但我在这说话的同时  再一次
<4-3,Sheldon>But as I'm saying this, it occurs to me

150
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,480
<4-3,Sheldon>我感觉你的问题可能是带修辞性的
<4-3,Sheldon>That, once again, your question may have been rhetorical.

151
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,110
<4-4,Penny>你要干什么
<4-4,Penny>What do you want?

152
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,380
<4-5,Sheldon>还记得里奥纳德怎么跟你说
<4-5,Sheldon>Remember how leonard told you

153
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,650
<4-5,Sheldon>为什么我们不能去看你表演吗
<4-5,Sheldon>We couldn't come to your performance

154
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,480
<4-5,Sheldon>因为我们要参加研讨会
<4-5,Sheldon>Because we were attending a symposium

155
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,350
<4-5,Sheldon>关于分子正负的
<4-5,Sheldon>On molecular positronium?

156
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,750
<4-6,Penny>我记得有个研讨会
<4-6,Penny>I remember "symposium."

157
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,710
<4-7,Sheldon>是的  那是他骗你的
<4-7,Sheldon>Yes. well... he lied.

158
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,910
<4-8,Penny>等等
<4-8,Penny>Wait.

159
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
<4-6,Penny>什么
<4-6,Penny>What?

160
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,980
<4-7,Sheldon>他跟你撒谎了
<4-7,Sheldon>He lied

161
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,410
<4-9,Sheldon>我对此感到很忐忑不安
<4-9,Sheldon>And I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.

162
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,650
<4-10,Penny>知道我是什么感觉吗
<4-10,Penny>Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

163
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,890
<4-11,Sheldon>饿?
<4-11,Sheldon>Hungry?

164
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,740
<4-11,Sheldon>累?
<4-11,Sheldon>Tired?

165
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,400
<4-11,Sheldon>对不起  这真的不是我的强项
<4-11,Sheldon>I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.

166
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,920
<5-1,Leonard>你告诉他我骗她?
<5-1,Leonard>You told her I lied?

167
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,780
<5-1,Leonard>你为什么要告诉她我骗她?
<5-1,Leonard>Why would you tell her I lied?

168
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,860
<5-2,Sheldon>为了帮你
<5-2,Sheldon>To help you.

169
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,860
<5-3,Leonard>不好意思  我没看到哪里有帮助
<5-3,Leonard>I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

170
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,350
<5-4,Sheldon>她最终肯定会看穿你的谎言
<5-4,Sheldon>She was going to see through your lie eventually,

171
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,470
<5-4,Sheldon>所以  为了保护我  我告诉她你撒了谎
<5-4,Sheldon>So I told her that you were lying to protect me.

172
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,560
<5-5,Leonard>我有种不好的感觉
<5-5,Leonard>Ohh... I'm getting a bad feeling.

173
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,410
<5-6,Sheldon>饿了?
<5-6,Sheldon>Hunger?

174
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,560
<5-6,Sheldon>消化不良?
<5-6,Sheldon>Indigestion?

175
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,130
<5-6,Sheldon>对不起  我真的不擅长这个
<5-6,Sheldon>I'm sorry, I'm really not very good at this.

176
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,100
<5-6,Sheldon>总之
<5-6,Sheldon>Anyway,

177
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,180
<5-6,Sheldon>潘妮现在已经相信
<5-6,Sheldon>Penny now believes that, on friday night,

178
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,480
<5-6,Sheldon>周五的晚上我们要去参加
<5-6,Sheldon>We're going to participate

179
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,590
<5-6,Sheldon>我表弟里奥珀德的戒毒调停会
<5-6,Sheldon>In my cousin leopold's drug intervention.

180
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,710
<5-7,Leonard>你的表弟里奥珀德
<5-7,Leonard>Your cousin leopold.

181
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,910
<5-8,Sheldon>大部分人叫他里奥  但你叫他里他也会答应
<5-8,Sheldon>Who most people call leo, but he also answers to lee.

182
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,480
<5-8,Sheldon>记住这点  这很关键
<5-8,Sheldon>Remember that. it's important.

183
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,000
<5-9,Leonard>有什么好关键的?
<5-9,Leonard>What's important?

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,650
<5-10,Sheldon>细节  里奥纳德
<5-10,Sheldon>Details, leonard-- the success

185
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,310
<5-10,Sheldon>骗人的成功或失败
<5-10,Sheldon>Or failure of our deceitful enterprise

186
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,340
<5-10,Sheldon>就是取决于细节
<5-10,Sheldon>Turns on details.

187
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,280
<5-11,Leonard>-你真有个表弟叫里奥珀德?  -没有
<5-11,Leonard>Do you have a cousin leopold? no.

188
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,580
<5-12,Sheldon>他是我捏造的
<5-12,Sheldon>I made him up.

189
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,210
<5-12,Sheldon>我觉得你应该叫他里
<5-12,Sheldon>I think you'd call him lee.

190
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,380
<5-13,Leonard>我不明白了
<5-13,Leonard>I don't get it.

191
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,910
<5-13,Leonard>我已经跟她撒过一次谎了
<5-13,Leonard>I already told her a lie.

192
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,750
<5-13,Leonard>为什么要再撒一个不同的谎?
<5-13,Leonard>Why replace it with a different lie?

193
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,080
<5-14,Sheldon>首先  你的谎话很可笑且容易被识破
<5-14,Sheldon>Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent,

194
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,510
<5-14,Sheldon>而我的却十分缜密且难以识破
<5-14,Sheldon>Where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

195
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,830
<5-14,Sheldon>在你睡觉的时候
<5-14,Sheldon>While you were sleeping,

196
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,320
<5-14,Sheldon>我组建了一个"非不可解释"网站
<5-14,Sheldon>I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

197
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,860
<5-15,Leonard>非不可解释?
<5-15,Leonard>Un-unravelable?

198
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,810
<5-15,Leonard>是的
<5-15,Leonard>Yes.

199
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,680
<5-16,Sheldon>如果她在google里搜索"里奥珀德·休斯顿"
<5-16,Sheldon>If she googles "leopold houston,"

200
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,070
<5-16,Sheldon>她会找到一个facebook(美国交友网站)页面
<5-16,Sheldon>She'll find a facebook page,

201
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,410
<5-16,Sheldon>一个在线博客  里面有描述他吸毒走向堕落的过程
<5-16,Sheldon>An online blog depicting his descent into drug use

202
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,350
<5-16,Sheldon>而且在eharmony.com(美国婚介网站)有个绝望但仍有希望的名单
<5-16,Sheldon>And a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmony.com.

203
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,080
<5-17,Leonard>好吧  但是为什么
<5-17,Leonard>Okay, why would I go

204
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,310
<5-17,Leonard>我要去参加你表弟的戒毒调停会
<5-17,Leonard>To a drug intervention for your cousin?

205
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,550
<5-18,Sheldon>因为那在长滩  而我又不会开车
<5-18,Sheldon>Ah! because it's in long beach, and I don't drive.

206
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,180
<5-19,Leonard>我们要去长滩?
<5-19,Leonard>We're going to long beach?

207
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,850
<5-20,Sheldon>不  当然不  根本就没有表弟里奥
<5-20,Sheldon>No, of course not. there's no cousin leo.

208
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,050
<5-20,Sheldon>也没有调停会
<5-20,Sheldon>There's no intervention.

209
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,350
<5-20,Sheldon>动动脑子  里奥纳德
<5-20,Sheldon>Focus, leonard.

210
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,380
<5-21,Leonard>不会吧
<5-21,Leonard>Aw, come on.

211
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,270
<5-22,Sheldon>我们只需要在周五晚上离开家
<5-22,Sheldon>We just leave the house on friday night and we return

212
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,330
<5-22,Sheldon>然后等到凌晨再回来
<5-22,Sheldon>In the wee hours, emotionally wrung out,

213
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,350
<5-22,Sheldon>带着一幅坚信里奥回戒毒所后能改邪归正的表情
<5-22,Sheldon>From the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab.

214
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,380
<5-23,Leonard>他还要回戒毒所?
<5-23,Leonard>He goes back into rehab?

215
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,010
<5-24,Sheldon>没错  并且  要是潘妮再邀请我们听她唱歌
<5-24,Sheldon>Yes, but, he can relapse if penny

216
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,150
<5-24,Sheldon>他随时可以毒瘾发作的
<5-24,Sheldon>Ever invites us to hear her sing again.

217
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,810
<5-25,Leonard>你毕竟还是告诉她我撒谎了
<5-25,Leonard>You still told her I lied.

218
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,580
<5-26,Sheldon>但初衷很高尚的  你是为了帮助我
<5-26,Sheldon>For a noble purpose-- to spare me

219
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,710
<5-26,Sheldon>避免让人知道我有个吸毒的弟弟
<5-26,Sheldon>The social embarrassment

220
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,980
<5-26,Sheldon>这一让人尴尬的事情
<5-26,Sheldon>Of having a drug-addled first cousin--

221
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,480
<5-26,Sheldon>我假设这是很尴尬  对吗
<5-26,Sheldon>Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?

222
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,350
<5-27,Leonard>我怎么可能记住这么多乱七八糟的
<5-27,Leonard>How am I supposed to remember all of this?

223
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,950
<5-28,Sheldon>最精彩的部分到了  你根本不用去记
<5-28,Sheldon>Oh, that's the best part. you don't have to.

224
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,910
<5-28,Sheldon>我对潘妮说如果你发现
<5-28,Sheldon>See, I told penny that you would be embarrassed

225
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,150
<5-28,Sheldon>她知道你骗她的话  你会很尴尬
<5-28,Sheldon>If you knew that she found out that you had lied,

226
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,550
<5-28,Sheldon>所以  她同意装作像上个谎话
<5-28,Sheldon>So she's agreed to operate

227
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,350
<5-28,Sheldon>还没被拆穿一样  装作什么都不知道
<5-28,Sheldon>As if the original lie is still in force.

228
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,210
<5-29,Leonard>所以她以为我是撒谎
<5-29,Leonard>So she's expecting me to lie about going

229
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,550
<5-29,Leonard>说去帕萨迪纳市开研讨会
<5-29,Leonard>To a symposium in pasadena,

230
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,350
<5-29,Leonard>而实际上  我们假装正要去
<5-29,Leonard>When, in actuality, we're pretending

231
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,680
<5-29,Leonard>长滩参加你弟弟的戒毒调停会
<5-29,Leonard>To go to a drug intervention in long beach.

232
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,780
<5-29,Leonard>非不可解释
<5-29,Leonard>Un-unravelable.

233
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,150
<6-1,Leonard (opening door)>潘妮
<6-1,Leonard (opening door)>Oh, hey, penny.

234
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,690
<6-1,Leonard (opening door)>你看看你  都整装待发准备好演出了
<6-1,Leonard (opening door)>Wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase.

235
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,290
<6-1,Leonard (opening door)>-你看上去真漂亮  -谢谢
<6-1,Leonard (opening door)>You look great. thanks.

236
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,760
<6-2,Penny>我只是想过来看看并且祝你们好运
<6-2,Penny>I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck

237
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,620
<6-2,Penny>关于你们的...研讨会
<6-2,Penny>With your... symposium.

238
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,380
<6-3,Leonard>谢谢你
<6-3,Leonard>Well, thank you.

239
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,960
<6-4,Penny>我必须要跟你说  很多人都会
<6-4,Penny>You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends

240
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,380
<6-4,Penny>让他们的朋友孤零零一个人
<6-4,Penny>Would let their friend go alone,

241
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,480
<6-4,Penny>但你不是这样的人
<6-4,Penny>But that's not who you are.

242
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,460
<6-4,Penny>你是那种总陪在朋友身边的人
<6-4,Penny>You are the kind of guy who stands by a friend

243
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,580
<6-4,Penny>即使当他有个...研讨会要去参加
<6-4,Penny>When... when he has a symposium to go to.

244
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,710
<6-5,Leonard>我不知道怎么说
<6-5,Leonard>I don't know what to say.

245
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,660
<6-6,Penny>没事的  里奥纳德
<6-6,Penny>It's okay, leonard.

246
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,700
<6-7,Leonard>哦  好的  不错
<6-7,Leonard>Oh, okay, all right, good.

247
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,490
<6-8,Howard (arriving)>伙计  大家一起来抱抱
<6-8,Howard (arriving)>Oh, boy, group hug. uh-uh.

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,290
<6-9,Penny>好吧
<6-9,Penny>Okay.

249
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,560
<6-10,Howard>怎么了?
<6-10,Howard>So, what's up?

250
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,680
<6-12,Howard>潘妮正要去一个
<6-12,Howard>Well, penny is on her way to perform

251
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,930
<6-13,Sheldon>出租用品展示会进行表演
<6-13,Sheldon>In a one-night showcase production of rent,

252
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,990
<6-13,Sheldon>而我们不能去了  因为我们要去参加
<6-13,Sheldon>Which we are unable to attend, because we're going

253
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,790
<6-13,Sheldon>由伊米尔·法尔曼法尔米安博士主讲的
<6-13,Sheldon>To a symposium on molecular positronium

254
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,590
<6-13,Sheldon>关于分子正负的研讨会
<6-13,Sheldon>Given by dr. emil farmanfarmian.

255
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,550
<6-14,Howard>等等  法尔曼法尔米安要来
<6-14,Howard>Wait a minute-- farmanfarmian is speaking

256
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,620
<6-14,Howard>而你们竟然霸占这个研讨会?
<6-14,Howard>And you're bogarting the symposium?

257
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,520
<6-15,Leonard>霍华德  对不...我们...
<6-15,Leonard>Howard, I'm sorr... we-we...

258
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,040
<6-16,Howard>不  不  你们保密到连夸克都透不过
<6-16,Howard>No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

259
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,930
<6-18,Howard>我不知道怎么说
<6-18,Howard>I don't know what to say.

260
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,690
<6-19,Leonard>-霍华德  听着...  -不  没关系
<6-19,Leonard>Howard, listen... no, it's okay.

261
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
<6-20,Howard>那是你的命根子
<6-20,Howard>It's your millennium falcon.

262
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,010
<6-20,Howard>你可以跟楚巴卡(体型高大、身披毛发的战士)得到任何你们想要的
<6-20,Howard>You and chewbacca do whatever you want to do.

263
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,790
<6-20,Howard>我跟莱娅公主(星战人物)
<6-20,Howard>Me and princess leia here

264
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,060
<6-20,Howard>会找点别的事来度过今晚
<6-20,Howard>Will find some other way to spend the evening.

265
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,220
<6-21,Penny>霍华德  等等
<6-21,Penny>Howard, wait. wai...

266
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,290
<6-21,Penny>谢尔顿  我觉得我们得告诉他们
<6-21,Penny>Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

267
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,860
<6-22,Sheldon>好吧  当然可以
<6-22,Sheldon>Okay, sure.

268
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,360
<6-22,Sheldon>我觉得没有任何问题
<6-22,Sheldon>I don't see a problem with that.

269
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,020
<6-23,Penny>根本就没有什么研讨会
<6-23,Penny>There's no symposium.

270
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,690
<6-23,Penny>里奥纳德跟我撒了谎  是不是  里奥纳德?
<6-23,Penny>Leonard lied to me. isn't that right, leonard?

271
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,980
<6-24,Leonard>我不知道怎么说
<6-24,Leonard>I don't know what to say!

272
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,310
<6-25,Penny>没关系  我来说
<6-25,Penny>It's okay; I do.

273
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,890
<6-25,Penny>里奥纳德其实在帮谢尔顿解决家庭危机
<6-25,Penny>Look, leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis.

274
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,390
<6-25,Penny>他编了整个什么研讨会的故事
<6-25,Penny>He made up the whole story about the symposium

275
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,540
<6-25,Penny>什么法尔曼...法尔米安...博士
<6-25,Penny>With dr. farman... farmian...

276
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,300
<6-26,Sheldon>你真强
<6-26,Sheldon>Good for you.

277
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,220
<6-27,Penny>因为他不想让谢尔顿尴尬
<6-27,Penny>...because he didn't want sheldon to be embarrassed.

278
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,260
<6-27,Penny>其实这根本没什么可尴尬的  知道吗
<6-27,Penny>And there is nothing to be embarrassed about, okay?

279
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,720
<6-27,Penny>在美国谁家都会有个亲戚
<6-27,Penny>Every family in america has a relative

280
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,920
<6-27,Penny>干点不大光彩的事情
<6-27,Penny>Holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.

281
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,530
<6-28,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)>不  我也糊涂了
<6-28,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)>No, I'm lost, too.

282
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,520
<6-28,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)>我觉得她跳过了一步
<6-28,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)>I think she skipped a step.

283
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,890
<6-29,Penny>不是  你们听我说
<6-29,Penny>No, look.

284
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,140
<6-29,Penny>谢尔顿的表弟里奥逃离了戒毒所
<6-29,Penny>Sheldon's cousin leo escaped rehab,

285
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,730
<6-29,Penny>他现在躲在长滩的一家汽车旅馆
<6-29,Penny>And he's in a motel 8 in long beach.

286
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,990
<6-29,Penny>他们全家出动参加调停会
<6-29,Penny>The whole family's going out for an intervention.

287
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,720
<6-29,Penny>里奥纳德要开车送谢尔顿去
<6-29,Penny>Leonard is driving sheldon down there

288
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,560
<6-29,Penny>帮他表弟渡过难关  因为他真的是个好人哦
<6-29,Penny>To help him through this, because he's such a good man.

289
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,020
<6-30,Leonard>又抱我一次?  谢谢
<6-30,Leonard>Oh, another hug? thank you.

290
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,790
<6-31,Penny>好了  朋友们  祝你们好运
<6-31,Penny>All right, you guys, good luck.

291
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,890
<6-32,Leonard>谢谢  潘妮
<6-32,Leonard>Thanks, penny.

292
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,090
<6-34,Sheldon>祝你演出成功
<6-34,Sheldon>Oh-- break a leg.

293
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,190
<6-34,Sheldon>演出成功
<6-34,Sheldon>Break a leg.

294
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,890
<6-35,Howard>开车去长滩
<6-35,Howard>So, road trip to long beach.

295
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,660
<6-36,Leonard>不  我们不去长滩
<6-36,Leonard>No. we're not going to long beach.

296
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,340
<6-37,Raj>为什么
<6-37,Raj>Why not?

297
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,890
<6-38,Leonard>因为谢尔顿根本就没有一个
<6-38,Leonard>Because sheldon doesn't have

298
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,520
<6-38,Leonard>吸毒的叫里奥珀德的表弟
<6-38,Leonard>A drug-addicted cousin leopold.

299
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,560
<6-39,Raj>太遗憾了
<6-39,Raj>Oh, too bad.

300
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,010
<6-39,Raj>我一直都想去长滩
<6-39,Raj>I've always wanted to go to long beach.

301
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,720
<6-40,Sheldon>的确是个不错的地方
<6-40,Sheldon>It's a very nice community.

302
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,360
<6-40,Sheldon>玛丽女王号就停靠在那里
<6-40,Sheldon>The queen mary is docked there.

303
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,440
<6-40,Sheldon>它曾是世上最大的远洋客轮
<6-40,Sheldon>Once the largest ocean liner in the world,

304
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,740
<6-40,Sheldon>现在成了一家酒店和餐厅
<6-40,Sheldon>It's now a hotel and restaurant,

305
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,560
<6-40,Sheldon>为顾客提供极其扣人心弦的
<6-40,Sheldon>Where they host a surprisingly gripping

306
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,460
<6-40,Sheldon>离奇谋杀主题晚宴
<6-40,Sheldon>Murder mystery dinner.

307
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,720
<6-41,Raj>听起来挺有趣  我要去
<6-41,Raj>Sounds fun. I'm game.

308
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,720
<6-43,Raj>出发!
<6-43,Raj>Shotgun!

309
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,790
<6-43,Raj>别  别  别
<6-43,Raj>No, no, no.

310
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,260
<6-44,Sheldon>里奥纳德要坐前排  否则他会恶心呕吐
<6-44,Sheldon>Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front,

311
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,690
<6-44,Sheldon>不过即便这样  也很难保证
<6-44,Sheldon>And even then, it's iffy.

312
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,460
<6-45,Leonard>等等  我们...真要去长滩啊?!
<6-45,Leonard>Wait, are we... really going to long beach?!

313
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,720
<6-45,Leonard>里奥纳德
<6-45,Leonard>Leonard?

314
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,560
<7-1,Sheldon>里奥纳德  里奥纳德
<7-1,Sheldon>Leonard? leonard?

315
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,160
<7-2,Leonard>别再想了  谢尔顿
<7-2,Leonard>Let it go, sheldon.

316
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,410
<7-2,Leonard>不管你觉得说不说得通
<7-2,Leonard>The murderer was the first mate

317
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,960
<7-2,Leonard>谋杀犯就是第一个同事
<7-2,Leonard>Whether it makes sense to you or not.

318
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,820
<7-3,Sheldon>不是  我才不关心那个呢
<7-3,Sheldon>No, that's the least of our worries.

319
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,120
<7-3,Sheldon>我一直在做一些关于吸毒方面的研究...
<7-3,Sheldon>I've been doing some research on addiction--

320
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,360
<7-3,Sheldon>既有生物化学方面的也有行为方面的...
<7-3,Sheldon>Both the biochemical and behavioral aspects--

321
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,430
<7-3,Sheldon>我觉得我们现在这个
<7-3,Sheldon>And I think there's a problem

322
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,470
<7-3,Sheldon>版本的谎话有个问题
<7-3,Sheldon>With the current version of our lie.

323
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,640
<7-4,Leonard>你说什么呢
<7-4,Leonard>What are you talking about?

324
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,290
<7-4,Leonard>无所谓了  她相信了  都结束了
<7-4,Leonard>It's fine-- she bought it; it's over.

325
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,800
<7-5,Sheldon>可惜的是  并没有
<7-5,Sheldon>Sadly, it's not.

326
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,840
<7-5,Sheldon>对抗毒品不是一朝一夕的事
<7-5,Sheldon>Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle,

327
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,890
<7-5,Sheldon>抛开这点  我意识到我所描述的这个里奥
<7-5,Sheldon>But beyond that, I have realized that the leo I described

328
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
<7-5,Sheldon>根本就不会同意到戒毒所接受治疗
<7-5,Sheldon>Would not have agreed to go to rehab.

329
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,290
<7-6,Leonard>为什么
<7-6,Leonard>Why not?

330
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,260
<7-7,Sheldon>因为里奥是中间儿(美国有"中间儿综合症"这一说法)
<7-7,Sheldon>Because leo's a middle child.

331
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,060
<7-8,Leonard>根本就没里奥这个人!
<7-8,Leonard>There is no leo!

332
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
<7-8,Leonard>你怎么就能说这些?
<7-8,Leonard>How can you say that?

333
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,540
<7-9,Sheldon>你没读过他的简历  是吗
<7-9,Sheldon>You didn't read the bio, did you?

334
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,640
<7-9,Sheldon>他不仅是个中间儿
<7-9,Sheldon>He's not just a middle child,

335
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,280
<7-9,Sheldon>他更是个典型的中间儿...
<7-9,Sheldon>He is the quintessential middle child--

336
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,820
<7-9,Sheldon>附:他出自破碎家庭
<7-9,Sheldon>From a broken home, to boot.

337
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,290
<7-9,Sheldon>从心理学上讲  即使会导致自我毁灭
<7-9,Sheldon>Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling,

338
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,220
<7-9,Sheldon>对他来说  通过反抗所获得的关注度
<7-9,Sheldon>Even to the point of self-destruction,

339
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,790
<7-9,Sheldon>在情感上的价值要远远超过康复治疗所带来的效果
<7-9,Sheldon>Is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.

340
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,260
<7-10,Leonard>我倒有个主意
<7-10,Leonard>I've got a solution.

341
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,160
<7-11,Sheldon>太好了  什么
<7-11,Sheldon>Great. what is it?

342
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,690
<7-12,Leonard>出  去!
<7-12,Leonard>Get out!

343
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,590
<7-12,Leonard>好吧
<7-12,Leonard>Fine.

344
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,180
<7-13,Sheldon>我一直犹豫要不要说
<7-13,Sheldon>I've hesitated to point this out,

345
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,960
<7-13,Sheldon>但我必须提醒你的是
<7-13,Sheldon>But I must now remind you that we

346
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,890
<7-13,Sheldon>我们目前的窘境完全是因为你先前
<7-13,Sheldon>Are in our current predicament because of your initial

347
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
<7-13,Sheldon>理由相当不充分的欺骗行为造成的
<7-13,Sheldon>And totally inadequate deceit.

348
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,720
<7-13,Sheldon>我只是想替你收拾残局而已
<7-13,Sheldon>I'm just trying to clean up after your mess.

349
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,440
<7-13,Sheldon>我们明早再说
<7-13,Sheldon>We'll talk in the morning.

350
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,640
<8-1,Strange man>早
<8-1,Strange man>Morning.

351
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,100
<8-2,Leonard>你是谁
<8-2,Leonard>Who are you?

352
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,950
<8-3,Man>我是谢尔顿的表弟里奥
<8-3,Man>I am sheldon's cousin leo.

353
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,960
<8-4,Leonard>谢尔顿根本没有一个叫里奥的表弟
<8-4,Leonard>Sheldon does not have a cousin leo.

354
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,810
<8-5,Man>恰恰相反
<8-5,Man>Au contraire.

355
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,370
<8-5,Man>我今年26岁
<8-5,Man>I'm 26 years old.

356
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,060
<8-5,Man>我的祖籍是...德克萨斯州的登顿市
<8-5,Man>I'm originally from... denton, texas,

357
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,060
<8-5,Man>但我是个海军顽童  所以我从小
<8-5,Man>But I was a navy brat, so I was

358
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,420
<8-5,Man>是在世界各地的军事基地长大的
<8-5,Man>Brought up on a variety of military bases around the world.

359
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,110
<8-5,Man>因此  我总感觉跟群体格格不入...
<8-5,Man>As a result, I've often felt like an outsider--

360
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,490
<8-5,Man>从没真正融入过
<8-5,Man>Never really fitting in,

361
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,860
<8-5,Man>这也很可能是我滥用毒品的原因
<8-5,Man>Which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.

362
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,290
<8-6,Sheldon>打扰一下  我们刚才还练习过一遍
<8-6,Sheldon>Excuse me, we just went over this.

363
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,830
<8-6,Sheldon>作为一个典型的中间儿  你的赌瘾
<8-6,Sheldon>As the quintessential middle child, your addiction

364
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,160
<8-6,Sheldon>根植于你未被满足的对关注度的需求当中
<8-6,Sheldon>Is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

365
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,260
<8-7,Man>谢尔顿  我们不是真的要用通俗心理学吧?
<8-7,Man>Oh, sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology?

366
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,860
<8-8,Sheldon>请注意  这些都是以有力的研究为根据的
<8-8,Sheldon>For your information, this is all based on solid research.

367
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,560
<8-8,Sheldon>完全依照我写给你的性格档案就行了
<8-8,Sheldon>Just stick with the character profile I wrote for you.

368
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,860
<8-9,Leonard>-谢尔顿?  -不好意思
<8-9,Leonard>Sheldon? I'm sorry.

369
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,300
<8-10,Sheldon>里奥纳德  这位是托比·鲁本菲尔德
<8-10,Sheldon>Leonard, this is toby loobenfeld.

370
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,630
<8-10,Sheldon>他是粒子物理实验室的
<8-10,Sheldon>He's a research assistant

371
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,060
<8-10,Sheldon>一名研究助理
<8-10,Sheldon>In the particle physics lab,

372
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,450
<8-10,Sheldon>不过他同时在麻省理工辅修戏剧
<8-10,Sheldon>But he also minored in theater at mit.

373
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,620
<8-11,Toby>事实上  说双学位更准确些
<8-11,Toby>It was more of a double major, actually.

374
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,930
<8-11,Toby>戏剧和物理
<8-11,Toby>Theater and physics.

375
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,920
<8-11,Toby>可以猜一下哪门是我中产阶级的父母
<8-11,Toby>You can guess which one my bourgeois parents

376
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
<8-11,Toby>逼我学的
<8-11,Toby>Pushed me toward.

377
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,120
<8-12,Leonard>行了  我知道了
<8-12,Leonard>Yeah, I got it.

378
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,220
<8-12,Leonard>谢尔顿...你这是为什么
<8-12,Leonard>Sheldon... why?

379
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,120
<8-13,Sheldon>你想啊  鉴于里奥不会去接受康复治疗
<8-13,Sheldon>You see, while leo would not have gone into rehab,

380
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,020
<8-13,Sheldon>那我们把他从汽车旅馆劝回家
<8-13,Sheldon>It is completely plauible that we would have talked him

381
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,860
<8-13,Sheldon>就是完全可以解释通的了
<8-13,Sheldon>Into leaving the motel and coming home with us.

382
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,020
<8-15,Toby>谢尔顿  这样设计
<8-15,Toby>Oh... sheldon, how about this

383
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,190
<8-15,Toby>我的动机如何...我14岁那年
<8-15,Toby>As my motivation-- when I was 14 years old,

384
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,760
<8-15,Toby>在菲律宾被一个先天脚畸形的海军教士虐待
<8-15,Toby>I was abused in the philippines by a clubfooted navy chaplain.

385
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,090
<8-16,Sheldon>不行  就设计成一个中间儿
<8-16,Sheldon>No. we're going with middle child

386
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,980
<8-16,Sheldon>具有血液中复合胺含量不足的遗传体质倾向
<8-16,Sheldon>And a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.

387
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,480
<8-17,Toby>亏你想得出来  遗传体质你要我怎么扮?
<8-17,Toby>Swell. how do I play genetic predisposition?

388
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,760
<8-18,Sheldon>当然是如字面意思所示
<8-18,Sheldon>Subtextually, of course.

389
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,250
<8-18,Sheldon>尽情享受就好了
<8-18,Sheldon>Just have fun with it.

390
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,260
<8-18,Sheldon>早  潘妮
<8-18,Sheldon>Morning, penny.

391
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
<8-19,Penny>家庭会议开得怎么样?
<8-19,Penny>Hi. how did the intervention go?

392
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,360
<8-20,Sheldon>很不幸  我们没能说服他去戒毒所接受治疗
<8-20,Sheldon>Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.

393
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,150
<8-21,Penny>基于你昨天跟我说的那些  我一点都不惊讶
<8-21,Penny>Oh. well, based on what you told me, I am not surprised.

394
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,090
<8-22,Sheldon>但我们说服他搬出汽车旅馆了
<8-22,Sheldon>But we did convince him to leave the motel.

395
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,660
<8-22,Sheldon>进来认识一下
<8-22,Sheldon>Come say hello.

396
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,490
<8-22,Sheldon>里奥  这位是潘妮
<8-22,Sheldon>Leo. this is penny,

397
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,660
<8-22,Sheldon>我们的朋友和邻居
<8-22,Sheldon>Our friend and neighbor.

398
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,220
<8-23,Penny>你好  里奥
<8-23,Penny>Hi, leo.

399
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,120
<8-23,Penny>你现在感觉如何
<8-23,Penny>How are you feeling?

400
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,120
<8-24,Toby>潘妮  问你个问题
<8-24,Toby>Let me ask you something, penny.

401
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,890
<8-24,Toby>你有过吐得浑身都是  然后一觉醒来
<8-24,Toby>Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel

402
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,590
<8-24,Toby>发现自己身在一个破烂的汽车旅馆
<8-24,Toby>Covered in your own vomit,

403
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,620
<8-24,Toby>身边还躺着个人妖妓女的经历吗
<8-24,Toby>Next to a transsexual prostitute?

404
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,620
<8-25,Penny>没有
<8-25,Penny>No.

405
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,960
<8-26,Toby>那就别问我感觉如何
<8-26,Toby>Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

406
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,390
<8-27,Leonard>这位就是里奥
<8-27,Leonard>Well, that's leo.

407
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,460
<8-27,Leonard>跟我说说你昨晚的演出吧
<8-27,Leonard>Why don't you tell me about your showcase last night.

408
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,890
<8-28,Penny>还好啦  我觉得
<8-28,Penny>Oh. it was okay, I guess.

409
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,930
<8-28,Penny>场面不算太热烈
<8-28,Penny>It wasn't a big turnout,

410
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,890
<8-28,Penny>但他俩好像都很喜欢我的表演
<8-28,Penny>But they both really seemed to like it.

411
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,620
<8-29,Leonard>就俩人?
<8-29,Leonard>There were only two people there?

412
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,220
<8-30,Penny>坚持到最后的  是的
<8-30,Penny>By the end, yeah.

413
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,660
<8-31,Toby>你个该死的哈里根教士!
<8-31,Toby>Damn you, chaplain harrigan!

414
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,990
<8-32,Penny>你...你说什么
<8-32,Penny>I'm... I'm sorry?

415
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,860
<8-32,Penny>那是在菲律宾的时候
<8-32,Penny>The philippines.

416
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,020
<8-33,Toby>1992年
<8-33,Toby>1992.

417
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,050
<8-33,Toby>在苏比克湾海军基地(美国位于菲律宾吕宋岛的海军维修基地)
<8-33,Toby>The subic bay naval station.

418
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,260
<8-33,Toby>一个年轻的男孩即将步入成年
<8-33,Toby>A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

419
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,460
<8-33,Toby>他的同伴只剩下
<8-33,Toby>His only companions,

420
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,820
<8-33,Toby>杂种狗和疟疾蚊子
<8-33,Toby>Mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.

421
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,420
<8-33,Toby>绝望交织着孤独
<8-33,Toby>Desperate and alone,

422
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,060
<8-33,Toby>他遇见这个许诺将他引荐给
<8-33,Toby>He reached out to a man who promised to introduce him

423
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,720
<8-33,Toby>仁爱上帝的男人
<8-33,Toby>To a merciful, loving god,

424
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,720
<8-33,Toby>但恰恰相反  却将他引荐给了
<8-33,Toby>But who instead introduced him

425
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:23,460
<8-33,Toby>一个大醉松子酒  舌头卷进喉咙的小青年
<8-33,Toby>To a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat.

426
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,890
<8-33,Toby>除了用酗酒  吸毒
<8-33,Toby>What choice did he have but to drink,

427
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,720
<8-33,Toby>来宣泄痛苦  他还有什么选择呢?
<8-33,Toby>Shoot and snort his pain away?

428
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,300
<8-34,Sheldon>别忘了是他的遗传体质引发的吸毒成瘾
<8-34,Sheldon>Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.

429
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,260
<8-36,Sheldon>-那从未被证实  -有过很多研究
<8-36,Sheldon>That's never been proven. there have been studies.

430
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,580
<8-37,Toby>但不是双盲试验啊
<8-37,Toby>Not double-blind studies.

431
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,040
<8-38,Sheldon>怎么可能实施双盲试验?
<8-38,Sheldon>How could there be a double-blind study?

432
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,420
<8-38,Sheldon>谁来做对照组?
<8-38,Sheldon>Who would be the control group?

433
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,630
<8-39,Leonard>正如你看到的  戒毒是件很丑陋的事情
<8-39,Leonard>As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly.

434
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,860
<8-39,Leonard>我们给他们点空间
<8-39,Leonard>Let's give them some privacy.

435
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,190
<8-39,Leonard>好
<8-39,Leonard>Yeah.

436
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,890
<8-40,Penny>想来我家坐坐  喝杯咖啡吗
<8-40,Penny>Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?

437
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,120
<8-41,Leonard>不错啊
<8-41,Leonard>Oh, sounds good.

438
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,050
<8-42,Penny>我有我昨晚唱歌的录像
<8-42,Penny>I have a video of me singing last night.

439
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,090
<8-42,Penny>想看吗
<8-42,Penny>Do you want to see it?

440
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,400
<8-43,Leonard>为什么不呢?
<8-43,Leonard>Gee, why wouldn't i?

441
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,380
<8-44,Penny>这比你亲自去看演出都要精彩
<8-44,Penny>This is even better than you coming to the showcase,

442
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,260
<8-44,Penny>因为我要看着你看着我唱歌
<8-44,Penny>Because now I get to watch you watch me.

443
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,020
<8-44,Penny>是啊...
<8-44,Penny>Yeah...

444
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,200
<8-45,Leonard>事情的进展真搞笑
<8-45,Leonard>Funny how things work out.

445
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,260
<8-46,Toby>...可是他喜欢那些同伴
<8-46,Toby>...but he loved the companionship

446
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,990
<8-46,Toby>还有他的父亲无法给予他的智慧
<8-46,Toby>And the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.

447
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,530
<8-47,Sheldon>你父母做了正确的决定
<8-47,Sheldon>Your parents made the right decision.

448
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,160
<8-48,Toby>我没法这样工作
<8-48,Toby>I cannot work like this.

449
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,900
<9-1,Toby>这种感觉太棒了
<9-1,Toby>This is amazing.

450
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,560
<9-1,Toby>坐在沙发上跟一个女人一起看电视
<9-1,Toby>Just sitting on a couch watching tv with a woman.

451
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,910
<9-1,Toby>不酗酒  不磕药
<9-1,Toby>Not being drunk or, or high

452
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,900
<9-1,Toby>也不用担心你是个人妖
<9-1,Toby>Or wondering if you're a dude down there.

453
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,330
<9-2,Penny>里奥  你真的是个很可爱也很有趣的男生
<9-2,Penny>Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy.

454
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,700
<9-2,Penny>你一定会没事的
<9-2,Penny>You're going to do okay.

455
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,980
<9-3,Toby>潘妮  每天都能有这么一次就够了
<9-3,Toby>One day at a time, penny.

456
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,420
<9-3,Toby>每天都能有这么一次就够了
<9-3,Toby>One day at a time.

457
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,670
<9-4,Leonard>他还要在这待多久?
<9-4,Leonard>How long is he going to stay here?

458
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,600
<9-5,Sheldon>里奥纳德  他是个无家可归的吸毒者
<9-5,Sheldon>He's a homeless drug addict, leonard.

459
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,560
<9-5,Sheldon>他能去哪?
<9-5,Sheldon>Where is he going to go?

460
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,630
<9-5,Sheldon>天啊  你真得好好学学怎么撒谎了
<9-5,Sheldon>Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
