66
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,890
<3-18,Howard>所以今晚的"重活"大多得靠你了
<3-18,Howard>so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.

69
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,950
<4-1,Sheldon>庆祝他的成就

<4-3,Sheldon>只是这是我认识他的这些年来
<4-3,Sheldon>Yes, it's just that in all the years I've known him,

<4-3,Sheldon>他从未有过机会得到我的赞赏
<4-3,Sheldon>he's never had the opportunity to receive my admiration.

73
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,610
<4-3,Sheldon>本来还期待看他得到赞赏时
<4-3,Sheldon>I was excited to see the look on his face

74
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,610
<4-3,Sheldon>脸上那表情呢
<4-3,Sheldon>when it finally happened.

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,710
<4-7,Penny>男女分队如何
<4-7,Penny>How about boys versus girls?

80
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,120
<4-8,Sheldon>这会不会不太公平
<4-8,Sheldon>Oh! That hardly seems fair.

81
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,440
<4-8,Sheldon>我加入任何一队
<4-8,Sheldon>But I guess any team that I'm not on

82

<4-46,Sheldon>Wait, no, no!

141
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,810
<4-47,Penny>那个词是"波兰的"
<4-47,Penny>The word is "Polish."

143
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,790
<4-46,Sheldon>看  波兰的大香肠
<4-46,Sheldon>See, look. Polish sausage.

144
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,040
<4-46,Sheldon>由尼古拉·哥白尼提出的太阳系学说
<4-46,Sheldon>And the-the model of the solar system developed

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,120
<4-46,Sheldon>他是波兰裔的天文学家
<4-46,Sheldon>by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer.

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,130
<4-46,Sheldon>最后
<4-46,Sheldon>And then, finally,

147
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,700
<4-46,Sheldon>如果还不够充分  虽然那是不可能的
<4-46,Sheldon>if that wasn't enough-- which it should've been--

148
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,870
<4-46,Sheldon>这是被她所发现的镭的辐射
<4-46,Sheldon>This is Madame Curie killing herself

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,220
<4-46,Sheldon>尽管她后来加入了法国籍
<4-46,Sheldon>although she was a naturalized French citizen,

151
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,750
<4-46,Sheldon>可她出生时是波兰的人
<4-46,Sheldon>was Polish by birth!

152
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,270
<4-47,Penny>不好意思  那个词明明是指甲油
<4-47,Penny>Excuse me, the word is "polish."

153
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,670
<4-47,Penny>看到没  是小写的p
<4-47,Penny>See? Small "p."

154
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,940
<4-48,Sheldon>还真的是小写
<4-48,Sheldon>So it is.

155
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,830
<4-48,Sheldon>这道题我俩各打五十大板吧
<4-48,Sheldon>I guess we both share blame on this one.

<5-3,Howard>Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?

159
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,090
<5-4,Bernadette>我有点过敏而已
<5-4,Bernadette>It's just allergies.

160
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,590
<5-5,Howard>那就好
<5-5,Howard>Okay.

161
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,670
<5-6,Bernadette>吃点抗过敏药  就没事了
<5-6,Bernadette>Took some benadryl. I'll be fine.

162
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,830
<5-6,Bernadette>好了
<5-6,Bernadette>So...

<5-7,Howard>你觉得呢   每一分钟我都
<5-7,Howard>Are you kidding? Every minute of every...

165
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,640
<5-8,Bernadette (has a coughing fit)>抱歉哦
<5-8,Bernadette (has a coughing fit)>Excuse me.

<5-9,Howard>当然要啦
<5-9,Howard>Yes, we do.

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,990
<5-10,Bernadette>我们刚结婚你就出发了
<5-10,Bernadette>You left right after we got married.

169
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,580
<5-10,Bernadette>这算是我俩的蜜月呢
<5-10,Bernadette>This is like our honeymoon.

170

173
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,310
<5-12,Bernadette>有点头晕
<5-12,Bernadette>A little dizzy.

174
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,330
<5-12,Bernadette>一定是过敏药的关系
<5-12,Bernadette>Must be the benadryl.

175
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,470
<5-12,Bernadette>咱们换个体位吧
<5-12,Bernadette>Switch places with me.

<5-17,Howard>又快完事又有点小恶心啊
<5-17,Howard>Well, that was quick and a little gross.

184
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,450
<5-17,Howard>现在我了解她过去的感受了
<5-17,Howard>Now, I know how she feels.

185
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,210
<6-1,Penny>谢尔顿  你不是知道
<6-1,Penny>Hey, Sheldon, you're always

186
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,050
<6-1,Penny>很多小趣闻吗
<6-1,Penny>full of fun little facts.

187
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,170
<6-1,Penny>"虐得你屁滚尿流"这句话
<6-1,Penny>Where did the expression

188
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,040
<6-1,Penny>语源是从哪来的啊
<6-1,Penny>"got your ass handed to you" come from?

189
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,800
<6-2,Sheldon>我不知道
<6-2,Sheldon>Don't know.

190
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,810
<6-3,Penny>我猜这一定是古罗马的谚语
<6-3,Penny>I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome

191
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,970
<6-3,Penny>他们会把输家的屁股切下来
<6-3,Penny>where they'd actually chop somebody's ass off

192
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,190
<6-3,Penny>让输家看着屁股在地上滚
<6-3,Penny>and then go, "here."

193
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,450
<6-3,Penny>你懂得  也算是给"失败者之神"的献礼
<6-3,Penny>You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.

194
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,440
<6-4,Sheldon>我不是失败者
<6-4,Sheldon>I am not a loser.

195
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,680
<6-4,Sheldon>"你画我猜"根本就比不出人的智商和能力
<6-4,Sheldon>Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.

196
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,220
<6-5,Leonard>公平地说
<6-5,Leonard>Mmm, in all fairness,

197
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,890
<6-5,Leonard>"你画我猜"包含了词汇量和绘图能力
<6-5,Leonard>Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills.

198
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,620
<6-5,Leonard>算是很全面的游戏了
<6-5,Leonard>It's a pretty well-rounded game.

199
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,700
<6-6,Sheldon>巧克力豆饼干都画不好的人
<6-6,Sheldon>Lot of big talk from a man

200
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,100
<6-6,Sheldon>还敢在此大放厥词
<6-6,Sheldon>who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.

201
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,360
<6-7,Penny>算了  你再选一个游戏吧
<6-7,Penny>All right, fine, pick another game.

202
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,910
<6-7,Penny>艾米和我照样虐得你一败涂地
<6-7,Penny>Amy and I will beat you at anything.

203
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,510
<6-7,Penny>好啊
<6-7,Penny>All right.

204
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,350
<6-8,Sheldon>那我们玩

207
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,450
<6-10,Sheldon>我刚发明的游戏
<6-10,Sheldon>It's a game that I just invented,

208
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,410
<6-10,Sheldon>玩家得用西班牙语回答物理问题
<6-10,Sheldon>in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish.

209
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,870
<6-10,Sheldon>希格斯玻色子在哪里[西语]
<6-10,Sheldon>Donde esta el boson de higgs?

210
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,060
<6-11,Leonard>在粒子加速器里[西语]
<6-11,Leonard>En el acelerador de particulares.

211
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,520
<6-12,Sheldon>干得好  我的朋友[西语]
<6-12,Sheldon>Bueno, mi amigo.

212
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,830
<6-13,Penny>不  我们才不玩现编出来的蠢游戏
<6-13,Penny>No, no, we're not playing some dumb made-up game.

213
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,730
<6-14,Sheldon>哪个游戏不是编出来的
<6-14,Sheldon>All games are made up.

214
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,490
<6-14,Sheldon>那又不是大自然的产物
<6-14,Sheldon>They're not found in nature.

215
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,660
<6-14,Sheldon>当年又不是在地上挖洞时  碰巧找到的
<6-14,Sheldon>You don't just dig in the ground, come across

216
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,450
<6-14,Sheldon>拳击机械人大战系列玩具

<6-15,Leonard>换个游戏吧
<6-15,Leonard>Just pick another game.

218
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,240
<6-16,Amy>我们可以玩点体育类游戏
<6-16,Amy>Why don't we do something athletic

219
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,220
<6-16,Amy>比如去大学的泳池玩水球
<6-16,Amy>like go over to the university pool and play water polo?

220
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,700
<6-17,Leonard>不行  谢尔顿下水就沉
<6-17,Leonard>No good-- Sheldon doesn't float.

221
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,490
<6-18,Sheldon>确实如此
<6-18,Sheldon>That is true.

222
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,750
<6-18,Sheldon>我的体密度比平常人高

224
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,890
<6-19,Amy>那就玩点简单的吧
<6-19,Amy>All right, let's keep it simple.

225
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,750
<6-19,Amy>飞镖怎么样
<6-19,Amy>How about darts?

226
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,290
<6-20,Sheldon>不行  这个也不公平
<6-20,Sheldon>Oh, that's not fair either.

227
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:41,960
<6-21,Penny>怎么不行
<6-21,Penny>Why not?

228
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,790
<6-22,Sheldon>飞镖是酒吧里的游戏
<6-22,Sheldon>Darts is a bar game.

229
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,040
<6-22,Sheldon>你一到法律年龄就天天在那儿混了
<6-22,Sheldon>You've been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.

230
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,270
<6-23,Leonard>是啊  她到那年纪"才开始"
<6-23,Leonard>Yeah, that's when it started.

231
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,900
<6-24,Sheldon>总之  对于一切酒吧游戏
<6-24,Sheldon>Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage

232
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,550
<6-24,Sheldon>她都有很大优势
<6-24,Sheldon>in all tavern- based competitions.

233
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,860
<6-24,Sheldon>台球  啤酒乒乓  湿衣比赛
<6-24,Sheldon>Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests--

234
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,010
<6-24,Sheldon>湿衣比赛: 女士不穿内衣只穿T恤往身上倒水
<6-24,Sheldon>由男士来评判哪位身材最佳

235
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,010
<6-24,Sheldon>这些都不行
<6-24,Sheldon>they're all out.

236
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,600
<6-24,Sheldon>好吧
<6-24,Sheldon>Okay.

237
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,930
<6-25,Penny>不过我得声明一下
<6-25,Penny>Just for the record,

238
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,260
<6-25,Penny>我从来没参加过湿衣比赛
<6-25,Penny>I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest.

239
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,810
<6-25,Penny>我赢过  但是因为我醉时喝酒洒了一身
<6-25,Penny>I've won a few, but that's just because I spill when I'm drunk,

240
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,420
<6-25,Penny>所以
<6-25,Penny>So...

241
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,480
<6-26,Amy>我们可以去加州大学的尸体实验室
<6-26,Amy>We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA

242
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,640
<6-26,Amy>玩真人版手术游戏
<6-26,Amy>and play real-life operation.

243
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,900
<6-29,Penny>-不  -不要
<6-29,Penny>- No. - I don't think so.

244
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,000
