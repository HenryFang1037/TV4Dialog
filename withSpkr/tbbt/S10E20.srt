1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,720
<1-1,Penny>莱纳德  如果你明天不忙的话
<1-1,Penny>Hey, Leonard, if you're not busy tomorrow,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,790
<1-1,Penny>我明天下班后有个小活动
<1-1,Penny>I have to do a little reception after work.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,760
<1-2,Leonard>我愿意去
<1-2,Leonard>Oh, I would,

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,290
<1-2,Leonard>可我们明天要赶工弄一下空军的项目
<1-2,Leonard>but we need to make a push on the air force project.

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,270
<1-3,Penny>你确定不来吗
<1-3,Penny>Oh, are you sure?

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,000
<1-3,Penny>是要庆祝我们的注意力缺失症新药
<1-3,Penny>We're celebrating our new A.D.D. Drug,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,550
<1-3,Penny>到时候估计六分钟就结束了
<1-3,Penny>and it'll probably be over in, like, six minutes.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,350
<1-4,Amy>你刚才说你们明天要弄导向系统吗
<1-4,Amy>Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,440
<1-5,Leonard>对啊  怎么了
<1-5,Leonard>Yeah, why?

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,040
<1-6,Amy>谢尔顿说他明天要跟我一起弄
<1-6,Amy>Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,190
<1-6,Amy>我们的量子认知研究呢
<1-6,Amy>on our quantum perception project.

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,830
<1-7,Leonard>我们一周前就计划好了
<1-7,Leonard>We've had this planned for a week.

13
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,610
<1-8,Amy>他今早还跟我重新确认过时间呢
<1-8,Amy>Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,660
<1-9,Raj>两位  在事态开始恶化之前  别忘了
<1-9,Raj>Guys, before this gets ugly, remember,

15
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,440
<1-9,Raj>赢的人得到的可是谢尔顿
<1-9,Raj>the winner gets Sheldon.

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,040
<1-10,Penny>拉杰  你明天想跟我一起去吗
<1-10,Penny>Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,640
<1-11,Raj>你邀请我是希望我出席  还是可怜我
<1-11,Raj>Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity?

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,150
<1-11,Raj>算了  别回答了
<1-11,Raj>Actually, never mind, don't answer.

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,640
<1-11,Raj>我愿意去
<1-11,Raj>I'd love to.

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,420
<1-12,Sheldon>大家安安
<1-12,Sheldon>Hello.

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,630
<1-13,Amy>你为什么跟莱纳德说你明天
<1-13,Amy>Why did you tell Leonard you're working on

22
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,440
<1-14,Sheldon>-要跟他弄陀螺仪的项目  -的确是啊
<1-14,Sheldon>- the gyroscope tomorrow? - Because I am.

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,000
<1-15,Amy>但你答应我要跟我一起做我们的项目
<1-15,Amy>But you said you were working with me.

24
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,960
<1-16,Penny>某人邀了两妞去参加宅男舞会呢
<1-16,Penny>Someone's got two dates to the nerd prom.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,740
<1-17,Sheldon>山人自有妙计  我有办法同时做两个项目
<1-17,Sheldon>I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously.

26
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,340
<1-17,Sheldon>顺便告诉你  加州理工学院的
<1-17,Sheldon>And for your information, the summer conference

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,490
<1-17,Sheldon>代数拓扑夏季大会才是真的宅男舞会呢
<1-17,Sheldon>on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.

28
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,950
<1-18,Leonard>抱歉  不知阁下有何妙计
<1-18,Leonard>I'm sorry, what is this plan you have?

29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,870
<1-19,Sheldon>我不需要同时出现在两个地方啊
<1-19,Sheldon>Well, I'm not needed at both places at the same time.

30
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,630
<1-19,Sheldon>我用些简单小技巧就能腾出几小时
<1-19,Sheldon>And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks,

31
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,180
<1-19,Sheldon>比如表达意见时做到言简意赅
<1-19,Sheldon>such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,470
<1-20,Leonard>你什么时候能开始这样
<1-20,Leonard>When does that start?

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,850
<1-21,Sheldon>快
<1-21,Sheldon>Soon.

34
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,160
<1-21,Sheldon>你看  我本来可以说"快开始了"
<1-21,Sheldon>See, I could've said "In the near future,"

35
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,230
<1-21,Sheldon>但我没有说"快开始了"
<1-21,Sheldon>but I didn't say "In the near future,"

36
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,500
<1-21,Sheldon>因为"快开始了"比"快"多了3个字
<1-21,Sheldon>'cause "In the near future" is three more words than "Soon."

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,260
<1-21,Sheldon>"快"是1  "开"是2  "始"是3  "了"是4
<1-21,Sheldon>"In" one, "the" two, "near" three, "future" four.

38
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,200
<1-21,Sheldon>"快开始了"4个字  而"快"是1个字
<1-21,Sheldon>See "In the near future" is four, "Soon" is just one,

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,690
<1-21,Sheldon>1字比4字少  所以就省下了时间
<1-21,Sheldon>four is more than one; saving time already.

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,310
<1-22,Raj>天才
<1-22,Raj>Genius.

41
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,950
<1-22,Raj>我本来想说
<1-22,Raj>I was gonna say,

42
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,590
<1-22,Raj>"为什么会有人觉得谢尔顿是天才"
<1-22,Raj>"Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"

43
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,130
<1-22,Raj>但我没说出全部
<1-22,Raj>But I didn't.

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,300
<2-1,Sheldon>先生们  我帮艾米开好头了
<2-1,Sheldon>Gentlemen, I've got Amy up and running.

59
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,440
<2-1,Sheldon>我们该开始了吗
<2-1,Sheldon>Shall we get to work?

60
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,010
<2-2,Howard>在开始前我想问  你背着什么啊
<2-2,Howard>Uh, before we do, what are you wearing,

61
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,940
<2-2,Howard>我们假装你一切正常的这位朋友
<2-2,Howard>oh, friend who we pretend is normal?

62
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,520
<2-3,Sheldon>这是补水背包
<2-3,Sheldon>These are hydration backpacks.

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,900
<2-3,Sheldon>为了效率  这包在我口渴时
<2-3,Sheldon>Eh, for efficiency, whenever I'm thirsty,

64
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,260
<2-3,Sheldon>能让我直接补充水分
<2-3,Sheldon>I have access to water.

65
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,810
<2-3,Sheldon>而当我饿了时  我有扁豆汤
<2-3,Sheldon>Eh, when I'm hungry, I have lentil soup.

66
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,300
<2-4,Leonard>越来越装不下去了
<2-4,Leonard>It's getting harder to pretend.

67
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,200
<2-5,Howard>谢尔顿  我们现在到了这决策点
<2-5,Howard>Anyway, Sheldon, we're at a decision point

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,100
<2-5,Howard>是让氙气流通过低温制冷机
<2-5,Howard>to run the xenon stream through the cryocooler

69
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,570
<2-5,Howard>还是通过真空过滤器
<2-5,Howard>or through the vacuum filter.

70
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,730
<2-6,Sheldon>说说看两者的优缺点
<2-6,Sheldon>Run down the pros and cons of each for me.

71
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,710
<2-7,Howard>如果我们让氙气流通过低温制冷机
<2-7,Howard>Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryocooler,

72
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,040
<2-7,Howard>它会立即冷却  不会跟导管起反应
<2-7,Howard>it'll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.

73
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,440
<2-8,Sheldon>抱歉  胡萝卜丁卡着了
<2-8,Sheldon>Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.

74
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,030
<2-9,Howard>节省时间的感觉太强烈了
<2-9,Howard>You can just feel the time being saved.

75
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,000
<3-1,Sheldon>我回来啦  我可以在这八分钟
<3-1,Sheldon>Ah, I'm back, you got me for eight minutes.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,300
<3-2,Amy>谢尔顿  这样太蠢了
<3-2,Amy>Sheldon, this is silly.

77
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,160
<3-2,Amy>你这样进进出出
<3-2,Amy>You can't expect us to do quality work

78
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,910
<3-2,Amy>我们怎么有办法做出高质量的成果
<3-2,Amy>with you popping in and out like this.

79
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,330
<3-3,Sheldon>系数不是Λ是Λ₁
<3-3,Sheldon>The coefficient isn't lambda, it's lambda sub one.

80
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,480
<3-3,Sheldon>而这边  你应该考虑一下
<3-3,Sheldon>And over here, you should consider the possibility

81
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,830
<3-3,Sheldon>大脑本身处于两种不同量子态的可能性
<3-3,Sheldon>that the brain itself is in two different quantum states.

82
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,380
<3-3,Sheldon>最后问一下  你有配汤小饼干吗
<3-3,Sheldon>And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,940
<3-3,Sheldon>中央轴离心机的旋转速度
<3-3,Sheldon>The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge

84
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,930
<4-1,Howard>必须是每秒钟4转
<4-1,Howard>has to be four revolutions per second.

85
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,510
<4-2,Leonard>怎么会是每秒钟4转  必须得是7转
<4-2,Leonard>It can't be four revolutions, it's got to be seven.

86
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,210
<4-2,Leonard>7个鬼
<4-2,Leonard>Seven?!

87
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,860
<4-3,Howard>看清楚了  必须是4转
<4-3,Howard>Look at the board, it's four.

88
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,970
<4-4,Leonard>天啊  是7转好吗
<4-4,Leonard>Oh, my God, it's seven!

89
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,910
<4-3,Howard>-4转  -7转
<4-3,Howard>- Four! - Seven!

90
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,060
<4-7,Sheldon>是5.5转
<4-7,Sheldon>It's five and a half.

91
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,080
<4-8,Howard>我了个去  还真是5.5转
<4-8,Howard>Son of a bitch, it's five and a half.

92
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,800
<4-9,Sheldon>马回  就是"马上回来"的缩写
<4-9,Sheldon>B.R.B., that's short for "Be right back."

93
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,490
<4-9,Sheldon>我省下了好多时间啊
<4-9,Sheldon>I'm saving so much time!

94
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,310
<5-1,Sheldon>两个信号在脑胼胝体相遇
<5-1,Sheldon>The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum

95
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,900
<5-1,Sheldon>而T=0
<5-1,Sheldon>and T equals zero.

96
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,380
<5-1,Sheldon>而我知道某个小男孩值得嘉奖一口汤
<5-1,Sheldon>And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.

97
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,350
<5-2,Amy>太厉害了
<5-2,Amy>Incredible.

98
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,860
<5-2,Amy>谢尔顿  我原以为你无法同时兼顾两项目
<5-2,Amy>Sheldon, I didn't expect that you could work on both projects,

99
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,660
<5-2,Amy>但我真是大错特错啊
<5-2,Amy>but I, I was wrong.

100
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,540
<5-3,Sheldon>我一开始也对插勺有这种感觉
<5-3,Sheldon>You know, I felt the same way about the spork.

101
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,250
<5-3,Sheldon>一种餐具就想一次解决干的跟稀的
<5-3,Sheldon>Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil?

102
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,810
<5-3,Sheldon>怎么能行呢
<5-3,Sheldon>That'll never work.

103
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,900
<5-3,Sheldon>剧透警告  真的能行
<5-3,Sheldon>And spoiler: works.

104
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,730
<5-3,Sheldon>不得不承认
<5-3,Sheldon>I got to admit,

105
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,910
<6-1,Leonard>我们本来并不觉得你能同时兼顾两边
<6-1,Leonard>we didn't think you'd be able to do two things at once.

106
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,720
<6-2,Sheldon>我一开始也对鸭嘴兽有这种看法
<6-2,Sheldon>Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus.

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,820
<6-2,Sheldon>禽类与哺乳类合而为一的物种
<6-2,Sheldon>You know, bird and mammal in the same creature?

108
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,770
<6-2,Sheldon>怎么能呢
<6-2,Sheldon>No way.

109
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,340
<6-2,Sheldon>剧透警告  真的能
<6-2,Sheldon>And spoiler: way.

110
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,900
<7-2,Bernadette>再一次谢谢你昨晚借我用你电脑
<7-2,Bernadette>Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night.

111
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,240
<7-3,Stuart>没事
<7-3,Stuart>No problem.

112
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,060
<7-4,Bernadette>我就是上网报个税
<7-4,Bernadette>Was just doing my taxes.

113
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,250
<7-5,Stuart>好
<7-5,Stuart>Okay.

114
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,540
<7-6,Bernadette>其实要是我能...
<7-6,Bernadette>Actually, if I could...

115
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,760
<7-7,Stuart>要是我能再查看一下...
<7-7,Stuart>if I could just check one more...

116
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,040
<7-8,Bernadette>我已经把浏览器历史记录删了
<7-8,Bernadette>Already cleared the browser history.

117
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,450
<7-9,Stuart>你真是个懂事的好女人
<7-9,Stuart>You're a good woman.

118
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,540
<7-9,Stuart>你在忙什么
<7-9,Stuart>What you working on?

119
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,550
<7-10,Bernadette>在回去上班前  看看办公室的电邮往来记录
<7-10,Bernadette>Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.

120
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,640
<7-11,Stuart>对哦  你的产假快休完了
<7-11,Stuart>Oh, that's right, maternity leave's almost over.

121
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,320
<7-11,Stuart>要上班了你兴奋吗
<7-11,Stuart>Ah, you excited?

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,420
<7-12,Bernadette>当然  我是说我肯定会想哈雷
<7-12,Bernadette>Yeah, I mean, I'll miss Halley,

123
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,670
<7-12,Bernadette>但这样也挺好  可以走出家门
<7-12,Bernadette>but it'll be nice to get out of the house,

124
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,750
<7-12,Bernadette>活动活动脑子
<7-12,Bernadette>be intellectually stimulated.

125
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,980
<7-12,Bernadette>出去吃午餐  而不是当别人的午餐
<7-12,Bernadette>Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch.

126
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,160
<7-13,Stuart>不错啊  这样挺好的
<7-13,Stuart>That's great, good for you.

127
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,170
<7-14,Bernadette>是啊  反正有你和我爸妈
<7-14,Bernadette>Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents,

128
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,160
<7-14,Bernadette>她会没事的
<7-14,Bernadette>she's gonna be fine.

129
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,450
<7-15,Stuart>那是当然
<7-15,Stuart>Ah, of course she is.

130
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,730
<7-16,Bernadette>那家托儿所也不错
<7-16,Bernadette>And that day care is great.

131
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,340
<7-17,Stuart>的确  我特地去查看过
<7-17,Stuart>It is. I went to check it out,

132
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,780
<7-17,Stuart>他们对于没孩子的陌生人从窗户偷窥这一点
<7-17,Stuart>and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids

133
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,590
<7-17,Stuart>表现出非常警惕的态度
<7-17,Stuart>peek in the windows.

134
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,430
<7-18,Bernadette>再说了  我觉得我给哈雷树立了很好的榜样
<7-18,Bernadette>Plus, I, I think I'm setting a good example for Halley,

135
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,410
<7-18,Bernadette>让她知道女人就算当了妈
<7-18,Bernadette>to show her that women can be mothers

136
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,680
<7-18,Bernadette>仍可以拥有令人满意的事业
<7-18,Bernadette>and still have satisfying careers.

137
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,980
<7-18,Bernadette>当然她不会知道我去了哪  我还会不会回来
<7-18,Bernadette>Sure, she won't know where I went or if I'm ever coming back.

138
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,680
<7-18,Bernadette>等我回到家她还有十分钟就要睡觉了
<7-18,Bernadette>That'll just make the ten minutes between when I get home

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,010
<7-18,Bernadette>于是那十分钟变得更弥足珍贵
<7-18,Bernadette>and her bedtime even more special.

140
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,080
<7-19,Stuart>除了帮你拍奶嗝和给你个奶瓶外
<7-19,Stuart>Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle,

141
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,000
<7-19,Stuart>我真不知道该怎么办了
<7-19,Stuart>I don't know what to do right now.

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,560
<7-20,Bernadette>没事  我情绪过于激动了
<7-20,Bernadette>It's okay, I'm just being emotional about this.

143
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,570
<7-20,Bernadette>拜托别告诉霍华德好吗
<7-20,Bernadette>Can you not tell Howard?

144
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,730
<7-21,Stuart>你不觉得告诉他你怎么了
<7-21,Stuart>Well, don't you think it'd be healthier

145
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,830
<7-21,Stuart>更有利于你身心健康吗
<7-21,Stuart>if you told him what's going on with you?

146
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,950
<7-22,Bernadette>那你不觉得作为一个成年人
<7-22,Bernadette>Don't you think it'd be healthier

147
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,190
<7-22,Bernadette>拥有自己的公寓更有利于你的身心健康吗
<7-22,Bernadette>if you had your own apartment, grown man?

148
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,590
<7-23,Stuart>我会替你保密的
<7-23,Stuart>Your secret is safe with me.

149
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,240
<8-1,Penny>你什么时候开始周四洗衣服了
<8-1,Penny>Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,490
<8-2,Sheldon>我今天上班出了点意外
<8-2,Sheldon>Oh, I had an accident at work,

151
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,420
<8-2,Sheldon>我脚一滑  摔到我的汤袋上了
<8-2,Sheldon>I slipped and fell on my soup sack.

152
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,670
<8-3,Penny>曾几何时  我会问"什么是汤袋"
<8-3,Penny>You know, there was a time I would say "What's a soup sack?"

153
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,820
<8-3,Penny>但...我很高兴多嘴时光已过去了
<8-3,Penny>But... I'm glad we're past that.

154
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,460
<8-3,Penny>曾几何时  我会说"愿神保佑你"
<8-3,Penny>You know, there was a time I would say "God bless you,"

155
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,140
<8-3,Penny>而你会说  "如果你一定要祈求虚构的神灵保佑
<8-3,Penny>and then you would say "If you must invoke an imaginary deity,

156
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,590
<8-3,Penny>求雷神索尔怎么样"
<8-3,Penny>how about Thor?"

157
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,940
<8-3,Penny>于是我会说
<8-3,Penny>And I would say,

158
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,470
<8-3,Penny>"你怎么知道我说的不是雷神"
<8-3,Penny>"How do you know I didn't mean Thor?"

159
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,890
<8-3,Penny>然后你会说"说得好"
<8-3,Penny>And then you would say "Touche,"

160
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,160
<8-3,Penny>而从那刻起
<8-3,Penny>and that there ends the tale

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,920
<8-3,Penny>"愿神保佑你"这话与我从此是路人
<8-3,Penny>of why I no longer say "God bless you."

162
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,960
<8-4,Sheldon>咱俩这一来一往的时光也挺美  不是吗
<8-4,Sheldon>Well, we have had some fun, haven't we?

163
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,900
<8-5,Penny>是的
<8-5,Penny>Oh, yeah.

164
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,300
<8-5,Penny>莱纳德跟我说你忙得像只陀螺
<8-5,Penny>So, Leonard tells me you've had a busy day.

165
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,420
<8-6,Sheldon>没错
<8-6,Sheldon>Oh, I did.

166
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,560
<8-6,Sheldon>现在还转着呢
<8-6,Sheldon>It hasn't stopped.

167
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,220
<8-6,Sheldon>就我在预浸泡裤子  想把扁豆弄出来的时候
<8-6,Sheldon>I figured out a solution for our navigation system

168
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,760
<8-6,Sheldon>我想出了我们导向系统的一个解决方案
<8-6,Sheldon>while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.

169
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,080
<8-7,Penny>你是不是要生病了
<8-7,Penny>Are you getting sick?

170
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,150
<8-8,Sheldon>当然不是
<8-8,Sheldon>Of course not.

171
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,480
<8-8,Sheldon>我太忙没空生病
<8-8,Sheldon>I'm too busy to be sick.

172
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
<8-9,Penny>你身子挺娇弱的
<8-9,Penny>Well, you're pretty delicate.

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
<8-9,Penny>或许你不该把自己逼这么紧
<8-9,Penny>Maybe you shouldn't be pushing yourself so hard.

174
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,860
<8-11,Penny>-我好得很  -好吧
<8-11,Penny>- I'm fine. - All right.

175
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,080
<8-11,Penny>那我们就假装你看《冰雪奇缘》
<8-11,Penny>Well, we'll just pretend that you didn't catch a cold

176
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,290
<8-11,Penny>-看到感冒的事没发生  -我...
<8-11,Penny>- watching Frozen. - I...

177
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,500
<8-12,Sheldon>才没有呢
<8-12,Sheldon>That didn't happen.

178
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,000
<8-13,Penny>你看《飞屋环游记》的时候还流鼻血了
<8-13,Penny>You also got a nosebleed watching Up.

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,550
<8-14,Sheldon>少废话  快洗你的衣服
<8-14,Sheldon>Just do your laundry!

180
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,820
<9-1,Bernadette>斯图尔特  你不用特意做晚饭
<9-1,Bernadette>Stuart, you didn't have to make dinner.

181
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,760
<9-2,Stuart>没事  早上害你不开心我挺不好意思
<9-2,Stuart>Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning.

182
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,220
<9-2,Stuart>而且老实说  我不太喜欢你做的肉卷
<9-2,Stuart>And to be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.

183
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,660
<9-3,Howard>晚餐吃什么
<9-3,Howard>Hey, what's for dinner?

184
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,620
<9-4,Bernadette>肉卷
<9-4,Bernadette>Meatloaf.

185
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,350
<9-5,Howard>好吧
<9-5,Howard>Oh, cool.

186
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,220
<9-6,Bernadette>斯图尔特做的
<9-6,Bernadette>Stuart made it.

187
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,450
<9-5,Howard>好哒
<9-5,Howard>Oh, cool.

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,490
<9-7,Howard>我在想或许我们可以
<9-7,Howard>Hey, I was thinking maybe we take

189
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,330
<9-7,Howard>周末带哈雷去动物园
<9-7,Howard>Halley to the zoo this weekend,

190
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,780
<9-7,Howard>在你上班前
<9-7,Howard>get in a little family time

191
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,660
<9-7,Howard>享受一点家庭时光
<9-7,Howard>before you go back to work.

192
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,000
<9-8,Bernadette>听起来不错
<9-8,Bernadette>Sounds great.

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,600
<9-9,Howard>说到这个
<9-9,Howard>Speaking of which,

194
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,790
<9-9,Howard>关于托儿所  我不介意送她去
<9-9,Howard>for day care, it'll be easy for me

195
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,860
<9-9,Howard>但如果你很想送她  我也可以让给你
<9-9,Howard>to drop her off, unless you want to do it.

196
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,030
<9-10,Bernadette>看来是得我来送了
<9-10,Bernadette>Hmm, guess it should be me.

197
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,060
<9-11,Stuart>我送不了
<9-11,Stuart>I can't do it;

198
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,000
<9-11,Stuart>他们有我的照片记录在案
<9-11,Stuart>they have a picture of me on file now.

199
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,890
<9-12,Howard>你没事吧
<9-12,Howard>You okay?

200
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,390
<9-13,Bernadette>当然  怎么了
<9-13,Bernadette>Of course, why?

201
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,560
<9-14,Howard>我不知道  你看起来有点不开心
<9-14,Howard>Well, I don't know, you seem a little upset.

202
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,300
<9-16,Howard>-我没事  -你确定吗
<9-16,Howard>- No, I'm fine. - You sure?

203
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,640
<9-17,Stuart>你干嘛觉得人家有事
<9-17,Stuart>Why don't you think she's fine?

204
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,500
<9-17,Stuart>她的声音听起来没事  她的样子看起来也没事
<9-17,Stuart>She sounds fine, she looks fine.

205
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,900
<9-17,Stuart>如果我在街上看到她  我一定会说
<9-17,Stuart>If I saw her on the street I'd say,

206
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,020
<9-17,Stuart>"靠  这妞没事[正点]"
<9-17,Stuart>"Damn, that girl's fine!"

207
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,630
<10-1,Amy>谢尔顿  你生病了  躺回床上吧
<10-1,Amy>Sheldon, you're sick, go back to bed.

208
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,830
<10-2,Sheldon>我没事
<10-2,Sheldon>I am fine.

209
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,950
<10-2,Sheldon>给  吃你的吐司
<10-2,Sheldon>Here, eat your toast.

210
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,680
<10-2,Sheldon>抱歉
<10-2,Sheldon>Sorry.

211
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,240
<10-3,Amy>没事  这下黄油都省了
<10-3,Amy>It's okay, now I don't need butter.

212
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,470
<10-4,Sheldon>或许我是有一点受了风寒
<10-4,Sheldon>Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather.

213
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,370
<10-4,Sheldon>但吃点感冒药  喝点茶就没事了
<10-4,Sheldon>It's nothing a little cold medicine and tea can't fix.

214
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,560
<10-5,Amy>你需要睡眠
<10-5,Amy>You need sleep.

215
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,760
<10-6,Sheldon>我需要的是去工作
<10-6,Sheldon>What I need is to get to work.

216
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,590
<10-7,Amy>我不想被你的病菌传染
<10-7,Amy>Well, I don't want your germs around me.

217
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,290
<10-8,Sheldon>怎么  你牵我的手  亲我的嘴就行
<10-8,Sheldon>What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth,

218
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,750
<10-8,Sheldon>但我发烧到39度就过界了吗
<10-8,Sheldon>but you draw the line at 102 fever?

219
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,300
<10-8,Sheldon>我们的爱情怎么了
<10-8,Sheldon>What happened to our love?

220
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,960
<11-1,Amy>谢尔顿  你没事吧
<11-1,Amy>Sheldon, are you okay?

221
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,550
<11-2,Sheldon>怎么回事
<11-2,Sheldon>What's going on?

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,310
<11-2,Sheldon>我怎么会在这里
<11-2,Sheldon>How'd I get here?

223
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,960
<11-3,Leonard>我也不知道  我们下班回家就看到你在这儿了
<11-3,Leonard>I don't know, we came home from work and we found you.

224
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,340
<11-4,Sheldon>下班回家
<11-4,Sheldon>Home from work?

225
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,560
<11-4,Sheldon>现在几点
<11-4,Sheldon>What time is it?

226
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,590
<11-4,Sheldon>9点
<11-4,Sheldon>9:00.

227
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,290
<11-4,Sheldon>9点了
<11-4,Sheldon>9:00?!

228
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,090
<11-6,Sheldon>那8点和7点  还有之前那么多点
<11-6,Sheldon>W-What happened to 8:00 and 7:00

229
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,550
<11-6,Sheldon>都到哪儿去了
<11-6,Sheldon>and all the other o'clocks?

230
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,300
<11-7,Raj>等下  你不记得了吗
<11-7,Raj>Wait, you don't remember?

231
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,890
<11-8,Sheldon>我记得早上起床
<11-8,Sheldon>Well, I remember waking up in the morning,

232
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,710
<11-8,Sheldon>艾米在我胸口抹感冒舒缓膏
<11-8,Sheldon>Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest.

233
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,860
<11-8,Sheldon>她的手又冰又糙  像两大块冻土
<11-8,Sheldon>And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra.

234
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,180
<11-8,Sheldon>然后我吃了点感冒药  就...
<11-8,Sheldon>I took some cold medicine to...

235
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,780
<11-8,Sheldon>我吃了感冒药
<11-8,Sheldon>I took cold medicine.

236
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,010
<11-9,Leonard>你来实验室时
<11-9,Leonard>You did seem a little loopy

237
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,540
<11-9,Leonard>看起来的确有点呆滞
<11-9,Leonard>when you showed up at the lab.

238
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,910
<11-10,Sheldon>实验室
<11-10,Sheldon>At-- at the lab?!

239
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,620
<11-10,Sheldon>为什么我的下半身是赤裸的
<11-10,Sheldon>Why am I naked from the waist down?

240
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,590
<11-11,Raj>我不知道你的裤子在哪里
<11-11,Raj>I don't know where your pants are,

241
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,260
<11-11,Raj>但我们倒是在炉子上的锅里发现你的内裤
<11-11,Raj>but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.

242
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,310
<12-1,Sheldon>我的裤子不见了  我什么都不记得了
<12-1,Sheldon>My pants are missing, I don't remember anything.

243
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,380
<12-1,Sheldon>佩妮  你青春在断片中度过  分享下经验
<12-1,Sheldon>Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?

244
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,700
<12-1,Sheldon>我不知道
<12-1,Sheldon>I don't know,

245
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,800
<12-2,Penny>检查一下有没有新纹身吧
<12-2,Penny>check your body for tattoos?

246
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,090
<12-3,Sheldon>莱纳德  你能不能当个贴心的宝宝...
<12-3,Sheldon>Leonard, would you be a lamb...

247
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,140
<12-4,Leonard>她在逗你的
<12-4,Leonard>She's kidding!

248
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,930
<12-5,Sheldon>等等  我的背包呢
<12-5,Sheldon>Wait, wait. Where's my bag?

249
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,880
<12-5,Sheldon>-我的电话跟钱包都在里头  -在这里
<12-5,Sheldon>- My phone and my wallet are in my bag. - It's right here.

250
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,270
<12-7,Sheldon>我的笔记本呢  我的笔记本不见了  不要啊
<12-7,Sheldon>Where's my notebook? My notebook's gone. Oh, no.

251
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,140
<12-8,Penny>不过是本笔记本而已  有什么大不了的
<12-8,Penny>Okay, it's just a notebook, what's the big deal?

252
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,390
<12-8,Penny>有什么大不了的
<12-8,Penny>What's the big deal?

253
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,140
<12-9,Sheldon>里面全是关于那个空军项目的机密信息
<12-9,Sheldon>It's full of classified information about the air force project!

254
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,460
<12-10,Leonard>你怎么能把那个弄丢了呢
<12-10,Leonard>How could you lose that?

255
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,400
<12-11,Amy>没关系  我们一定能找着
<12-11,Amy>It's okay, I'm sure we'll find it.

256
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,870
<12-12,Penny>肯定就在这里的某个角落
<12-12,Penny>Look, it's got to be around here somewhere.

257
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,870
<12-13,Amy>也许跟你的裤子在同个地方
<12-13,Amy>Maybe it's wherever your pants are.

258
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,770
<12-14,Raj>不  裤子在微波炉里  笔记本不在
<12-14,Raj>Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook.

259
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,910
<13-2,Stuart>你好
<13-2,Stuart>Ah, hello.

260
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,800
<13-3,Howard>伯纳黛特好像有心事
<13-3,Howard>Look, something's going on with Bernadette.

261
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,500
<13-3,Howard>她有跟你说什么吗
<13-3,Howard>She say anything to you?

262
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,480
<13-4,Stuart>一个字都没说
<13-4,Stuart>Well, nope, not a word.

263
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,390
<13-5,Howard>别这样  跟我说实话
<13-5,Howard>Come on, be honest.

264
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,380
<13-5,Howard>你是不是告诉她  我偷用过她的吸奶器
<13-5,Howard>Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?

265
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,230
<13-6,Stuart>没有  但我倒是跟我的心理医生提过
<13-6,Stuart>No, but I did mention it to my therapist.

266
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,300
<13-7,Howard>反正她肯定是在生我的气
<13-7,Howard>Well, I know she's mad at me about something.

267
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,110
<13-8,Stuart>你做了什么会惹怒她的事
<13-8,Stuart>Well, what have you done that would upset her?

268
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,480
<13-9,Howard>那要看你有多少时间听
<13-9,Howard>Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?

269
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,310
<13-10,Stuart>要不你先说最严重的那件事呗
<13-10,Stuart>Well, why don't you just start with the worst thing?

270
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,260
<13-11,Howard>我想想啊
<13-11,Howard>Hmm, let's see.

271
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,110
<13-11,Howard>好  来吧  六年前
<13-11,Howard>Okay, here we go: six years ago,

272
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,410
<13-11,Howard>我接到一通电话  说妮妮的姨婆特里克茜去世了
<13-11,Howard>I got a call that Bernie's great-aunt, Trixie, died.

273
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,990
<13-12,Stuart>然后呢
<13-12,Stuart>And?

274
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,860
<13-13,Howard>然后我忘记转告她
<13-13,Howard>And I forgot to give her the message.

275
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,050
<13-14,Stuart>太过分了
<13-14,Stuart>That's terrible.

276
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,740
<13-15,Howard>真正过分的是  从那之后
<13-15,Howard>The terrible part is, ever since then,

277
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,110
<13-15,Howard>我以特里克茜的名义
<13-15,Howard>I've been sending Bernie

278
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,130
<13-15,Howard>每年都给妮妮寄圣诞贺卡
<13-15,Howard>Christmas cards from Trixie.

279
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,100
<13-16,Stuart>霍华德
<13-16,Stuart>Howard!

280
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,800
<13-17,Howard>听我说完  有张贺卡里还夹了五块钱
<13-17,Howard>Let me finish-- and one card had five dollars in it

281
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,360
<13-17,Howard>是我从妮妮的钱包里偷的
<13-17,Howard>I took from Bernie's purse.

282
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,180
<14-1,Penny>笔记本不在浴室里
<14-1,Penny>The notebook isn't in the bathroom.

283
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,360
<14-2,Amy>我也找不到
<14-2,Amy>I can't find it, either.

284
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,180
<14-2,Amy>他怎么能失忆一整天呢
<14-2,Amy>How can he not remember a day?

285
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,860
<14-3,Penny>被外星人掳走过的人会不记得那段时间
<14-3,Penny>Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time.

286
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,670
<14-3,Penny>可能那也会发生在外星人自己身上吧
<14-3,Penny>I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.

287
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,170
<14-4,Leonard>不在对面的屋子里
<14-4,Leonard>Well, it's not across the hall.

288
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,350
<14-5,Sheldon>已成定局了  我违反了保密协议
<14-5,Sheldon>That's it. I'm in breach of my security clearance.

289
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,100
<14-6,Raj>我要去蹲大牢了
<14-6,Raj>I'm going to prison.

290
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,250
<14-5,Sheldon>你们也懂我这种可人儿进监狱会有何下场
<14-5,Sheldon>And you know what happens to people like me in prison.

291
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,730
<14-5,Sheldon>我会被迫当某位大佬的私人教师
<14-5,Sheldon>I'll be forced to be some large man's tutor.

292
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,520
<14-6,Raj>你不会进监狱的
<14-6,Raj>You're not going to prison.

293
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,810
<14-7,Leonard>可是想想那个画面  还真是乐开怀
<14-7,Leonard>But, boy, it is funny to think about.

294
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,280
<14-8,Amy>你真的什么都想不起来吗
<14-8,Amy>You really can't remember anything?

295
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,580
<14-9,Sheldon>我在想啊
<14-9,Sheldon>I'm trying.

296
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,390
<14-10,Raj>等等  给我看看你的手机
<14-10,Raj>Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.

297
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,370
<14-11,Sheldon>为什么
<14-11,Sheldon>Why?

298
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,640
<14-12,Raj>手机有可能
<14-12,Raj>Well, it's-- it's possible

299
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,580
<14-12,Raj>记录下你去过的所有地方
<14-12,Raj>it was tracking everywhere you went.

300
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,560
<14-13,Amy>手机还有这个功能吗
<14-13,Amy>Phones can do that?

301
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,410
<14-14,Raj>是的  得看你隐私设置了
<14-14,Raj>Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings.

302
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,310
<14-15,Penny>这功能好酷啊
<14-15,Penny>Oh, tha-- that's so cool.

303
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,650
<14-15,Penny>要怎么...  怎么样才能关掉啊
<14-15,Penny>How do you-- how do you turn that thing off?

304
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,940
<14-16,Leonard>淡定
<14-16,Leonard>Relax.

305
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,150
<14-16,Leonard>我知道你"去跑步"时  中途吃了个甜甜圈
<14-16,Leonard>I know when you "go for a run," you stop for a donut.

306
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,170
<14-17,Penny>我不是跑过去的  我是开车去的
<14-17,Penny>I don't even run there, I drive.

307
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,990
<14-18,Raj>稍等  我能看到你去过的所有地点了
<14-18,Raj>Hang on, I can see every place you went.

308
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,030
<14-19,Sheldon>记录怎么说
<14-19,Sheldon>What does it say?

309
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,990
<14-20,Raj>你在这栋楼里
<14-20,Raj>Uh, you were in the building,

310
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,480
<14-20,Raj>你到过大学
<14-20,Raj>you were at the university,

311
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,870
<14-20,Raj>然后你到了科罗拉多大道上的某处
<14-20,Raj>then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.

312
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,910
<14-21,Sheldon>哪里
<14-21,Sheldon>Where?

313
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,180
<14-22,Raj>等等
<14-22,Raj>Wait, hang on.

314
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,120
<14-22,Raj>你有去过牛仔酒吧吗
<14-22,Raj>Did you go to a cowboy bar?

315
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,670
<14-23,Sheldon>我...怎么可能
<14-23,Sheldon>I-- no!

316
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,740
<14-23,Sheldon>太荒谬了
<14-23,Sheldon>That is preposterous.

317
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,890
<14-23,Sheldon>有可能
<14-23,Sheldon>Maybe.

318
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,620
<15-1,Howard>你还好吗
<15-1,Howard>Hey, how's it going?

319
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,830
<15-2,Bernadette>好啊
<15-2,Bernadette>Fine.

320
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,120
<15-3,Howard>好吧  爱你哦
<15-3,Howard>Good. Love you.

321
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,760
<15-4,Bernadette>-我也爱你  -爱你更多
<15-4,Bernadette>- Love you, too. - Love you more.

322
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,320
<15-6,Bernadette>行  你赢了  我能继续做事了吗
<15-6,Bernadette>Okay, you won. Can I finish what I'm doing?

323
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,790
<15-7,Howard>抱歉
<15-7,Howard>Sure, sorry.

324
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,060
<15-8,Bernadette>你有事吗
<15-8,Bernadette>Something on your mind?

325
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,820
<15-9,Howard>没  没事
<15-9,Howard>No, no, nothing.

326
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,730
<15-9,Howard>好吧  我只是觉得
<15-9,Howard>Okay, well, maybe I'm just feeling like

327
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,790
<15-9,Howard>你好像有烦心事
<15-9,Howard>something's bothering you.

328
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,570
<15-10,Bernadette>不  我好着呢
<15-10,Bernadette>Nope, all good.

329
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,420
<15-11,Howard>为了证明  和我在厨房地板上滚一炮吧
<15-11,Howard>Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.

330
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,980
<15-12,Bernadette>才不要  你脑子有病吧
<15-12,Bernadette>No, what is wrong with you?

331
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,360
<15-13,Howard>看吧  你就是不开心
<15-13,Howard>Aha, you are upset.

332
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,320
<15-13,Howard>我虽不了解女人  但我知道我让她们不开心了
<15-13,Howard>I don't know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.

333
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,250
<15-14,Bernadette>霍华德  抱歉我可能举止有点怪
<15-14,Bernadette>Howard, I'm sorry if I'm being weird,

334
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,300
<15-14,Bernadette>但这件事和你没有关系
<15-14,Bernadette>but it has nothing to do with you.

335
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,540
<15-15,Howard>真的跟我无关吗
<15-15,Howard>It doesn't?

336
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,020
<15-15,Howard>没有
<15-15,Howard>No.

337
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,070
<15-16,Bernadette>我不想告诉你  但是...
<15-16,Bernadette>I didn't want to tell you, but...

338
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,150
<15-16,Bernadette>我心里对于回去工作这件事挺不好受
<15-16,Bernadette>I'm having a really tough time about going back to work.

339
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,870
<15-17,Howard>这样呀  我明白
<15-17,Howard>Okay, well, I get that.

340
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,480
<15-17,Howard>当我陪产假结束时  也很难过
<15-17,Howard>It was hard for me when I went back.

341
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,660
<15-18,Bernadette>-真的吗  -当然啦
<15-18,Bernadette>- It was? - Of course.

342
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,350
<15-19,Howard>我万分思念你和宝宝
<15-19,Howard>I missed you and the baby

343
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,980
<15-19,Howard>还有每天能看《艾伦秀》的快乐时光
<15-19,Howard>and being able to watch Ellen every day.

344
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,450
<15-20,Bernadette>我只是不知道什么才算是正确的选择
<15-20,Bernadette>I just don't know what the right thing to do is.

345
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,980
<15-20,Bernadette>如果我回去上班  我就像抛弃了哈雷
<15-20,Bernadette>If I go back to work, I'm abandoning Halley.

346
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,160
<15-20,Bernadette>如果我不上班
<15-20,Bernadette>If I don't go,

347
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,660
<15-20,Bernadette>那就放弃了我以前奋斗的事业
<15-20,Bernadette>I'm giving up everything I worked for.

348
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,940
<15-20,Bernadette>感觉就没有一个正确的选择
<15-20,Bernadette>It's like there's no right choice.

349
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,630
<15-21,Howard>我也不知道什么才算是正确的选择
<15-21,Howard>Look, I don't know what the best decision is, either.

350
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,870
<15-21,Howard>但不管我们如何做  只要不开心
<15-21,Howard>But whatever we choose, if we're not happy,

351
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,880
<15-21,Howard>那我们就换一种选择
<15-21,Howard>we can undo it.

352
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,690
<15-22,Bernadette>也许吧
<15-22,Bernadette>I guess.

353
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,610
<15-23,Howard>而最棒的是  哈雷完全不会记得这些事
<15-23,Howard>And the best part is: Halley won't remember a thing.

354
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,560
<15-23,Howard>宝宝们虽然可爱  但也傻呼呼的
<15-23,Howard>Babies are cute, but they're dumb.

355
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,680
<15-23,Howard>你看  我把脸遮住
<15-23,Howard>I mean, I-I go like this,

356
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,120
<15-23,Howard>她就觉得我不见了  手打开  我又回来了
<15-23,Howard>she thinks I'm gone. Then magically I'm back.

357
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,510
<15-23,Howard>老实说  我们干嘛还费劲给她存大学学费呢
<15-23,Howard>Honestly, why are we saving for college?

358
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,670
<15-24,Bernadette>我不喜欢你说我们宝宝蠢
