00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,950
<1-1,Sheldon>今天真是玩得太开心了  谢谢
<1-1,Sheldon>What a wonderful day, thank you.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,460
<1-2,Penny>你开心就好
<1-2,Penny>Oh, we're glad you had fun.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,230
<1-3,Sheldon>喝了蓝色冰沙  还去了趟容器大卖场
<1-3,Sheldon>Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store?

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,320
<1-3,Sheldon>感觉就像我死了
<1-3,Sheldon>It's like I died

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,740
<1-3,Sheldon>进入了死后脑神经元诱发的幻觉
<1-3,Sheldon>and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,150
<1-3,Sheldon>也就是俗称天堂的地方
<1-3,Sheldon>commonly mistaken as heaven.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,440
<1-4,Leonard>我还是不明白你为什么会买那个药盒
<1-4,Leonard>I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,720
<1-4,Leonard>你好好一个年轻人
<1-4,Leonard>You're a young man.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,630
<1-5,Sheldon>莱纳德  年龄是一种心理状态
<1-5,Sheldon>Age is a state of mind, Leonard.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,130
<1-5,Sheldon>我这儿已经90岁了
<1-5,Sheldon>In here I'm 90.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,260
<1-5,Sheldon>你为什么把你的箱子带去那边
<1-5,Sheldon>Why are you taking your bins over there?

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,040
<1-6,Leonard>我就是买来放这边的啊
<1-6,Leonard>That's just where I need them.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,160
<1-6,Leonard>因为她家衣柜空间不太够
<1-6,Leonard>You know, she doesn't have a lot of closet space.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,220
<1-7,Sheldon>你自己房里的衣柜怎么了
<1-7,Sheldon>What's wrong with your closet?

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,720
<1-8,Penny>亲爱的
<1-8,Penny>Well, honey, you know,

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,570
<1-8,Penny>我和莱纳德现在结婚了
<1-8,Penny>now that Leonard and I are married,

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,480
<1-8,Penny>我们真的住在一起也合情合理
<1-8,Penny>it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,590
<1-9,Sheldon>原来今天是这么个节奏
<1-9,Sheldon>So that's all this day was?

19
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,110
<1-9,Sheldon>先礼后兵  图穷匕见
<1-9,Sheldon>A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,070
<1-10,Leonard>兄弟  别这样
<1-10,Leonard>Come on, buddy.

21
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,590
<1-11,Sheldon>少来这套  我还以为我们是朋友呢
<1-11,Sheldon>No, I thought we were friends.

22
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,580
<1-11,Sheldon>你想喝一口我的冰沙
<1-11,Sheldon>You asked for a sip of my Icee.

23
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,440
<1-11,Sheldon>如果当时你自己有吸管  我可能就答应了呢
<1-11,Sheldon>If you had your own straw, I might've said yes.

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,710
<1-12,Penny>谢尔顿别这样  我们本来就过意不去了
<1-12,Penny>Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,060
<1-13,Sheldon>你知道容器大卖场里没有卖什么吗
<1-13,Sheldon>You know what they don't sell at The Container Store?

26
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,130
<1-13,Sheldon>大到可以装下我满心失望的东西
<1-13,Sheldon>Something large enough to contain my disappointment.

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,420
<1-13,Sheldon>如果世上真的有卖
<1-13,Sheldon>Although, if anyone did,

28
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,050
<1-13,Sheldon>那肯定是它们那里
<1-13,Sheldon>it would be them.

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,150
<1-13,Sheldon>翻译：钢鸟侠赛塔克  小辣椒·猫兹
<1-13,Sheldon>别扭大菜

39
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,070
<2-1,Sheldon>谢谢你让我来跟你谈谈心
<2-1,Sheldon>Thank you for letting me come speak with you.

40
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,350
<2-2,Bernadette>这有什么
<2-2,Bernadette>Of course.

41
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,090
<2-3,Sheldon>鉴于最近我跟佩妮与艾米的关系紧张
<2-3,Sheldon>As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained,

42
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,700
<2-3,Sheldon>所以我得转而向你寻求女性的安慰与鼓励
<2-3,Sheldon>I'm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.

43
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,840
<2-3,Sheldon>我很荣幸
<2-3,Sheldon>I'm honored.

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,210
<2-5,Sheldon>我试着找过我妈
<2-5,Sheldon>I tried reaching out to my mother,

45
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,610
<2-5,Sheldon>可是她在上查经班
<2-5,Sheldon>but she was in Bible study.

46
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,300
<2-5,Sheldon>莱纳德的母亲在巡回签书途中
<2-5,Sheldon>Leonard's mother is on a book tour.

47
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,770
<2-5,Sheldon>我姥姥在睡午觉
<2-5,Sheldon>My Mee-Maw was taking a nap,

48
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,630
<2-5,Sheldon>而且一段时间后  Siri的答案开始重复了
<2-5,Sheldon>and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.

49
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,440
<2-6,Bernadette>所以我是你的第七选择
<2-6,Bernadette>So, I'm your seventh choice.

50
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,340
<2-7,Sheldon>对啊  进入前十了呢  很激动吧
<2-7,Sheldon>Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.

51
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,560
<2-8,Bernadette>我可以帮你什么呢
<2-8,Bernadette>How can I help you?

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,380
<2-9,Sheldon>在艾米离开我之后
<2-9,Sheldon>Well, in addition to Amy leaving me,

53
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,340
<2-9,Sheldon>莱纳德也要搬去跟佩妮同住了
<2-9,Sheldon>Leonard's moving in with Penny.

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,730
<2-9,Sheldon>我难免会觉得自己被人抛弃
<2-9,Sheldon>It's difficult not to feel abandoned.

55
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,800
<2-10,Bernadette>你何不把这个危机看成转机呢
<2-10,Bernadette>Well, why don't you look at this as an opportunity?

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,620
<2-10,Bernadette>你在莱纳德来之前也有过室友啊
<2-10,Bernadette>You had other roommates before Leonard.

57
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,630
<2-10,Bernadette>或许这是你寻找新室友的机会
<2-10,Bernadette>Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.

58
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,140
<2-11,Sheldon>或许我可以找到比莱纳德更棒的人
<2-11,Sheldon>Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard.

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,280
<2-11,Sheldon>找个让他吃醋咬手绢儿的人
<2-11,Sheldon>Someone I can rub in his face.

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,830
<2-11,Sheldon>克里斯·帕拉特最近挺火的
<2-11,Sheldon>Chris Pratt's all the rage right now.

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,830
<2-11,Sheldon>美国男演员  在《银河护卫队》《侏罗纪世界》
<2-11,Sheldon>这两部炙手可热的电影中都出演了男主角

62
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,880
<2-11,Sheldon>不知道他能不能接受住进家里小的卧室
<2-11,Sheldon>I wonder how he'd feel about taking the smaller bedroom.

63
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,350
<2-13,Bernadette>你知道谁会是完美的室友吗
<2-13,Bernadette>You know who would be the perfect roommate?

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,180
<2-14,Sheldon>《魔戒》里的甘道夫  可是他抽烟斗
<2-14,Sheldon>Gandalf, but he's a smoker.

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,100
<2-14,Sheldon>斯图尔特
<2-14,Sheldon>Stuart.

66
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,680
<2-15,Bernadette>他已经跟我们同住一阵子了
<2-15,Bernadette>He's been living with us for a while now.

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,430
<2-15,Bernadette>我相信他也一定很想摆脱我们
<2-15,Bernadette>I'm sure he'd love to get us out of his hair.

68
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,220
<2-16,Stuart>并没有  快乐得不得了
<2-16,Stuart>Nope, couldn't be happier.

69
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,540
<2-17,Bernadette>谢尔顿在找个新...
<2-17,Bernadette>Well, Sheldon's looking for a...

70
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,840
<2-18,Stuart>不要
<2-18,Stuart>Nope.

71
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,330
<2-19,Bernadette>-他会再考虑的  -才不会呢
<2-19,Bernadette>- He'll think about it. - No I won't!

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,920
<3-1,Raj>你看过这本《阿奇漫画》吗
<3-1,Raj>Have you seen this Archie comic?

73
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,330
<3-1,Raj>其实是阿奇大战铁血战士
<3-1,Raj>It's actually Archie versus Predator.

74
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,980
<3-2,Howard>阿奇怎么打得过铁血战士啊
<3-2,Howard>How could Archie defeat Predator?

75
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,490
<3-2,Howard>我也不知道
<3-2,Howard>I don't know.

76
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,180
<3-3,Raj>说不定阿奇的死党其实是终结者
<3-3,Raj>Maybe Jughead's a Terminator.

77
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,960
<3-5,Howard>斯图尔特
<3-5,Howard>Hey, Stuart.

78
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,160
<3-6,Stuart>你们俩有认识玩音乐的人吗
<3-6,Stuart>Do you guys know any musicians?

79
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,120
<3-7,Howard>怎么了
<3-7,Howard>Why?

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,300
<3-8,Stuart>我在想如果店里面
<3-8,Stuart>I was thinking it might be cool

81
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,640
<3-8,Stuart>每周有几天有乐队现场演出
<3-8,Stuart>to have live music here a few nights a week.

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,290
<3-8,Stuart>就是让店里更有
<3-8,Stuart>You know, give this place more

83
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,740
<3-8,Stuart>"还没倒闭"感一点
<3-8,Stuart>of a "staying in business" vibe.

84
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,400
<3-9,Howard>你想要哪一类的音乐
<3-9,Howard>What kind of music are you thinking of?

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
<3-10,Stuart>我什么音乐都喜欢
<3-10,Stuart>I like all kinds of music,

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000
<3-10,Stuart>但最喜欢的是"免费"那一类
<3-10,Stuart>but my favorite genre is free.

87
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,360
<3-11,Raj>我们总说要搞个乐队
<3-11,Raj>Hey, we've always talked about playing together.

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,290
<3-12,Howard>这应该挺有意思
<3-12,Howard>Well, it could be fun

89
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,060
<3-12,Howard>搞个美声乐团之类的
<3-12,Howard>to try a little acoustic thing.

90
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,100
<3-13,Raj>我们也可以玩科谣啊
<3-13,Raj>Oh, we could play "filk" music.

91
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,370
<3-14,Stuart>那是什么
<3-14,Stuart>What's that?

92
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,820
<3-15,Raj>其实这种音乐已存在挺久了
<3-15,Raj>It's been around for years.

93
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,630
<3-15,Raj>就是民谣音乐  但歌曲是科幻/幻想主题
<3-15,Raj>It's like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.

94
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,520
<3-16,Stuart>我喜欢
<3-16,Stuart>I like it.

95
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,730
<3-16,Stuart>听起来就像是
<3-16,Stuart>It sounds exactly like something

96
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,310
<3-16,Stuart>我不用担心会要花钱的音乐
<3-16,Stuart>I shouldn't be expected to pay for.

97
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,600
<3-17,Raj>兄弟  如果要玩这个
<3-17,Raj>Dude, if we do this,

98
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,450
<3-17,Raj>那得取个屌炸天的团名
<3-17,Raj>we're gonna need a cool band name.

99
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,910
<3-18,Howard>其实我心里
<3-18,Howard>You know, I've actually

<3-18,Howard>有个深藏已久的乐队名
<3-18,Howard>had one I've been sitting on for years.

220
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,310
<6-12,Sheldon>数年前我没有任何情感

221
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,880
<6-12,Sheldon>我想说那时的我更快乐
<6-12,Sheldon>I'd say it was a happier time,

222
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,210
<6-12,Sheldon>但当时我没有情感  所以谁知道呢
<6-12,Sheldon>but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?

223
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,040
<6-13,Amy>我不知道该怎么帮你
<6-13,Amy>I don't know how to help you.

224
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,220
<6-13,Amy>情感是生活的一部分
<6-13,Amy>You know, feelings are a part of life.

225

<6-14,Sheldon>you all poisoned me with emotions.

228
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,950
<6-14,Sheldon>当时的我就像铁皮人  对现状非常满足
<6-14,Sheldon>I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content

229
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,790
<6-14,Sheldon>直到邪恶的巫师给了他一颗心
<6-14,Sheldon>until that evil Wizard gave him a heart.

230
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
<6-15,Amy>我觉得《绿野仙踪》的中心思想不是这样
<6-15,Amy>I don't think that was the point of the movie.

231
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,640
<6-16,Sheldon>好吧  那我就像木偶皮诺曹
<6-16,Sheldon>Fine, then I was like Pinocchio

<7-8,Sheldon>but I realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable,

251
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,450
<7-8,Sheldon>所以就像一个操作系统
<7-8,Sheldon>so, like an operating system,

252
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,490
<7-8,Sheldon>我要把我的人生还原到前一个稳定的版本
<7-8,Sheldon>I'm restoring my life to the last stable version,

253
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,620
<7-8,Sheldon>也就是回到2003年我遇到莱纳德的前一天
<7-8,Sheldon>which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.

254
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,640
<7-9,Leonard>他的意思是不去
<7-9,Leonard>You heard him, no.

255
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,070
<7-10,Penny>等等
<7-10,Penny>Hang on.

256
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,610
<7-10,Penny>你真的认为现在是2003年吗
<7-10,Penny>Wait, you actually think it's 2003?

257
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,720
<7-11,Sheldon>不啊  我像12年前那样生活
<7-11,Sheldon>No, just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago

258
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,330
<7-11,Sheldon>并不代表我有妄想症
<7-11,Sheldon>doesn't mean I'm delusional.

259
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,180
<7-11,Sheldon>而且既然是2003年
<7-11,Sheldon>And since it is 2003,

260
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,490
<7-11,Sheldon>咱俩不认识
<7-11,Sheldon>I don't know who you are,

261
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,410
<7-11,Sheldon>所以请快离开这里
<7-11,Sheldon>so please exit the premises

262
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,040
<7-11,Sheldon>否则我可要用我时髦的翻盖手机报警了
<7-11,Sheldon>before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.

263
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,890
<8-1,Penny>你还好吧
<8-1,Penny>Are you doing okay?

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,510
<8-2,Leonard>还行
<8-2,Leonard>I guess.

265
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,620
<8-2,Leonard>我只是有点担心谢尔顿
<8-2,Leonard>I'm just, you know, worried about Sheldon.

266
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,550
<8-3,Penny>别担心  他是一个30多岁
<8-3,Penny>Well, come on, he's a grown man in his 30s

267
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,370
<8-3,Penny>假装自己是一个20多岁的成年人
<8-3,Penny>pretending to be a grown man in his 20s.

268
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,570
<8-3,Penny>没事的
<8-3,Penny>He's fine.

269
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,100
<8-4,Leonard>但愿吧
<8-4,Leonard>I hope so.

270
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,900
<8-5,Penny>不然你能干嘛  搬回去跟他住吗
<8-5,Penny>What else can you do? Move back in with him?

271
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,360
<8-6,Leonard>当然不是  我只是觉得内疚
<8-6,Leonard>No, of course not. I-I just feel bad.

272
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,750
<8-7,Penny>我也是啊
<8-7,Penny>Well, so do I,

273
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,180
<8-7,Penny>可你不想跟自己老婆住在一起吗
<8-7,Penny>but don't you want to live with your wife

274
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,720
<8-7,Penny>想怎么设恒温器就怎么设
<8-7,Penny>and set the thermostat to whatever you want

275
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,390
<8-7,Penny>还有让你的身体告诉你
<8-7,Penny>and have your body tell you

276
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,120
<8-7,Penny>何时想上厕所了才去
<8-7,Penny>when it's time to go to the bathroom,

277
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,460
<8-7,Penny>而不是每天早上
<8-7,Penny>you know, not a schedule slipped

278
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,400
<8-7,Penny>一张从你门缝塞进来的时间表
<8-7,Penny>underneath your door every morning?

279
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,920
<8-8,Leonard>我挺喜欢那上面的天气预报
<8-8,Leonard>I did like that he had the weather on it.

280
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,370
<8-9,Penny>相信我  这么做是正确的
<8-9,Penny>Trust me, this is the right thing.

281
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,510
<8-9,Penny>我知道
<8-9,Penny>I know.

282
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,030
<8-10,Leonard>而且我们又不是抛弃他
<8-10,Leonard>And it's not like we're abandoning him.

283
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,150
<8-10,Leonard>再说了
<8-10,Leonard>Plus,

284
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,580
<8-10,Leonard>我们随时可以视频聊天啊
<8-10,Leonard>we can FaceTime him whenever we want,

285
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,520
<8-10,Leonard>等他所在的那个宇宙发明了iPhone就行了
<8-10,Leonard>you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.

286
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,190
<9-1,Bernadette>真不敢相信谢尔顿让你当他的室友
<9-1,Bernadette>I can't believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.

287
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,730
<9-2,Amy>真不敢相信他查我的信用记录
<9-2,Amy>I can't believe he ran my credit.

288
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,470
<9-3,Bernadette>如果你愿意接纳一个很棒的室友
<9-3,Bernadette>Hey, if you're open to living with someone great,

289
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,380
<9-3,Bernadette>我给你一千块把斯尔图特带走
<9-3,Bernadette>I'll give you $1,000 to take Stuart.

290
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,060
<9-4,Amy>你当时带他回家时
<9-4,Amy>You really should've gone on the Internet

291
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,580
<9-4,Amy>真应该上网查查那种生物
<9-4,Amy>and checked how long that kind of thing lives

292
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,830
<9-4,Amy>能存活多久
<9-4,Amy>before you got one.

293
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,350
<9-5,Bernadette>抱歉
<9-5,Bernadette>I'm sorry.

294
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,360
<9-5,Bernadette>我只是以为你的生活
<9-5,Bernadette>I just thought you might have

295
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,290
<9-5,Bernadette>可能有个苍白怪胎的洞需要补上
<9-5,Bernadette>a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.

296
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,840
<9-6,Amy>我知道谢尔顿为人古怪
<9-6,Amy>Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky,

297
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,570
<9-6,Amy>但他同时聪明又有见解
<9-6,Amy>but he's also brilliant and insightful.

298
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,650
<9-6,Amy>我觉得叫他怪胎不太公平吧
<9-6,Amy>I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.

299
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,650
<10-1,Sheldon>你好  2003年
<10-1,Sheldon>Hello, 2003!

300
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,060
<10-2,Leonard>我们给你打包了泰国菜
<10-2,Leonard>Hey, we brought you Thai.

301
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,990
<10-2,Leonard>东西都哪去了
<10-2,Leonard>Where is everything?

302
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,050
<10-3,Sheldon>于我来说  是在我的未来
<10-3,Sheldon>In my present, it's in the future.

303
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,740
<10-3,Sheldon>于你来说  是在你的卧室
<10-3,Sheldon>In your present, it's been crammed in the bedroom

304
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,960
<10-3,Sheldon>我让那位在家具店停车场认识的
<10-3,Sheldon>by an enterprising young man

305
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,670
<10-3,Sheldon>有干劲的年轻人全塞进去了
<10-3,Sheldon>I met in The Home Depot parking lot.

306
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,440
<10-4,Leonard>我知道你在干什么
<10-4,Leonard>I know what you're doing.

307
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,270
<10-4,Leonard>你想引起我们的注意  让我们对你心生内疚
<10-4,Leonard>You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you,

308
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,640
<10-4,Leonard>但这没有用
<10-4,Leonard>but it's not happening.

309
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,780
<10-5,Sheldon>不  我是在努力搞清
<10-5,Sheldon>No, what I'm doing is trying to figure out

310
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,350
<10-5,Sheldon>自己该如何生活  因为大家都离我而去
<10-5,Sheldon>how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.

311
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,780
<10-6,Leonard>你歇歇吧  我们就住在对门
<10-6,Leonard>Will you knock it off? We're across the hall.

312
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,140
<10-7,Sheldon>用现在孩子们的说法"懒得鸟你"
<10-7,Sheldon>As the kids are saying today, "Talk to the hand."

313
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,230
<10-8,Penny>现在孩子们不这么说
<10-8,Penny>They're not saying that.

314
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,310
<10-9,Sheldon>2003年的时候是这么说
<10-9,Sheldon>They are in 2003.

315
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,670
<10-10,Penny>不  他们真不这么说
<10-10,Penny>No, they're really not.

321
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,340
<11-2,Emily>那颗石头其实是颗大滚石
<11-2,Emily>Runs from stones means that-that big boulder,

322
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,970

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,130

329
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,490
<11-7,Raj>可爱  这不可爱
<11-7,Raj>Cute? It's not cute.

330
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,800
<11-7,Raj>可爱是形容儿童扮成蔬菜
<11-7,Raj>Cute is children dressed as vegetables.

331
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,320
<11-8,Emily>好吧  不可爱
<11-8,Emily>Okay, fine, it's not cute.

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,750
<11-9,Raj>你就实话实说  你不喜欢
<11-9,Raj>Just be honest. You don't like it.

333
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,550
<11-10,Emily>我没有这么说
<11-10,Emily>I didn't say that.

334
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,880
<11-10,Emily>我只是喜欢可以跳舞的音乐
<11-10,Emily>I-I just like music you can dance to.

335
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,140
<11-10,Emily>这首歌也可以跳舞啊

<11-10,Emily>I'm telling you, dude, the song has no groove.

341
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,750
<12-1,Raj>不能随着跳舞
<12-1,Raj>You can't dance to it.

342
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,760
<12-2,Howard>谁在乎啊
<12-2,Howard>Who cares?

343
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,640
<12-2,Howard>我还以为月球足迹乐队
<12-2,Howard>I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon

344
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,350
<12-2,Howard>主要是写出能让人思考的歌
<12-2,Howard>was to write songs that make people think.

345
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,800
<12-3,Raj>两者皆可顾啊
<12-3,Raj>You can do both,

346
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,130
<12-3,Raj>就像迈克·杰克逊的《比莉·珍》
<12-3,Raj>like Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean."

347
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,990
<12-3,Raj>你会一边跳舞一边思考
<12-3,Raj>While you're dancing you're thinking, like,

348
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,780
<12-3,Raj>"靠  歌词唱的小孩到底是谁的"
<12-3,Raj>"Darn it, whose baby is it?"

349
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,920
<12-4,Howard>你这想法都打哪儿来的
<12-4,Howard>Where's this coming from?

350
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,200
<12-4,Howard>几个小时前  我们都很爱这首歌
<12-4,Howard>A few hours ago, we both loved this song.

351
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,470
<12-5,Raj>我还是爱啊
<12-5,Raj>I still love it.

352
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,070
<12-5,Raj>只是认为它有进步的空间而已
<12-5,Raj>I just think there's room for improvement.

353
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,550
<12-6,Howard>你唱给艾米丽听了  对不对
<12-6,Howard>You played it for Emily, didn't you?

354
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,820
<12-7,Raj>对  那又怎样
<12-7,Raj>Yeah, so what?

355
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,960
<12-8,Howard>你这个妻管严
<12-8,Howard>You are such a wimp.

356
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,720
<12-8,Howard>她不喜欢  你就也不喜欢了
<12-8,Howard>She didn't like it, now you don't like it.

357
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,760
<12-9,Raj>不  只是我这个音乐人在进步
<12-9,Raj>No, no. I'm just evolving as a musician.

358
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,040
<12-9,Raj>而你却停在过去止步不前
<12-9,Raj>You're the one who's stuck in the past.

359
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,320
<12-10,Howard>你说的过去就是一顿午饭前
<12-10,Howard>The past was lunch!

360
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,090
<12-10,Howard>你知道这到底是怎么回事吗
<12-10,Howard>You know what's really happening here?

361
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,270
<12-10,Howard>你的女友在破坏我们的乐队
<12-10,Howard>Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.

362
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,380
<12-11,Raj>这事跟她无关
<12-11,Raj>She has nothing to do with this.

363
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,640
<12-11,Raj>我有我自己的想法
<12-11,Raj>I am my own man.

364
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,290
<12-12,Howard>拜托吧  你的大脑就属于
<12-12,Howard>Oh, please. Your brain belongs

365
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,180
<12-12,Howard>任何一个愿意跟你上床的人
<12-12,Howard>to whoever's willing to sleep with you.

366
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,690
<12-13,Raj>-才不是呢  -真的吗
<12-13,Raj>- That is so not true. - Really?

367
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,160
<12-14,Howard>还记得你差点为了那叫瑞秋的姑娘
<12-14,Howard>Remember when you were gonna get circumcised

368
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,090
<12-14,Howard>去割包皮吗
<12-14,Howard>for Rachel Bernstein?

369
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,050
<12-15,Raj>那个跟瑞秋没关系
<12-15,Raj>That had nothing to do with Rachel.

370
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,520
<12-15,Raj>是我因为包皮被拉链夹到  一时冲动的想法
<12-15,Raj>It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.

371
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,250
<12-16,Howard>我受够了
<12-16,Howard>I don't need this.

372
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,430
<12-16,Howard>我要退出乐队
<12-16,Howard>I'm quitting the band!

373
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,500
<12-17,Raj>好  我也退
<12-17,Raj>Fine, I quit, too!

374
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,970
<12-18,Howard>那你就滚出我家
<12-18,Howard>Then get out of my house!

375
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,750
<12-19,Raj>巴不得呢
<12-19,Raj>With pleasure!

376
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,230
<12-20,Howard>拉杰  等等
<12-20,Howard>Raj, wait.

377
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,400
<12-21,Raj>怎么这么久才叫人家
<12-21,Raj>What took you so long?

378
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,850
<13-1,Leonard>兄弟  我知道我搬去跟佩妮住
<13-1,Leonard>Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny

379
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,990
<13-1,Leonard>感觉好像变化很大
<13-1,Leonard>feels like a big change,

380
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,940
<13-1,Leonard>但其实并没有
<13-1,Leonard>but it's not.

381
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,480
<13-2,Sheldon>你怎么能这么说
<13-2,Sheldon>How can you say that?

382
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,830
<13-2,Sheldon>艾米离开了
<13-2,Sheldon>Amy's gone,

383
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,160
<13-2,Sheldon>现在你们俩也结婚了
<13-2,Sheldon>and you two are married now,

384
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,690
<13-2,Sheldon>你们的离开也只剩时间问题了
<13-2,Sheldon>so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.

385
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,290
<13-3,Penny>好了  你不知道未来会怎么样
<13-3,Penny>Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.

386
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,460
<13-3,Penny>不  我知道
<13-3,Penny>No, I do.

387
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,180
<13-4,Sheldon>最终你们会需要更多的空间
<13-4,Sheldon>Eventually you'll want more space,

388
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,710
<13-4,Sheldon>然后会搬进一栋房子里
<13-4,Sheldon>and you'll move into a house,

389
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,730
<13-4,Sheldon>一起吃晚餐的次数从一周几次
<13-4,Sheldon>and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week,

390
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,680
<13-4,Sheldon>变成了一个月几次
<13-4,Sheldon>it'll only be a couple of times a month,

391
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,870
<13-4,Sheldon>之后就只有特殊日子才会相聚
<13-4,Sheldon>and then it'll only be on special occasions,

392
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,870
<13-4,Sheldon>比如伯纳黛特要跟沃罗威茨离婚
<13-4,Sheldon>like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz.

393
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,700
<13-4,Sheldon>或者比如
<13-4,Sheldon>Or-or-or like

394
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,290
<13-4,Sheldon>库萨帕里的诡异女友
<13-4,Sheldon>when Koothrappali's weird girlfriend

395
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,360
<13-4,Sheldon>终于讲出把他的尸体埋哪了
<13-4,Sheldon>admits where she buried his body.

396
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,830
<13-4,Sheldon>或者艾米的婚礼
<13-4,Sheldon>Or Amy's wedding,

397
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,480
<13-4,Sheldon>她嫁给一个比我更好的人
<13-4,Sheldon>where she's marrying someone better than me.

398
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,730
<13-5,Penny>好吧  听着
<13-5,Penny>Okay, look,

399
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,310
<13-5,Penny>我们不需要操之过急
<13-5,Penny>we don't need to rush into anything.

400
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,490
<13-5,Penny>好吗
<13-5,Penny>All right?

401
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,860
<13-5,Penny>或者莱纳德不用搬去跟我住
<13-5,Penny>Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me,

402
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,340
<13-5,Penny>我们维持现状就好了
<13-5,Penny>we just leave things the way they are,

403
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,070
<13-5,Penny>就是
<13-5,Penny>and...

404
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,090
<13-5,Penny>有时我们在那边睡
<13-5,Penny>sometimes we'll sleep over there,

405
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,750
<13-5,Penny>有时我们在这边睡
<13-5,Penny>and sometimes we'll sleep over here.

406
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,710
<13-6,Sheldon>大多数都要在这边
<13-6,Sheldon>But mostly here.

407
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,060
<13-7,Penny>当然
<13-7,Penny>Sure.

408
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,230
<13-8,Leonard>那你在餐厅说的怎么办
<13-8,Leonard>W-W-What about what you said in the restaurant?

409
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,140
<13-9,Penny>又不会一直这样
<13-9,Penny>Well, it's not forever.

410
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,350
<13-9,Penny>只是一段时间而已
<13-9,Penny>It's just for a little while.

411
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,110
<13-9,Penny>如果你想  我们也可以把他当成我们的狗
<13-9,Penny>If you want, we can think of him like he's our dog.

412
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,070
<13-9,Penny>可以啊
<13-9,Penny>You can.

413
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,680
<13-10,Sheldon>你们一回家我就开心
<13-10,Sheldon>I'm happy when you come home.

414
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,310
<13-10,Sheldon>我还害怕烟花
<13-10,Sheldon>And I'm scared of fireworks.

415
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,390
<13-10,Sheldon>顺便说一下  国庆节都必须在这睡
<13-10,Sheldon>And by the way, on July Fourth, we're all sleeping here.

416
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,100
<13-11,Leonard>好的
<13-11,Leonard>Fine.

417
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,170
<13-12,Sheldon>好的  太好了
<13-12,Sheldon>All right, great!

<13-12,Sheldon>Just give me one minute,

419
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,840
<13-12,Sheldon>我要着手起草新的室友协议了
<13-12,Sheldon>and I'll get started on a new Roommate Agreement.

420
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,490
<13-12,Sheldon>好

421
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,810
