1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,700
<1-1,Penny>莱纳德  看我的
<1-1,Penny>Hey, Leonard, check this out.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,230
<1-2,Sheldon>莱纳德  她又来了
<1-2,Sheldon>Leonard, she's doing it again.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,860
<1-3,Leonard>我觉得你调戏食物会让谢尔顿郁闷
<1-3,Leonard>I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,300
<1-4,Sheldon>不  应该是她从碗里随便拿起食物
<1-4,Sheldon>No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,830
<1-4,Sheldon>而不顾还要平均分配的问题时
<1-4,Sheldon>from the containers without regard

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,200
<1-4,Sheldon>让谢尔顿很郁闷
<1-4,Sheldon>for its equitable distribution.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,230
<1-4,Sheldon>这就是印度有饥荒的根本原因
<1-4,Sheldon>This is essentially why you have famine in India.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,960
<1-5,Penny>你要我吐回去吗
<1-5,Penny>You want me to put it back?

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,560
<1-6,Sheldon>莱纳德
<1-6,Sheldon>Leonard.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,500
<1-7,Leonard>当你调戏谢尔顿时会让谢尔顿郁闷
<1-7,Leonard>It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,930
<1-8,Howard (arriving)>怎么样啊  我亲爱的呆瓜们
<1-8,Howard (arriving)>What's up, my nerdizzles?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,260
<1-8,Howard (arriving)>拉杰  谢尔顿
<1-8,Howard (arriving)>Raj, Sheldon,

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,200
<1-8,Howard (arriving)>我想将我的女朋友伯纳黛特引见与你们
<1-8,Howard (arriving)>I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,300
<1-10,Howard>你好  莱纳德  佩妮
<1-10,Howard>Hello. Leonard, Penny,

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
<1-10,Howard>你们认识我的女友伯纳黛特的
<1-10,Howard>you know my girlfriend Bernadette.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,360
<1-11,Leonard>-嗯  -嗨
<1-11,Leonard>- Yeah.  - Hey.

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,630
<1-12,Howard>伯纳黛特  跟呆瓜们说绝对的
<1-12,Howard>Bernadette, say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,160
<1-13,Bernadette>我不能这么说
<1-13,Bernadette>I don't think I can.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,860
<1-13,Bernadette>我没有霍华德那种街头痞子风
<1-13,Bernadette>I don't have Howard's street cred.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
<1-14,Howard>我希望这没造成问题
<1-14,Howard>I hope it's all right--

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,300
<1-14,Howard>我跟我的女朋友伯纳黛特说
<1-14,Howard>I told my girlfriend Bernadette

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,830
<1-14,Howard>她可以跟我们共进晚餐
<1-14,Howard>she could join us for dinner.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,830
<1-15,Leonard>当然可以  人多乐趣多
<1-15,Leonard>Sure. The more, the merrier.

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,960
<1-16,Sheldon>不对  这是个错误的对等关系
<1-16,Sheldon>Wa-- no, that's a false equivalency.

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,500
<1-16,Sheldon>人多不等于乐趣多
<1-16,Sheldon>More does not equal merry.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
<1-16,Sheldon>如果这公寓里现在有两千人
<1-16,Sheldon>If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now,

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,560
<1-16,Sheldon>那我们会很开心吗  不  我们会窒息而死
<1-16,Sheldon>would we be celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,760
<1-18,Sheldon>-谢尔顿  -别郁闷我
<1-18,Sheldon>- Sheldon...  - Don't "Sheldon" me.

29
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,100
<1-18,Sheldon>我们定的是五人份  不是六人
<1-18,Sheldon>We ordered for five people, not six.

30
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,630
<1-19,Penny>来不  没事儿的
<1-19,Penny>Oh, come on, it's fine.

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,060
<1-19,Penny>我们全部摊在桌上分享就好  就像家庭聚餐式的
<1-19,Penny>We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.

32
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,430
<1-20,Sheldon>噢  那是  当我们家庭聚餐时
<1-20,Sheldon>Oh, sure. And while we're at it,

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,200
<1-20,Sheldon>为什么不把手背到背后
<1-20,Sheldon>why don't we put our hands behind our backs,

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,660
<1-20,Sheldon>来个老式的进食大赛呢
<1-20,Sheldon>have an old-fashioned eating contest?

35
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,060
<1-21,Leonard>放轻松  没事儿的
<1-21,Leonard>Relax, it'll be fine.

36
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,130
<1-21,Leonard>做吧  你们
<1-21,Leonard>Sit down, you guys.

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,600
<1-22,Everyone>别  别  别
<1-22,Everyone>No! No! No!

38
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,500
<1-23,Bernadette>怎么了
<1-23,Bernadette>What?!

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,260
<1-24,Penny>对了  你不能坐那儿
<1-24,Penny>Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

40
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,200
<1-25,Bernadette>为什么不能
<1-25,Bernadette>Why not?

41
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,760
<1-26,Leonard>那是谢尔顿的专属座位
<1-26,Leonard>That's where Sheldon sits.

42
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,300
<1-27,Bernadette>他不能坐其他地方吗
<1-27,Bernadette>He can't sit somewhere else?

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,460
<1-28,Penny>不  不  不  你看啊  在冬天呢
<1-28,Penny>No, no, no-- you see, in the winter,

44
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,830
<1-28,Penny>这个座位与暖气片的距离足够让他保持温暖
<1-28,Penny>that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm,

45
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,260
<1-28,Penny>但又不会太近以至于出汗
<1-28,Penny>yet not so close that he sweats.

46
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,260
<1-28,Penny>而在夏天  这个位置又正好处在
<1-28,Penny>In the summer, it's directly in the path of

47
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,630
<1-28,Penny>由这个和那个窗口之间对流所产生的微风之中
<1-28,Penny>a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there.

48
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,960
<1-28,Penny>这儿的角度并不是直接面朝电视
<1-28,Penny>It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct,

49
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,430
<1-28,Penny>所以他还能跟所有人交谈
<1-28,Penny>so he can still talk to everybody,

50
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,200
<1-28,Penny>同时又不会太偏导致画面失真
<1-28,Penny>yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,500
<1-29,Sheldon>看来你还是有那么点指望的嘛
<1-29,Sheldon>Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

52
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,710
<1-29,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-29,Sheldon>第三季第十集

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
<2-1,Bernadette>喔  我喜欢你的鞋子
<2-1,Bernadette>Ooh, I love your shoes.

54
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,560
<2-2,Penny>谢谢
<2-2,Penny>Oh, thanks.

55
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,760
<2-2,Penny>很可爱  不是吗
<2-2,Penny>They are cute, aren't they?

56
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,660
<2-4,Penny>-你在哪儿买到的  -实惠鞋店
<2-4,Penny>- Where'd you get them?  - Shoes for Less.

57
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,100
<2-5,Bernadette>我正有此意要去那儿
<2-5,Bernadette>I've been meaning to go over there.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,300
<2-6,Penny>东西很多  价格也便宜
<2-6,Penny>Oh, great selection, great prices.

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,330
<2-7,Sheldon>我娘说的对  确实有地狱
<2-7,Sheldon>My mother was right. Hell is real.

60
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,500
<2-8,Howard>别这样  谢尔顿
<2-8,Howard>Come on, Sheldon.

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,360
<2-8,Howard>让妇女们聊吧
<2-8,Howard>Let the womenfolk chat.

62
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,300
<2-9,Penny>妇女
<2-9,Penny>Womenfolk?

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,730
<2-10,Howard>少女
<2-10,Howard>Gals?

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,860
<2-10,Howard>妞儿
<2-10,Howard>Chicks?

65
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,960
<2-10,Howard>有子宫的美国人
<2-10,Howard>Utero-Americans?

66
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,230
<2-11,Penny>吃你的饭吧
<2-11,Penny>Just eat your dinner.

67
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,960
<2-12,Bernadette>别太跟他较真儿
<2-12,Bernadette>Don't take him too seriously.

68
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,730
<2-12,Bernadette>他说的很多话本是故意为了幽默一下的
<2-12,Bernadette>A lot of what he says is intended as humor.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
<2-13,Penny>是啊  但我一点也不觉得有趣
<2-13,Penny>Yeah, well, I don't think it's very funny.

70
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,660
<2-14,Bernadette>我也是  但是我一笑他就灿烂了
<2-14,Bernadette>Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.

71
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,600
<2-15,Penny>霍华德  不能让她跑了
<2-15,Penny>Howard, never let her go.

72
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,460
<2-16,Bernadette>莱纳德  霍华德说你正在进行
<2-16,Bernadette>So, Leonard, Howard says you're working on

73
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,160
<2-16,Bernadette>一些量子力学的基本测试
<2-16,Bernadette>fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

74
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,200
<2-17,Leonard>没错
<2-17,Leonard>I am.

75
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,730
<2-17,Leonard>你对物理感兴趣吗
<2-17,Leonard>Are you interested in physics?

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,100
<2-18,Bernadette>我觉得很很吸引人
<2-18,Bernadette>Oh, I find it fascinating.

77
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,530
<2-18,Bernadette>如果我没有选择微生物学的话
<2-18,Bernadette>If I hadn't gone into microbiology,

78
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,260
<2-18,Bernadette>我也许就会进军物理了
<2-18,Bernadette>I probably would have gone into physics.

79
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,200
<2-18,Bernadette>或者冰舞
<2-18,Bernadette>Or ice dancing.

80
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,360
<2-19,Leonard>事实上  我对于阿哈伦诺夫-博姆的
<2-19,Leonard>Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm

81
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,860
<2-19,Leonard>量子干涉效应实验已经到达了一个很有趣的阶段
<2-19,Leonard>quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point.

82
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,360
<2-19,Leonard>现在  我们正在测试基于电势的
<2-19,Leonard>Right now, we're testing the phase shift

83
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,760
<2-19,Leonard>相位偏移
<2-19,Leonard>due to an electric potential.

84
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,900
<2-20,Bernadette>真是太棒了
<2-20,Bernadette>That's amazing.

85
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,000
<2-21,Sheldon>那是  莱纳德的工作几乎就跟
<2-21,Sheldon>Yes. Leonard's work is nearly as amazing

86
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,230
<2-21,Sheldon>三年级小学生用湿毛巾种青豆一样棒
<2-21,Sheldon>as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.

87
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,660
<2-21,Sheldon>虽然我很欣赏你的  "喔  又损人了"
<2-21,Sheldon>While I appreciate the "Oh, snap,"

88
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,400
<2-21,Sheldon>但你那温湿的口气飘进我的耳中令我很不舒服
<2-21,Sheldon>I'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.

89
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,530
<2-22,Bernadette>你会用
<2-22,Bernadette>Are you going to try

90
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,800
<2-22,Bernadette>穿隧结合来设定电压吗
<2-22,Bernadette>to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?

91
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,900
<2-23,Leonard>是的
<2-23,Leonard>Yes, I am.

92
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,930
<2-23,Leonard>你要看我笔记本上的模拟情况吗
<2-23,Leonard>You want to see a simulation on my laptop?

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,460
<2-24,Bernadette>好啊  给我看看
<2-24,Bernadette>Oh, yeah, show me.

94
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,830
<2-24,Bernadette>在微生物学中  我做过的最激动人心的事情
<2-24,Bernadette>In microbiology, the most exciting thing

95
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,060
<2-24,Bernadette>也就是跟酵母玩玩
<2-24,Bernadette>I get to work with is yeast.

96
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,900
<2-25,Sheldon>霍华德
<2-25,Sheldon>Howard?

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,930
<2-26,Howard>怎么了
<2-26,Howard>Yeah?

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,630
<2-27,Sheldon>你的鞋子真漂亮
<2-27,Sheldon>Your shoes are delightful.

99
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,360
<2-27,Sheldon>你在哪儿买的
<2-27,Sheldon>Where did you get them?

100
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,260
<2-28,Howard>什么
<2-28,Howard>What?

101
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,600
<2-29,Sheldon>逗你玩儿  我才不关心呢
<2-29,Sheldon>Bazinga. I don't care.

102
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,100
<3-1,Raj>哈  吃灰吧你
<3-1,Raj>Ha! Eat my dust,

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
<3-1,Raj>万年不变的古板水管工
<3-1,Raj>racially stereotypical plumber.

104
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,830
<3-2,Sheldon>这不公平
<3-2,Sheldon>That's not fair.

105
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,560
<3-2,Sheldon>我被一棵树卡住了
<3-2,Sheldon>I got stuck behind a tree.

106
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,460
<3-3,Raj>外加一只母牛和企鹅
<3-3,Raj>And a cow and a penguin.

107
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,400
<3-3,Raj>认了吧  兄弟
<3-3,Raj>Face it, dude,

108
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,900
<3-3,Raj>不管是现实的车还是虚拟的卡通车
<3-3,Raj>whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car,

109
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,200
<3-3,Raj>你都不能驾驭
<3-3,Raj>you can't drive.

110
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,960
<3-4,Sheldon>只需要点练习而已
<3-4,Sheldon>Just need a little more practice.

111
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,430
<3-5,Raj>你需要的是金手指  驾驶技巧和一盏神灯
<3-5,Raj>What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie

112
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,930
<3-5,Raj>来帮马里奥赛车小废柴实现愿望
<3-5,Raj>who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.

113
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,000
<3-6,Penny (knocking and entering)>谢尔顿  我能跟你说两句话吗
<3-6,Penny (knocking and entering)>Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,630
<3-7,Sheldon>这跟鞋没关系  对吧
<3-7,Sheldon>It's not about shoes, is it?

115
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,800
<3-7,Sheldon>我不想再聊鞋子了
<3-7,Sheldon>I don't think I could go through that again.

116
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,300
<3-8,Penny>跟鞋子无关
<3-8,Penny>It's not about shoes.

117
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,560
<3-9,Sheldon>那就说吧
<3-9,Sheldon>Then speak.

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,300
<3-10,Penny>我们能私下谈吗
<3-10,Penny>Um, actually, can we do it in private?

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,130
<3-10,Penny>好吧
<3-10,Penny>All right.

120
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,660
<3-11,Sheldon>走开
<3-11,Sheldon>Go away.

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,100
<3-11,Sheldon>我知道很无礼  但她要私下谈
<3-11,Sheldon>I agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,230
<3-12,Penny>谢谢  拉杰
<3-12,Penny>Thanks, Raj.

123
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,030
<3-12,Penny>事情是这样的
<3-12,Penny>Okay, so here's the thing:

124
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,660
<3-12,Penny>我想请你教我一点物理学
<3-12,Penny>I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?

125
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,400
<3-12,Penny>一点物理学
<3-12,Penny>A little physics?

126
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,800
<3-13,Sheldon>没有这个说法
<3-13,Sheldon>There's no such thing.

127
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,800
<3-13,Sheldon>物理学包含整个宇宙
<3-13,Sheldon>Physics encompasses the entire universe,

128
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,400
<3-13,Sheldon>从量子粒子到超新星
<3-13,Sheldon>from quantum particles to supernovas,

129
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,660
<3-13,Sheldon>从自旋电子到旋转星系
<3-13,Sheldon>from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.

130
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,660
<3-14,Penny>行
<3-14,Penny>Yeah, okay, cool.

131
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,900
<3-14,Penny>不用说得像广播特别报导一样
<3-14,Penny>I don't need the PBS special.

132
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,330
<3-14,Penny>只要了解到
<3-14,Penny>I just want to know enough

133
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,430
<3-14,Penny>能和莱纳德谈他的工作就行
<3-14,Penny>so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

134
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,860
<3-14,Penny>就像伯纳黛特那样
<3-14,Penny>You know, like Bernadette does.

135
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,460
<3-15,Sheldon>干嘛不叫莱纳德教你
<3-15,Sheldon>Why can't Leonard teach you?

136
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,000
<3-16,Penny>我想给他个惊喜
<3-16,Penny>'Cause I want to surprise him.

137
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,100
<3-17,Sheldon>就不能以其他方式给他惊喜吗
<3-17,Sheldon>Can't you surprise him in some other way?

138
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,100
<3-17,Sheldon>比如  你要是打扫一下房间
<3-17,Sheldon>For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,330
<3-17,Sheldon>我肯定他又惊又喜
<3-17,Sheldon>if you cleaned your apartment.

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,000
<3-18,Penny>拜托  谢尔顿  这对我很重要
<3-18,Penny>Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.

141
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,130
<3-18,Penny>佩妮
<3-18,Penny>Penny,

142
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,530
<3-19,Sheldon>教你可是艰巨的任务
<3-19,Sheldon>this would be a massive undertaking,

143
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,360
<3-19,Sheldon>我的时间既有限又宝贵呢
<3-19,Sheldon>and my time is both limited and valuable.

144
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,900
<3-20,Penny>你整天都坐着玩电子游戏呢
<3-20,Penny>You're sitting here playing video games all day.

145
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,460
<3-21,Sheldon>被你说中了
<3-21,Sheldon>Okay, point.

146
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,800
<3-21,Sheldon>你学了哪些基础知识
<3-21,Sheldon>What sort of foundation do you have?

147
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,230
<3-21,Sheldon>学校教过什么科学课吗
<3-21,Sheldon>Did you take any science classes in school?

148
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,400
<3-22,Penny>有  我做过青蛙的实验
<3-22,Penny>Sure. I did the one with the frogs.

149
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,230
<3-23,Sheldon>青蛙的实验
<3-23,Sheldon>The one with the frogs.

150
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,630
<3-24,Penny>对  其实挺好玩的
<3-24,Penny>Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool.

151
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,730
<3-24,Penny>很多女生都吐了  但我把小青蛙像鹿一样宰了
<3-24,Penny>A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.

152
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,330
<3-25,Sheldon>抱歉  佩妮
<3-25,Sheldon>I'm sorry, Penny.

153
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,700
<3-25,Sheldon>恕我无能为力
<3-25,Sheldon>I don't think so.

154
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,860
<3-25,Sheldon>别这样嘛
<3-25,Sheldon>Oh, come on!

155
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,660
<3-26,Penny>你这么聪明  就当挑战一下
<3-26,Penny>A smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge.

156
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,160
<3-26,Penny>当成实验来做嘛
<3-26,Penny>You can make it like an experiment.

157
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,560
<3-27,Sheldon>有意思
<3-27,Sheldon>Interesting.

158
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,900
<3-27,Sheldon>既然别人能教
<3-27,Sheldon>I suppose if someone could teach sign language

159
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,830
<3-27,Sheldon>KoKo大猩猩学手语
<3-27,Sheldon>to KoKo the gorilla...

160
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,260
<3-27,Sheldon>我也能教你基本物理学
<3-27,Sheldon>I could teach you some rudimentary physics.

161
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,260
<3-27,Sheldon>太好了
<3-27,Sheldon>Great!

162
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,500
<3-28,Penny>虽然有点侮辱人  但很好
<3-28,Penny>It's a little insulting, but great.

163
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,500
<3-28,Penny>我就做KoKo吧
<3-28,Penny>I'll be KoKo.

164
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,700
<3-29,Sheldon>不见得吧
<3-29,Sheldon>Not likely.

165
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,630
<3-29,Sheldon>KoKo学会了超过两千个单词
<3-29,Sheldon>KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words,

166
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,330
<3-29,Sheldon>没有一个跟鞋子有关呢
<3-29,Sheldon>not one of which had anything to do with shoes.

167
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,900
<4-1,Howard>伙计们好
<4-1,Howard>Hey, fellas.

168
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,030
<4-1,Howard>这是在下的女友伯纳黛特
<4-1,Howard>This is my girlfriend Bernadette.

169
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,760
<4-1,Howard>在下的女友伯纳黛特
<4-1,Howard>My girlfriend Bernadette.

170
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,230
<4-2,Bernadette>他们都是谁
<4-2,Bernadette>Who are all those people?

171
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,400
<4-3,Howard>不知道
<4-3,Howard>Have no idea.

172
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,430
<4-4,Bernadette>好啊  莱纳德
<4-4,Bernadette>Hey, Leonard.

173
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,860
<4-5,Leonard>好  瞧瞧
<4-5,Leonard>Hi. Hey, look,

174
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,530
<4-5,Leonard>这不是霍华德的女友伯纳黛特嘛
<4-5,Leonard>it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.

175
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,030
<4-6,Howard>带这位小美人逛逛这老盐矿
<4-6,Howard>Thought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.

176
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,600
<4-7,Bernadette>他说的不是盐矿
<4-7,Bernadette>He doesn't mean salt mines.

177
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,260
<4-7,Bernadette>他说的是工作地点
<4-7,Bernadette>He means where he works.

178
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,760
<4-8,Leonard>对  我知道
<4-8,Leonard>Yeah, no, I got it.

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,530
<4-9,Bernadette>你的实验进展如何
<4-9,Bernadette>So, how's your experiment going?

180
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,860
<4-10,Leonard>很顺利
<4-10,Leonard>Ah, terrific.

181
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,260
<4-10,Leonard>我们正在准备电子加速器
<4-10,Leonard>We're getting the electron accelerator set up.

182
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,200
<4-10,Leonard>后天就能准备好
<4-10,Leonard>We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.

183
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,160
<4-11,Bernadette>真想见识一下
<4-11,Bernadette>Boy, I'd love to see that.

184
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,300
<4-12,Leonard>欢迎你来
<4-12,Leonard>You're welcome to come.

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,460
<4-13,Bernadette>真的吗  太好了
<4-13,Bernadette>Really? Oh, that'd be great.

186
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,260
<4-13,Bernadette>多兴奋啊
<4-13,Bernadette>How exciting is that?

187
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,160
<4-14,Howard>简直就像七月过光明节一样
<4-14,Howard>Like Hanukkah in July.

188
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,230
<4-15,Bernadette>七月有光明节吗
<4-15,Bernadette>Do they have that?

189
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,730
<4-16,Howard>没有
<4-16,Howard>No.

190
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,660
<4-17,Bernadette>又被你糊弄了
<4-17,Bernadette>You got me again.

191
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,100
<4-17,Bernadette>这不是脱脂酸奶
<4-17,Bernadette>This isn't non-fat yogurt.

192
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,800
<4-17,Bernadette>简直全是脂肪
<4-17,Bernadette>This is fatty fat fat.

193
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,130
<4-17,Bernadette>失陪一下
<4-17,Bernadette>Excuse me.

194
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,460
<4-18,Howard>心肝儿  能帮我拿张餐巾吗

<4-20,Howard>All right, what is your deal?

197
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,230
<4-21,Leonard>你说什么
<4-21,Leonard>Excuse me?

198
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
<4-22,Howard>邀请我女朋友
<4-22,Howard>Inviting my girlfriend

199
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
<4-22,Howard>去看你的电子加速器
<4-22,Howard>to come see your electron accelerator?

200
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,630
<4-23,Leonard>怎么了
<4-23,Leonard>Yeah? So?

201
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,430
<4-24,Howard>你真有两下子
<4-24,Howard>You really are a piece of work.

202
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,560
<4-24,Howard>舞会皇后
<4-24,Howard>It's not enough

203
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,430
<4-24,Howard>被你弄到手还不满意
<4-24,Howard>you get the prom queen, you have to get

204
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,600
<4-24,Howard>你还想抢走陪衬头牌呢
<4-24,Howard>the head of the decorating committee, too?

205
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,700
<4-25,Leonard>你在说什么呢
<4-25,Leonard>What are you talking about?

206
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,460
<4-26,Howard>别跟我装无辜
<4-26,Howard>Don't play innocent with me.

207
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,930
<4-26,Howard>用神奇实验设备勾引女人
<4-26,Howard>I practically invented

208
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,430
<4-26,Howard>这招是我发明的
<4-26,Howard>using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.

209
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,200
<4-27,Leonard>成功过吗
<4-27,Leonard>Has it ever worked?

210
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,560
<4-28,Howard>目前没有  重点不是这个
<4-28,Howard>Not so far, but that's not the point!

211
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,760
<4-29,Leonard>霍华德  别紧张
<4-29,Leonard>Howard, relax.

212
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,500
<4-29,Leonard>我对你女朋友没兴趣
<4-29,Leonard>I'm not interested in your girlfriend.

213
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
<4-30,Howard>最好如此
<4-30,Howard>I hope not.

214
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,830
<4-30,Howard>你不会想跟我瞎搅和
<4-30,Howard>Because you don't want to mess with me.

215
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,960
<4-30,Howard>我可是疯子
<4-30,Howard>I'm crazy.

216
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,060
<4-31,Leonard>我相信你
<4-31,Leonard>I believe you.

217
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,800
<5-1,Sheldon>实验日志  第一篇
<5-1,Sheldon>Research journal, entry one.

218
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,400
<5-1,Sheldon>我准备开展
<5-1,Sheldon>I'm about to embark on one of

219
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,730
<5-1,Sheldon>科学生涯中的巨大挑战之一
<5-1,Sheldon>the great challenges of my scientific career:

220
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,430
<5-1,Sheldon>教佩妮物理学
<5-1,Sheldon>teaching Penny physics.

221
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,830
<5-1,Sheldon>我称之为大猩猩工程
<5-1,Sheldon>I'm calling it Project Gorilla.

222
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,730
<5-2,Penny>好啊  谢尔顿
<5-2,Penny>Hey, Sheldon.

223
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
<5-3,Sheldon>请进  坐吧

224
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,830
<5-3,Sheldon>实验目标已到
<5-3,Sheldon>Subject has arrived.

225
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,160
<5-3,Sheldon>我亲切地欢迎她
<5-3,Sheldon>I've extended a friendly casual greeting.

226
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,760
<5-4,Penny>准备好开始了吗
<5-4,Penny>Ready to get started?

227
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,030
<5-5,Sheldon>稍等
<5-5,Sheldon>One moment.

228
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,700
<5-5,Sheldon>目标气色很好  也很热情
<5-5,Sheldon>Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic.

229
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
<5-5,Sheldon>显然  无知是福
<5-5,Sheldon>Apparently, ignorance is bliss.

230
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,660
<5-5,Sheldon>好吧  我们开始
<5-5,Sheldon>All right, let us begin.

231
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,330
<5-5,Sheldon>你的笔记本呢
<5-5,Sheldon>Where's your notebook?

232
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
<5-6,Penny>我没笔记本
<5-6,Penny>Um, I don't have one.

233
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,900
<5-7,Sheldon>那你咋记笔记
<5-7,Sheldon>How are you going to take notes without a notebook?

234
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,800
<5-8,Penny>还得记笔记吗
<5-8,Penny>I have to take notes?

235
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,100
<5-9,Sheldon>不然你怎么考试
<5-9,Sheldon>How else are you gonna study for the tests?

236
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,460
<5-10,Penny>最好还要考试吗
<5-10,Penny>There's gonna be a test?

237
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,960
<5-10,Penny>可不止一次考试
<5-10,Penny>Test-sss.

238
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,430
<5-10,Penny>给
<5-10,Penny>Here.

239
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,560
<5-11,Sheldon>这是大学规定
<5-11,Sheldon>It's college-ruled.

240
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,300
<5-11,Sheldon>希望没吓着你
<5-11,Sheldon>I hope that's not too intimidating.

241
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,360
<5-12,Penny>多谢你的体贴
<5-12,Penny>Thank you.

242
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,360
<5-12,Penny>不客气
<5-12,Penny>You're welcome.

243
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,260
<5-13,Sheldon>现在开始讲物理学入门
<5-13,Sheldon>Now, Introduction to Physics.

244
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,130
<5-13,Sheldon>什么是物理
<5-13,Sheldon>What is physics?

245
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,130
<5-13,Sheldon>物理这个词来源于古希腊语中的"physika"
<5-13,Sheldon>Physics comes from the ancient Greek word "physika."

246
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,530
<5-13,Sheldon>你该记笔记了
<5-13,Sheldon>It's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes.

247
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,860
<5-13,Sheldon>"Physika"是指自然科学
<5-13,Sheldon>"Physika" means the science of natural things.

248
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,000
<5-13,Sheldon>而就在那遥远的古希腊  我们的旅程开始了
<5-13,Sheldon>And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.

249
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,630
<5-14,Penny>-靠  古希腊  -嘘
<5-14,Penny>- Ancient Greece?!  - Hush.

250
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
<5-15,Sheldon>有问题  先举手
<5-15,Sheldon>If you have questions, raise your hand.

251
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,460
<5-15,Sheldon>那是在大约公元前600年的一个仲夏夜
<5-15,Sheldon>It's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC.

252
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,530
<5-15,Sheldon>当你从集市[古希腊圣贤集会所]购物归来
<5-15,Sheldon>You've finished your shopping at the local market, or Agora...

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,400
<5-15,Sheldon>抬头仰望夜空
<5-15,Sheldon>...And you look up at the night sky.

254
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,100
<5-15,Sheldon>突然  你发现星星在游弋
<5-15,Sheldon>There you notice some of the stars seem to move,

255
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,730
<5-15,Sheldon>于是  你将他们命名为"行星"或"漫游者"
<5-15,Sheldon>So you name them "planetes," or "wanderer".

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,930
<5-19,Sheldon>佩妮同学  有问题吗
<5-19,Sheldon>Yes, Penny?

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,160
<5-16,Penny>这和莱纳德的研究有什么关系
<5-16,Penny>Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?

258
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,600
<5-17,Sheldon>这是一个历时2600年的旅程
<5-17,Sheldon>This is the beginning of a 2,600-year journey

259
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,560
<5-17,Sheldon>我们慢慢讲  不急
<5-17,Sheldon>We're going to take together

260
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,830
<5-17,Sheldon>追溯到古希腊
<5-17,Sheldon>From the ancient Greeks

261
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,400
<5-17,Sheldon>从艾萨克·牛顿到尼尔斯·玻尔[原子理论和量子力学的创始人]
<5-17,Sheldon>Through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr

262
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,100
<5-17,Sheldon>再到埃尔文·薛定谔[创立波动力学]
<5-17,Sheldon>To Erwin Schrodinger

263
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,700
<5-17,Sheldon>再到荷兰研究学派
<5-17,Sheldon>To the Dutch researchers

264
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
<5-17,Sheldon>莱纳德近来就在重复他们的研究呢
<5-17,Sheldon>That Leonard is currently ripping off.

265
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,360
<5-18,Penny>居然有2600年
<5-18,Penny>2,600 years?

266
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,560
<5-19,Sheldon>没错  可能有些许误差
<5-19,Sheldon>Yeah, give or take.

267
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,960
<5-19,Sheldon>正如我之前所说  在那遥远的古希腊
<5-19,Sheldon>As I was saying, it's a warm summer evening

268
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,500
<5-19,Sheldon>一个氤氲的仲夏夜
<5-19,Sheldon>In ancient Greece...

269
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,360
<5-19,Sheldon>怎么了  佩妮同学
<5-19,Sheldon>Yes, Penny?

270
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,200
<5-20,Penny>我要去洗手间
<5-20,Penny>I have to go to the bathroom.

271
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,460
<5-21,Sheldon>你就不能憋一下吗
<5-21,Sheldon>Can't you hold it?

272
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,130
<5-22,Penny>我可憋不了2600年
<5-22,Penny>Not for 2,600 years.

273
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,130
<5-23,Sheldon>大猩猩实验  日志2
<5-23,Sheldon>Project Gorilla, entry two.

274
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,400
<5-23,Sheldon>我被榨干了
<5-23,Sheldon>I am exhausted.

275
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,260
<6-2,Howard>-霍华德  -怎么
<6-2,Howard>- Howard?  - Huh?

276
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,000
<6-3,Bernadette>这个要从前面解开的
<6-3,Bernadette>It unhooks in the front.

277
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,530
<6-4,Howard>难怪啊
<6-4,Howard>Oh, that explains a lot.

278
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,360
<6-5,Howard’s Mother>霍华德  我回来了
<6-5,Howard’s Mother>Howard, I'm home!

279
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,370
<6-6,Howard>整栋楼都听到了
<6-6,Howard>Of course.

280
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,170
<6-7,Howard’s Mother>老年健身取消了
<6-7,Howard’s Mother>Senior fitness was cancelled.

281
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,270
<6-7,Howard’s Mother>我发现原来还真会忘了怎么骑车
<6-7,Howard’s Mother>It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike.

282
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,070
<6-7,Howard’s Mother>我是没啥  但山姆·哈普蒂安摔了个嘴啃泥
<6-7,Howard’s Mother>I'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.

283
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,440
<6-8,Howard>太棒了  娘
<6-8,Howard>That's great, Ma!

284
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,200
<6-9,Howard’s Mother>80多的亚美尼亚老人摔断了半边下巴
<6-9,Howard’s Mother>What's great about an 80-year-old Armenian man

285
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,940
<6-9,Howard’s Mother>有什么可棒的
<6-9,Howard’s Mother>With half his chin scraped off?!

286
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
<6-10,Bernadette>我想我得走了
<6-10,Bernadette>I guess I should go.

287
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,870
<6-11,Howard>不  别动
<6-11,Howard>No, no, don't move.

288
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,970
<6-11,Howard>娘  晚饭我想吃炖羊肉
<6-11,Howard>Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?

289
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,440
<6-12,Howard’s Mother>炖羊肉  那我还得去超市买
<6-12,Howard’s Mother>Lamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket.

290
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,700
<6-13,Howard>帮帮忙啦
<6-13,Howard>Please?

291
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,740
<6-13,Howard>我真的很想吃嘛
<6-13,Howard>I got a real hankering.

292
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,800
<6-14,Howard’s Mother>噢  我最疼我家小屁脸宝贝了
<6-14,Howard’s Mother>Oh, I can't say no to my little tushy face.

293
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,940
<6-14,Howard’s Mother>我很快回来
<6-14,Howard’s Mother>I'll be back soon.

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
<6-15,Howard>多谢啦  娘
<6-15,Howard>Thanks, Ma.

295
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,270
<6-16,Howard’s Mother>你要家常豌豆还是拉素豌豆[豌豆的一种]
<6-16,Howard’s Mother>Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?

296
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,600
<6-17,Howard>平时不都是加拉素豌豆的吗
<6-17,Howard>Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!

297
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,570
<6-18,Howard’s Mother>好吧  你总是说得有理
<6-18,Howard’s Mother>You're right! When you're right, you're right!

298
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,800
<6-18,Howard’s Mother>如果拉素豌豆卖完了咋办
<6-18,Howard’s Mother>What if they're out of the Le Seur?

299
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,870
<6-19,Howard>那就买家常的啊
<6-19,Howard>Then get the regular!

300
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,240
<6-20,Howard’s Mother>好吧  你别冲我吼啊
<6-20,Howard’s Mother>All right! You don't have to yell!

301
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,970
<6-21,Howard>抱歉
<6-21,Howard>Sorry about that.

302
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,170
<6-22,Bernadette (her phone chimes)>我来调成震动
<6-22,Bernadette (her phone chimes)>Let me just put that on vibrate.

303
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,670
<6-23,Howard>我早就调好啦
<6-23,Howard>I'm already on vibrate.

304
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,470
<6-24,Bernadette>这个我可听懂了
<6-24,Bernadette>You know, that one I got.

305
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,470
<6-24,Bernadette>霍华德  你和莱纳德说起我什么了吗
<6-24,Bernadette>Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?

306
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,870
<6-25,Howard>什么意思
<6-25,Howard>Uh, what do you mean?

307
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,000
<6-26,Bernadette>他说我要是明天去看他的实验
<6-26,Bernadette>He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow

308
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,800
<6-26,Bernadette>可能你会感觉不好
<6-26,Bernadette>It might weird you out.

309
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,540
<6-27,Howard>是吗  他这样说吗
<6-27,Howard>Really? He said that?

310
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,540
<6-28,Bernadette>你不是在吃莱纳德的醋吧
<6-28,Bernadette>You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?

311
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,670
<6-29,Howard>我  才没有呢
<6-29,Howard>Me? No.

312
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,100
<6-29,Howard>我只是说  在没和别人商量的情况下
<6-29,Howard>I may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate

313
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,900
<6-29,Howard>邀请别人的女友去看他的实验
<6-29,Howard>To be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment

314
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,570
<6-29,Howard>这样有点不太合适
<6-29,Howard>Without first discussing it with said man.

315
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,000
<6-30,Bernadette>你的意思是  我和莱纳德一起还要经过同意
<6-30,Bernadette>Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?

316
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,940
<6-31,Howard>我可没这么说
<6-31,Howard>I didn't say anything like that.

317
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,340
<6-31,Howard>我是说莱纳德必须经过我同意
<6-31,Howard>I said Leonard has to ask my permission.

318
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,870
<6-31,Howard>拜托  我可不想和我娘共进炖羊肉啊
<6-31,Howard>Come on, I don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother.

319
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,970
<6-31,Howard>可恶  我差点就解开bra了
<6-31,Howard>Damn, I was this close on the bra.

320
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,270
<7-1,Sheldon>记住  牛顿发现亚里士多德的理论是错的
<7-1,Sheldon>Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong

321
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,640
<7-1,Sheldon>运动不需要靠力来维持
<7-1,Sheldon>And force was not necessary to maintain motion.

322
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,770
<7-1,Sheldon>所以  加上a = 9.8平方米每秒
<7-1,Sheldon>So let's plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared

323
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,700
<7-1,Sheldon>我们能得到
<7-1,Sheldon>As "A" and we get

324
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,370
<7-1,Sheldon>万有引力乘以质量
<7-1,Sheldon>Force-- Earth gravity- equals mass times 9.8 meters

325
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,100
<7-1,Sheldon>等于9.8米每秒的平方
<7-1,Sheldon>Per second per second.

326
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,600
<7-1,Sheldon>从而得到ma = mg
<7-1,Sheldon>So we can see that "ma" equals "mg"

327
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,340
<7-1,Sheldon>我们可以推算出什么
<7-1,Sheldon>And what do we know from this?

328
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,900
<7-2,Penny>我们能推算出
<7-2,Penny>Uh, we know that...

329
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,540
<7-2,Penny>牛顿真是个聪明绝顶的小甜饼
<7-2,Penny>...Newton was a really smart cookie.

330
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,070
<7-2,Penny>哇  所以才有了牛顿打滚吗[一种点心  很像驴打滚]
<7-2,Penny>Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?

331
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,100
<7-3,Sheldon>不  牛顿打滚得名于马萨诸塞州的一个小镇
<7-3,Sheldon>No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts.

332
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,770
<7-3,Sheldon>-别光顾着记这个啊  -抱歉
<7-3,Sheldon>- Don't write that down!  - Sorry.

333
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,340
<7-5,Sheldon>好  如果ma = mg  我们可以推算出什么
<7-5,Sheldon>Now, if "ma" equals "mg," what does that imply?

334
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,500
<7-6,Penny>我不知道
<7-6,Penny>I don't know.

335
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,070
<7-7,Sheldon>你怎么可以不知道
<7-7,Sheldon>How can you not know?

336
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,700
<7-7,Sheldon>我都告诉你了啊
<7-7,Sheldon>I just told you.

337
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,170
<7-9,Sheldon>你最近脑子被敲过了吗
<7-9,Sheldon>Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?

338
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,100
<7-8,Penny>你这也太刻薄了吧
<7-8,Penny>Hey! You don't have to be so mean!

339
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,600
<7-8,Penny>抱歉
<7-8,Penny>I'm sorry.

340
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,800
<7-9,Sheldon>你最近脑子被敲过了吗
<7-9,Sheldon>Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?

341
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,170
<7-10,Penny>-你这个老师真是烂透了  -是吗
<7-10,Penny>- No, you just suck at teaching.  - Really?

342
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,870
<7-11,Sheldon>你觉得这两种解释哪个更靠谱点呢
<7-11,Sheldon>Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?

343
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,700
<7-12,Penny>天哪
<7-12,Penny>Oh, God...

344
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,770
<7-12,Penny>谢尔顿  我也很想听懂
<7-12,Penny>Sheldon, I'm trying to understand,

345
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,170
<7-12,Penny>但你说得太快了
<7-12,Penny>but you're going too fast.

346
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,270
<7-12,Penny>能不能倒回去一点
<7-12,Penny>Can you just back up a little bit?

347
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,640
<7-13,Sheldon>好吧
<7-13,Sheldon>All right.

348
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,100
<7-13,Sheldon>在那个古希腊的仲夏夜
<7-13,Sheldon>It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...

349
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,770
<7-14,Penny>别倒回那么多
<7-14,Penny>Not that far back!

350
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,370
<7-14,Penny>好吧
<7-14,Penny>Okay!

351
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,540
<7-15,Sheldon>你到底哪点开始听不懂的
<7-15,Sheldon>At what point did you begin to feel lost?

352
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,700
<7-6,Penny>我不知道
<7-6,Penny>I don't know.

353
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,670
<7-16,Penny>我们抬头仰望星空是在哪里
<7-16,Penny>Where were we looking up at the night sky?

354
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,940
<7-18,Penny>-希腊  -见鬼
<7-18,Penny>- Greece. - Damn it!

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,140
<7-19,Sheldon>用不着灰心
<7-19,Sheldon>There's no need to get frustrated.

356
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,900
<7-19,Sheldon>总有人学得快  有人学得慢
<7-19,Sheldon>People learn at different rates.

357
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,770
<7-19,Sheldon>不像漂浮在真空中的物体  在那里
<7-19,Sheldon>Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which...?

358
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,740
<7-19,Sheldon>ma=mg
<7-19,Sheldon>"ma" equals "mg"...?

359
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,940
<7-20,Penny>平方?
<7-20,Penny>Squared?

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,340
<7-21,Sheldon>不对
<7-21,Sheldon>No.

361
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,800
<7-22,Penny>亚里斯多德
<7-22,Penny>Aristotle?

362
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,300
<7-23,Sheldon>不对
<7-23,Sheldon>No.

363
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,370
<7-24,Penny>等于五
<7-24,Penny>Five?

364
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,000
<7-26,Penny>那我不知道了
<7-26,Penny>Then I don't know.

365
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,340
<7-27,Sheldon>你哭什么
<7-27,Sheldon>Why are you crying?

366
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,840
<7-28,Penny>我哭我自己蠢啊
<7-28,Penny>Because I'm stupid!

367
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,100
<7-29,Sheldon>那也没理由哭啊
<7-29,Sheldon>That's no reason to cry.

368
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,770
<7-29,Sheldon>人只有悲伤的时候才该哭
<7-29,Sheldon>One cries because one is sad.

369
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,140
<7-29,Sheldon>比如说  其他人都太蠢我感到悲伤
<7-29,Sheldon>For example, I cry because others are stupid

370
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,170
<7-29,Sheldon>所以我才哭
<7-29,Sheldon>and it makes me sad.

371
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,640
<7-30,Penny>好了  能不能先不扯这些题外话
<7-30,Penny>Okay, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff

372
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,500
<7-30,Penny>就告诉我莱纳德平常在做的那些
<7-30,Penny>and can you just tell me what Leonard does?

373
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,100
<7-30,Penny>好吧
<7-30,Penny>All right.

374
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,740
<7-31,Sheldon>莱纳德正致力于研究出为何亚原子粒子
<7-31,Sheldon>Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles

375
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,200
<7-31,Sheldon>会像现在这样运动
<7-31,Sheldon>move the way they do.

376
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,940
<7-32,Penny>真的  就这样
<7-32,Penny>Really? That's it?

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
<7-32,Penny>这听起来并不是很复杂嘛
<7-32,Penny>Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.

378
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,070
<7-32,Penny>是不复杂
<7-32,Penny>It's not.

379
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,240
<7-33,Sheldon>所以莱纳德才干这个
<7-33,Sheldon>That's why Leonard does it.

380
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,840
<7-34,Penny>我只有一个问题
<7-34,Penny>Okay, I just have one question.

381
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,600
<7-34,Penny>亚原子粒子  到底是什么
<7-34,Penny>What exactly are sub-atomic particles?

382
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,540
<7-35,Sheldon>问得好
<7-35,Sheldon>A good question.

383
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,640
<7-36,Penny>谢谢
<7-36,Penny>Thank you.

384
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,440
<7-37,Sheldon>要回答这个问题  我们首先必须自问
<7-37,Sheldon>And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves:

385
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,840
<7-37,Sheldon>物理是什么
<7-37,Sheldon>"What is physics?"

386
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,100
<7-38,Penny>又绕回来了
<7-38,Penny>Oh, balls.

387
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,600
<7-39,Sheldon>在那个古希腊的仲夏夜
<7-39,Sheldon>It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...

388
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,570
<8-1,Howard>我有事要找你算账
<8-1,Howard>Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

389
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,040
<8-2,Leonard>这回我又怎么了
<8-2,Leonard>What did I do now?

390
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,700
<8-3,Howard>我和伯纳黛特正要做爱做的事  被你的短信搅了
<8-3,Howard>I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.

391
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,800
<8-4,Leonard>什么
<8-4,Leonard>What?!

392
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,570
<8-5,Howard>我们都脱光光了  正要水乳交融的时候...
<8-5,Howard>We were completely naked, about to devour each other when,

393
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,140
<8-5,Howard>你发短信告诉她  我对她跟你出来有意见
<8-5,Howard>you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.

394
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,440
<8-6,Leonard>你确实对她跟我出来有意见
<8-6,Leonard>You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.

395
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,400
<8-7,Howard>对  但你不该对她说的
<8-7,Howard>Yeah, but that's not what you tell her.

396
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,000
<8-8,Leonard>那我该跟她怎么说
<8-8,Leonard>What was I supposed to tell her?

397
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,100
<8-9,Howard>我不知道  说些别让我显得
<8-9,Howard>I don't know. Something that doesn't make me come off

398
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,570
<8-9,Howard>猥琐又吃醋的脑残的话
<8-9,Howard>as a petty, jealous douche.

399
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,800
<8-10,Leonard>那该怎么说才好
<8-10,Leonard>And what would that be?

400
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,970
<8-11,Howard>拜托  我得帮你想好一切吗
<8-11,Howard>Come on, do I have to think of everything?

401
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
<8-11,Howard>你好  莱纳德
<8-11,Howard>Hey, Leonard.

402
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,900
<8-12,Bernadette>我来太晚了吗  还能看实验不
<8-12,Bernadette>Am I too late to see the experiment?

403
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,640
<8-14,Bernadette>你来这干嘛
<8-14,Bernadette>What are you doing here?

404
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,600
<8-15,Howard>跟你一样
<8-15,Howard>Same thing you're doing here.

405
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,640
<8-15,Howard>来看莱纳德的实验
<8-15,Howard>I came to see Leonard's experiment.

406
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,970
<8-15,Howard>才怪
<8-15,Howard>No, you didn't.

407
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,700
<8-16,Bernadette>你说过莱纳德的实验很蠢
<8-16,Bernadette>You said Leonard's experiment was stupid.

408
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,100
<8-17,Leonard>你跟她说我的实验很蠢
<8-17,Leonard>You told her my experiment was stupid?

409
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,470
<8-18,Howard>我只是复述谢尔顿的话
<8-18,Howard>I was just repeating what Sheldon said.

410
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,340
<8-18,Howard>我们别再转移话题了吧
<8-18,Howard>Let's not get off topic.

411
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,770
<8-18,Howard>伯纳黛特  我得跟你道歉
<8-18,Howard>Bernadette, I need to apologize.

412
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,440
<8-18,Howard>我错了  不该对你跟谁交友指手划脚的
<8-18,Howard>I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.

413
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,800
<8-19,Leonard>我该留你们俩独处吗
<8-19,Leonard>Should I, um, leave you two alone?

414
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,300
<8-20,Bernadette>不用  莱纳德  你也该听听
<8-20,Bernadette>No, Leonard, you should hear this.

415
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,270
<8-21,Leonard>好  反正我也没想走
<8-21,Leonard>Okay, good, 'cause I wasn't really gonna go.

416
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,600
<8-22,Howard>我知道我看上去自信满满  老于世故  但
<8-22,Howard>Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but...

417
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,840
<8-22,Howard>其实我并不是这样的
<8-22,Howard>the truth is I'm not.

418
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,840
<8-23,Leonard>好雷人
<8-23,Leonard>We're shocked.

419
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,040
<8-24,Howard>所以我容易感到受到其他人的威胁
<8-24,Howard>Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.

420
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,340
<8-25,Leonard>或噪音  或围观群众
<8-25,Leonard>Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

421
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,540
<8-26,Howard>但我已经知道  这样做有多蠢
<8-26,Howard>But I now realize how foolish that is.

422
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,970
<8-27,Leonard>他有次就因为头卡在毛衣里
<8-27,Leonard>He had a panic attack once

423
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,200
<8-27,Leonard>就恐慌了
<8-27,Leonard>when he got his head stuck in a sweater.

424
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,470
<8-28,Howard>那可是件高领套头毛衣
<8-28,Howard>It was a full turtleneck.

425
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,570
<8-28,Howard>你为什么不帮帮我
<8-28,Howard>Why aren't you helping me?

426
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,200
<8-28,Howard>我不知道
<8-28,Howard>I don't know.

427
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,200
<8-29,Leonard>也许因为  我疯了
<8-29,Leonard>Maybe because I'm... crazy?!

428
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,500
<8-30,Howard>伯纳黛特  求你再给我一次机会吧
<8-30,Howard>Bernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance.

429
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,170
<8-31,Bernadette>你怎么想  莱纳德
<8-31,Bernadette>What do you think, Leonard?

430
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
<8-31,Bernadette>我该再给他一次机会吗
<8-31,Bernadette>Should I give him another chance?

431
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,400
<8-32,Leonard>你自己做主
<8-32,Leonard>It's up to you.

432
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,240
<8-32,Leonard>反正他也没说你的实验蠢
<8-32,Leonard>He didn't call your experiment stupid.

433
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
<8-33,Bernadette>过来吧  屁屁脸
<8-33,Bernadette>Come here, tushy face.

434
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,170
<8-33,Bernadette>屁屁脸
<8-33,Bernadette>"Tushy face."

435
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,970
<8-34,Leonard>这话一定得立马推上微博
<8-34,Leonard>That is going on Twitter right now.

436
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,900
<9-1,Bernadette>拉杰  你真该去看看莱纳德的实验
<9-1,Bernadette>Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment.

437
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,500
<9-1,Bernadette>电子束发射后产生的干涉图样
<9-1,Bernadette>The interference pattern was so cool

438
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,140
<9-1,Bernadette>实在太酷了
<9-1,Bernadette>when the electron beam was on.

439
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,570
<9-2,Leonard>很高兴你喜欢
<9-2,Leonard>Glad you enjoyed it.

440
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,600
<9-2,Leonard>多数人对我的工作都不那么感兴趣
<9-2,Leonard>Most people aren't that interested in what I do.

441
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,940
<9-3,Penny>莱纳德  其实你这么说不对
<9-3,Penny>Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

442
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,240
<9-3,Penny>事实上  最近我一直在琢磨
<9-3,Penny>In fact, recently I've been thinking that

443
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,500
<9-3,Penny>考虑到你实验中的各项参数
<9-3,Penny>given the parameters of your experiment,

445
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,670
<9-3,Penny>所进行的电子干涉实验
<9-3,Penny>of the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different

446
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,770
<9-3,Penny>跟荷兰已成功进行的实验  没有任何不同
<9-3,Penny>than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands.

451
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,900
<8-22,Howard>就这样  我也就知道这些
<8-22,Howard>That's it. That's all I know.

452
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,340
