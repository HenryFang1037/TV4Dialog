00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,220
<9-19,Raj>《生活大爆炸》前情提要
<9-19,Raj>Previously on The Big Bang Theory

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,450
<9-19,Raj>谢尔顿  你这是想出了一个办法
<9-19,Raj>Sheldon, did you just figure out a method

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,350
<1-1,Ira Flatow>可以人工合成一种新型稳定超重元素吗
<1-1,Ira Flatow>for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,910
<9-16,Raj>是吗
<9-16,Raj>Did I?

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,540
<4-13,Wil>这不可能呀
<4-13,Wil>Well, that can't be right.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,960
<4-14,Sheldon>从来没有人成功过呢
<4-14,Sheldon>No one's ever done that before.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,810
<4-15,Wil>除了我  我想出来了
<4-15,Wil>Except me, because I just did it!

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,620
<4-17,Amy>谢尔顿谢尔顿脑力无边
<4-17,Amy>Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,650
<4-17,Amy>谢尔顿谢尔顿脑震八方
<4-17,Amy>Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,070
<6-4,Leonard>我犯了个可怕的错误
<6-4,Leonard>I've made a horrible mistake.

11
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,410
<6-5,Sheldon>你在说什么
<6-5,Sheldon>What are you talking about?

12
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,190
<6-6,Leonard>这个表格是平方厘米制的
<6-6,Leonard>This table-- it's in square centimeters.

13
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,970
<6-7,Sheldon>我看成了平方米
<6-7,Sheldon>I read it as square meters.

14
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,440
<6-8,Leonard>知道这意味着什么吗
<6-8,Leonard>You know what that means?

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,420
<5-14,Raj>美国人看不懂公制吗
<5-14,Raj>That Americans can't handle the metric system?

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,540
<5-15,Bernadette>艾米  我这是失之毫厘差之千里的错误
<5-15,Bernadette>Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,770
<6-5,Sheldon>但是中国研究小组发现了元素
<6-5,Sheldon>But the Chinese team found the element.

18
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,950
<6-5,Sheldon>他们不应该发现的
<6-5,Sheldon>Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

19
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,730
<6-5,Sheldon>我的计算是错的
<6-5,Sheldon>My calculations were wrong.

20
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,880
<6-5,Sheldon>我这辈子最伟大的科学成就
<6-5,Sheldon>the greatest scientific achievement of my life

21
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,370
<6-5,Sheldon>是建立在一个巨大的错误之上
<6-5,Sheldon>is based on a blunder.

22
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,900
<6-5,Sheldon>我不是天才
<6-5,Sheldon>I'm not a genius,

23
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,770
<6-5,Sheldon>我是个骗子
<6-5,Sheldon>I'm a fraud.

24
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,840
<6-5,Sheldon>谢尔顿  在神经系统学里
<6-5,Sheldon>You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,180
<6-5,Sheldon>我们总是在大脑某处有所发现
<6-5,Sheldon>we're forever finding something in one part of the brain

26
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,560
<6-5,Sheldon>但地方和原来想的完全不一样
<6-5,Sheldon>that we thought was someplace else.

27
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,760
<6-5,Sheldon>这下可好  我连骗子都不如了
<6-5,Sheldon>Oh, great, now I'm worse than a fraud.

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,990
<6-5,Sheldon>我沦为生物学家之流了
<6-5,Sheldon>I'm practically a biologist.

30
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,410
<6-5,Sheldon>欢迎收听《科学星期五》  我是艾拉·菲莱
<6-5,Sheldon>This is Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow.

31
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,120
<6-5,Sheldon>今日的来宾是第一个
<6-5,Sheldon>My guest today is responsible for the discovery

32
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,880
<6-5,Sheldon>稳定超重元素的发现者
<6-5,Sheldon>of the first stable super-heavy element.

33
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,810
<6-5,Sheldon>欢迎谢尔顿·库伯博士
<6-5,Sheldon>Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

34
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,300
<6-5,Sheldon>谢谢
<6-5,Sheldon>Thank you.

35
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,560
<6-5,Sheldon>是学校硬要我来的
<6-5,Sheldon>Uh, the university made me come here.

36
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,990
<6-5,Sheldon>我本人并不想来
<6-5,Sheldon>I didn't want to.

37
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,840
<1-1,Ira Flatow>我是这节目的忠实听众哦
<1-1,Ira Flatow>Uh, big fan of the show.

38
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,950
<1-2,Sheldon>我听说你之所以发现这元素
<1-2,Sheldon>So, I understand that you actually discovered

39
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,160
<1-3,Ira>完全是因为一个错误
<1-3,Ira>this element by mistake.

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,770
<1-4,Sheldon>是的
<1-4,Sheldon>Yes.

41
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,690
<1-5,Ira>而科学界有些人把这个错误称之为
<1-5,Ira>And some people in the science community are calling it

42
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,940
<1-6,Sheldon>-"蠢货奇迹"  -那些人是谁
<1-6,Sheldon>- "The Wonder Blunder." - Who?

43
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,190
<1-6,Sheldon>告诉我他们的名字
<1-6,Sheldon>Give me their names.

44
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,220
<1-6,Sheldon>肯定是沃罗威茨
<1-6,Sheldon>I bet it's Wolowitz.

45
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,800
<1-7,Ira>这故事真是太了不起了
<1-7,Ira>It's just such a fascinating story.

46
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,640
<1-7,Ira>你在计算上偏差了这么多
<1-7,Ira>Your calculations are way off,

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,480
<1-8,Sheldon>却还是有人找到了这元素
<1-8,Sheldon>but they find the element anyway.

48
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,010
<1-8,Sheldon>感觉就像是读错藏宝地图
<1-8,Sheldon>It's like misreading a treasure map

49
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,570
<1-8,Sheldon>却还是找到了宝藏一样
<1-8,Sheldon>and still finding the treasure.

50
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,250
<1-8,Sheldon>我们能聊别的话题吗
<1-8,Sheldon>Can we talk about something else?

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,970
<1-9,Ira>你知道我会唱山歌吗
<1-9,Ira>Do you know that I yodel?

52
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,690
<1-9,Ira>那不错啊  但这发现有可能
<1-9,Ira>That's interesting, but this could be taking you

53
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,340
<1-9,Ira>让你获得诺贝尔奖
<1-9,Ira>down the path toward a Nobel Prize.

54
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,430
<1-9,Ira>而且是化学奖哦
<1-9,Ira>And in chemistry, no less.

55
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,730
<1-9,Ira>这种情况很少见吧
<1-9,Ira>And wouldn't that be unusual?

56
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,830
<1-9,Ira>因为你是物理学家
<1-9,Ira>Because you're a physicist.

57
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,550
<1-10,Sheldon>对对对  我将是获得诺贝尔化学奖的物理学家
<1-10,Sheldon>Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry.

58
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,710
<1-10,Sheldon>大家快来笑我这个奇葩吧
<1-10,Sheldon>Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

59
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,420
<1-10,Sheldon>我不需要坐在这忍受你的羞辱  菲莱
<1-10,Sheldon>You know, I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow.

60
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,860
<1-10,Sheldon>就是因为有你这种恶霸
<1-10,Sheldon>It is because of bullies like you,

61
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,360
<1-10,Sheldon>所以每天才会有越来越多的
<1-10,Sheldon>every day more and more Americans

62
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,710
<1-10,Sheldon>美国人转投看电视
<1-10,Sheldon>are making the switch to television.

64
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,390
<1-10,Sheldon>本字幕由人人影视字幕组翻译
<1-10,Sheldon>禁止用作任何商业盈利行为

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,710
<1-10,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-10,Sheldon>第七季  第十集

69
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,010
<2-1,Sheldon>塞伯特校长  你为什么要凶我
<2-1,Sheldon>President Seibert, I don't know why you're yelling.

70
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,330
<2-1,Sheldon>是你叫我去上广播节目的
<2-1,Sheldon>You're the one who made me go on the radio.

71
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,360
<2-1,Sheldon>我以为那会是一场专业的科学访谈
<2-1,Sheldon>I was expecting a professional science interview,

72
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,750
<2-1,Sheldon>而不是被整人节目口无遮拦的主持人攻击
<2-1,Sheldon>not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock.

73
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,400
<2-1,Sheldon>如果学校这么缺钱
<2-1,Sheldon>Well, if the university needs money so badly,

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,890
<2-1,Sheldon>或许你该设立个脏话罚款筒赚钱
<2-1,Sheldon>perhaps you should start a swear jar.

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,590
<2-1,Sheldon>你这一串脏话够罚一块钱啊
<2-1,Sheldon>That one's worth a dollar.

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,010
<2-2,Amy>我知道你不喜欢上节目
<2-2,Amy>I know you don't like it,

77
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,530
<2-2,Amy>但是你每次去接受采访
<2-2,Amy>but every time you do an interview,

78
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,570
<2-2,Amy>都能提大学提高知名度
<2-2,Amy>it raises the profile of the university.

79
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,160
<2-2,Amy>高知名度就有高资助费
<2-2,Amy>That translates to funding.

80
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,090
<2-3,Sheldon>我又不是受训的卖艺猴子
<2-3,Sheldon>Yeah, well, I'm not just some trained monkey

81
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,910
<2-3,Sheldon>帮他们乞讨钱
<2-3,Sheldon>dancing for coins.

82
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,070
<2-4,Leonard>你当然不是啦
<2-4,Leonard>Of course you're not.

83
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,890
<2-4,Leonard>那种猴子多讨人喜欢
<2-4,Leonard>People love trained monkeys.

84
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,320
<2-5,Penny>你有什么好不开心的啊
<2-5,Penny>How can you not be happy?

85
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,320
<2-5,Penny>你又高又瘦又出名
<2-5,Penny>You're tall, thin and famous.

86
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,980
<2-5,Penny>天啊  我好嫉妒谢尔顿
<2-5,Penny>Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.

87
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,200
<2-6,Sheldon>这些访谈估计还持续一段时间
<2-6,Sheldon>Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while.

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,640
<2-6,Sheldon>你得找到习惯这些事的方法
<2-6,Sheldon>You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.

89
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,530
<2-7,Sheldon>但你们没人能懂我的心情
<2-7,Sheldon>But none of you know what this is like.

90
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,560
<2-7,Sheldon>自己悔恨不已的事却被人大肆赞扬
<2-7,Sheldon>Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
<2-8,Penny>想必你没跟我一起去过狂欢节
<2-8,Penny>Mmm... you clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.

92
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,600
<3-1,Bernadette>要暂停一下游戏来帮忙我打扫吗
<3-1,Bernadette>Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?

93
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,550
<3-2,Howard>我正在打扫啊
<3-2,Howard>I am cleaning up.

94
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,070
<3-2,Howard>打扫小丑对高谭市造成的破坏
<3-2,Howard>Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.

95
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,060
<3-3,Bernadette>拜托  要来暂住的可是你的朋友
<3-3,Bernadette>Come on, it's your friend who's coming to stay here.

96
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,350
<3-4,Howard>拉杰是在印度长大的
<3-4,Howard>Raj grew up in India.

97
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,380
<3-4,Howard>相信我  比这更脏的他都见过
<3-4,Howard>Trust me, he's seen worse.

98
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,500
<3-5,Bernadette>华仔
<3-5,Bernadette>Howie.

99
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,120
<3-6,Howard>我保证这周接下来的日子我会帮忙
<3-6,Howard>I promise I'll help out the rest of the week.

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,010
<3-6,Howard>这周接下来的日子
<3-6,Howard>The rest of the week?

101
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,630
<3-7,Bernadette>你不是说就一两天吗
<3-7,Bernadette>You said it was just gonna be a night or two.

102
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,740
<3-8,Howard>但如果我直接跟你说住一周
<3-8,Howard>Yeah, but if I told you a week,

103
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,260
<3-8,Howard>-你会同意吗  -当然不会
<3-8,Howard>- would you have said yes? - No!

104
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,450
<3-10,Howard>所以我只好出此下策啦
<3-10,Howard>Then you left me no choice.

105
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,180
<3-11,Bernadette>我喜欢拉杰  但他这暂住也太久了吧
<3-11,Bernadette>I love Raj, but that's a long time for a house guest.

106
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,770
<3-12,Howard>但他的公寓整个楼都在除虫  没法住
<3-12,Howard>I know, but they're tenting his building.

107
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,420
<3-12,Howard>他也找不到能让带宠物的酒店
<3-12,Howard>He can't find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.

108
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,750
<3-13,Bernadette>他还带小桂子来啊
<3-13,Bernadette>He's bringing Cinnamon?

109
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,770
<3-14,Howard>待一整周呢
<3-14,Howard>For a whole week!

110
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,540
<3-14,Howard>有些人真是大惊小怪
<3-14,Howard>The nerve of some people.

111
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,730
<4-1,Sheldon>迎面而来的是羞愧号快车
<4-1,Sheldon>Here comes the Embarrassment Express.

112
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,900
<4-1,Sheldon>将会经过  骗子镇站
<4-1,Sheldon>With stops at Fraudville...

113
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,420
<4-1,Sheldon>蠢货奇迹山站
<4-1,Sheldon>WonderBlunderberg...

114
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,240
<4-1,Sheldon>以及堪萨斯城
<4-1,Sheldon>and Kansas City.

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,550
<4-1,Sheldon>只因这是运输交汇处
<4-1,Sheldon>Because it's a hub.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,400
<4-2,Amy>谢尔顿  我能进来吧
<4-2,Amy>Sheldon, can I come in?

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,910
<4-3,Sheldon>-你有带饼干吗  -没有
<4-3,Sheldon>- Do you have cookies? - No.

118
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,050
<4-5,Sheldon>很好  我不配吃饼干  进来吧
<4-5,Sheldon>Good. I don't deserve cookies. Come in.

119
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,280
<4-6,Wil Wheaton>-威尔...  -谢尔顿
<4-6,Wil Wheaton>- Wil...? - Hey, Sheldon.

120
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,510
<4-6,Wil Wheaton>好久不见
<4-6,Wil Wheaton>It's been a while.

121
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,790
<4-7,Sheldon>你怎么来了
<4-7,Sheldon>Why are you here?

122
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,270
<4-8,Wil>艾米说你最近不开心
<4-8,Wil>Amy said you were having a rough time,

123
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,430
<4-8,Wil>我就想来开导开导你
<4-8,Wil>and I thought maybe we could talk.

124
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,670
<4-8,Wil>可以吗
<4-8,Wil>Is that okay?

125
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,140
<4-9,Sheldon>当然可以
<4-9,Sheldon>Certainly.

126
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,940
<4-9,Sheldon>虽然...
<4-9,Sheldon>Although...

127
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,330
<4-9,Sheldon>现在我就不开心
<4-9,Sheldon>right now, I'm having a rough time

128
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,040
<4-9,Sheldon>因为我房间现在有三个人
<4-9,Sheldon>because there's three people in my room,

129
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,960
<4-9,Sheldon>感觉跟迪斯科舞厅一样拥挤
<4-9,Sheldon>and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.

130
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,620
<4-10,Amy>谢尔顿  你说你不开心是因为
<4-10,Amy>Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention

131
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,890
<4-10,Amy>人们都在关注让你悔恨不已的事
<4-10,Amy>for something you wished you never did.

132
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,820
<4-11,Wil>关于这事  我也有点经验
<4-11,Wil>Yeah, I know a little something about that.

133
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,000
<4-12,Sheldon>少来了  威尔
<4-12,Sheldon>Oh, nonsense, Wil.

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,900
<4-12,Sheldon>你的刷屏微博也没那么糟啦
<4-12,Sheldon>Your endless tweets are not that bad.

135
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,340
<4-13,Wil>我想起这么久不见他的原因了
<4-13,Wil>I remember why it's been a while.

136
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,470
<4-13,Wil>谢尔顿  我要说的是
<4-13,Wil>Sheldon, I was actually talking

137
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,600
<4-13,Wil>我小时候在星际迷航里演出的事
<4-13,Wil>about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

138
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,510
<4-14,Sheldon>你怎么会不喜欢因为出演该电影
<4-14,Sheldon>How could you not like getting attention

139
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,050
<4-14,Sheldon>而获得大家的关注呢
<4-14,Sheldon>for playing Wesley Crusher?

140
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,470
<4-14,Sheldon>你的角色很讨喜啊
<4-14,Sheldon>You were wonderful.

141
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,410
<4-14,Sheldon>一个全知全能记忆超强的男孩
<4-14,Sheldon>A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory.

142
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,780
<4-14,Sheldon>谁对那个角色会没有代入感啊
<4-14,Sheldon>Who couldn't relate to that?

143
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,310
<4-15,Wil>不是每个人都这么想的
<4-15,Wil>Well, not everybody felt that way.

144
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,070
<4-15,Wil>很多人很讨厌那个角色
<4-15,Wil>A lot of people really hated the character,

145
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,310
<4-15,Wil>因此有些人也为此而讨厌我
<4-15,Wil>and some of them hated me because of it.

146
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,390
<4-15,Wil>我也曾接受过访谈
<4-15,Wil>I would do interviews,

147
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,330
<4-15,Wil>很多人都会嘲讽我
<4-15,Wil>and people would be mean to me.

148
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,370
<4-16,Sheldon>我也碰到这种事了
<4-16,Sheldon>That just happened to me.

149
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,970
<4-16,Sheldon>下次你想不出刷什么屏了
<4-16,Sheldon>Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

150
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,080
<4-16,Sheldon>欢迎你写一条艾拉·菲莱是混蛋的微博
<4-16,Sheldon>feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

151
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,640
<4-17,Amy>谢尔顿  重点的是威尔能学会接受现实
<4-17,Amy>Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life

152
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,270
<4-17,Amy>然后更重要的东西迈进
<4-17,Amy>and moved on to bigger and better things.

153
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,420
<4-18,Wil>是啊  我现在是个作家
<4-18,Wil>Yeah, I'm an author now,

<4-18,Wil>我自己还出了一部关于桌游的网络剧
<4-18,Wil>and I have my own web series about board games.

156
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,750
<4-19,Amy>我们是要哄他开心  所以...
<4-19,Amy>We're trying to cheer him up, so...

157
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,600
<4-20,Wil>我只是想告诉你  曾有一段时间
<4-20,Wil>I'm just saying that there was a time when I thought

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,920
<4-20,Wil>我以为自己走不出那角色的阴影
<4-20,Wil>I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

159
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,750
<4-20,Wil>但现在
<4-20,Wil>But now,

160
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,510
<4-20,Wil>那只是我完美人生中的一小章节
<4-20,Wil>it's just one small part of a pretty great life,

161
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,050
<4-20,Wil>我也很开心有过那些经历
<4-20,Wil>and it's a part that I'm happy is there.

162
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,220
<4-21,Sheldon>我明白你的意思
<4-21,Sheldon>I do see what you're saying.

<4-23,Sheldon>你们俩个要留下来一起玩火车吗
<4-23,Sheldon>Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?

244
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,920
<6-15,Sheldon>我现在只有九个朋友了
<6-15,Sheldon>I'm back down to nine friends!

245
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,190
<6-15,Sheldon>算了  八个吧  我也不喜欢沃罗威茨
<6-15,Sheldon>Make it eight-- I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

246
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,860
<6-16,Leonard>我不明白了
<6-16,Leonard>I-I don't understand.

247
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,530
<6-16,Leonard>自从你发现这个该死的元素后
<6-16,Leonard>All you've done since you discovered

248
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,950
<6-16,Leonard>你就一直在抱怨个不停
<6-16,Leonard>this stupid element was complain.

249
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,400
<6-16,Leonard>我只是想让你开心
<6-16,Leonard>I was trying to make you happy!

250
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,050
<6-17,Sheldon>所以要夺走我唯一成名的机会吗
<6-17,Sheldon>By taking away my only claim to fame?

251
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,650
<6-17,Sheldon>如果你想让我开心
<6-17,Sheldon>Well, if you wanted to make me happy,

252
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,950
<6-17,Sheldon>你可以跟我讲个笑话
<6-17,Sheldon>you could have told me a joke.

253
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,110
<6-17,Sheldon>或是给我看一段有爱的视频
<6-17,Sheldon>Or shown me a cute video

254
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,430
<6-17,Sheldon>比如考拉和水獭
<6-17,Sheldon>of a koala and an otter

255
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,430
<6-17,Sheldon>破天荒地成为朋友
<6-17,Sheldon>becoming unlikely friends.

256
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,370
<6-18,Leonard>你总是最有理那个
<6-18,Leonard>Oh, there is no winning with you.

257
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,620
<6-18,Leonard>而且考拉和水獭居住地差了十万八千里
<6-18,Leonard>And koalas and otters don't even live near each other!

258
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,890
<6-19,Sheldon>所以它们成为朋友才是破天荒之举
<6-19,Sheldon>That's what makes their friendship unlikely!

259
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,620
<6-20,Penny>你们俩在吵什么啊
<6-20,Penny>What's with all the yelling?

260
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,630
<6-21,Sheldon>莱纳德推翻了我的发现
<6-21,Sheldon>Leonard disproved my element.

261
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,840
<6-21,Sheldon>现在所有的关注都要消失了
<6-21,Sheldon>Now all the attention is going to go away.

262
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,440
<6-22,Penny>这很好啊  你一定很激动吧
<6-22,Penny>Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled!

263
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,590
<6-23,Sheldon>很好  我现在只剩七个朋友了
<6-23,Sheldon>That's it! I'm down to seven friends.

264
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,890
<6-24,Penny>他是连霍比特人和超级英雄都算上了吧
<6-24,Penny>He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?

265
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,750
<6-25,Sheldon>一开始我以为元素是真实存在的  我不想要它
<6-25,Sheldon>When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it.

266
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,770
<6-25,Sheldon>但现在莱纳德证实它并不存在
<6-25,Sheldon>But now that Leonard made it not exist,

267
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,890
<6-25,Sheldon>它反而成了我全世界最想要的东西了
<6-25,Sheldon>I want it more than anything in the world.

268
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,710
<6-26,Leonard>那元素从来就不存在
<6-26,Leonard>The-the element never existed.

269
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,650
<6-26,Leonard>不是我夺走它  而是科学夺走了它
<6-26,Leonard>I didn't take it away, science took it away.

270
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,810
<6-26,Leonard>要气就气科学吧
<6-26,Leonard>Be mad at science.

271
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,820
<6-27,Sheldon>你胆敢用科学来反驳我
<6-27,Sheldon>Don't you dare use science against me.

272
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,080
<6-27,Sheldon>科学可是我最好的朋友
<6-27,Sheldon>Science is my best friend!

273
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,970
<6-27,Sheldon>太好了  我又有八个朋友了
<6-27,Sheldon>Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

274
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,210
<6-28,Leonard>你能告诉他  他疯了吗
<6-28,Leonard>Will you tell him he's out of his mind.

275
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,520
<6-29,Penny>老实说  我理解他的意思
<6-29,Penny>Actually, I get what he's saying.

276
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,800
<6-30,Sheldon>太棒了  变九个了
<6-30,Sheldon>Oh, yes! Nine!

277
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
<6-30,Sheldon>欢迎回来  朋友
<6-30,Sheldon>Welcome back, buddy.

278
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,520
<6-31,Penny>就像跟一个你不是很喜欢的人约会
<6-31,Penny>It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into,

279
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,490
<6-31,Penny>等那人跟你分手了
<6-31,Penny>and then they break up with you

280
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,800
<6-31,Penny>你就变得很想要那人了
<6-31,Penny>and then you want them more than ever.

281
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,740
<6-32,Sheldon>我完全不知道她在说什么
<6-32,Sheldon>I have no idea what she's talking about.

282
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,320
<6-32,Sheldon>但我们现在联手对付你  所以我赞成她的话
<6-32,Sheldon>but we're ganged up on you so I agree.

283
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,990
<6-33,Leonard>谢尔顿  那你要我怎么样
<6-33,Leonard>Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do,

284
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,430
<6-33,Leonard>隐瞒我的发现吗
<6-33,Leonard>hide the information?

285
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,300
<6-33,Leonard>如果我不公布
<6-33,Leonard>If I don't publish it,

286
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,340
<6-33,Leonard>迟早其他人也会这么做的
<6-33,Leonard>it's just a matter of time before someone else does.

287
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,110
<6-34,Sheldon>不  你当然得公布
<6-34,Sheldon>No, no, of course you have to publish.

288
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,970
<6-34,Sheldon>那是你作为一个科学家应尽的责任
<6-34,Sheldon>That's your responsibility as a scientist.

289
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,770
<6-34,Sheldon>否则会违背职业道德
<6-34,Sheldon>Doing otherwise would be unethical.

290
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,760
<6-34,Sheldon>你别无选择
<6-34,Sheldon>You have no choice.

291
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,780
<6-35,Leonard>好吧  我会公布
<6-35,Leonard>Fine, I'll publish.

292
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,580
<6-36,Sheldon>你看这没良心的混球
<6-36,Sheldon>Can you believe this guy?

293
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,270
<7-1,Bernadette>拉杰把碗都洗了
<7-1,Bernadette>Aw! Raj did the dishes.

294
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,640
<7-2,Howard>你怎么知道不是我洗的
<7-2,Howard>How do you know I didn't do them?

295
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,250
<7-3,Bernadette>因为有一次  所有刀子都没洗
<7-3,Bernadette>Because once, when all the knives were dirty,

296
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,660
<7-3,Bernadette>你宁愿用钥匙切面包圈  也懒得洗
<7-3,Bernadette>you cut a bagel with your keys.

297
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,530
<7-4,Raj>早上好  两位
<7-4,Raj>Good morning, everybody.

298
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,660
<7-4,Raj>我出去的时候  顺便买了咖啡
<7-4,Raj>I picked up coffee while I was out.

299
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,700
<7-4,Raj>伯纳黛特  这是你的大豆薄荷摩卡
<7-4,Raj>Bernadette, here's your soy peppermint mocha.

300
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,040
<7-5,Bernadette>你真是太客气了
<7-5,Bernadette>Aw, you didn't have to do that.

301
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,790
<7-6,Raj>乐意之至
<7-6,Raj>Oh, my pleasure,

302
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,840
<7-6,Raj>对了  不要担心今天的演讲
<7-6,Raj>and don't worry about your presentation today.

303
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,890
<7-6,Raj>你一定会表现出色
<7-6,Raj>You're gonna be great.

304
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,960
<7-7,Howard>对啊  你一定能震惊四座
<7-7,Howard>Yeah, you're gonna knock it out of the park.

305
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,330
<7-8,Bernadette>我今天要做什么演讲来着
<7-8,Bernadette>What presentation do I have today?

306
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,390
<7-9,Howard>快走吧
<7-9,Howard>Just go.

307
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,920
<7-10,Raj>他很爱你的
<7-10,Raj>He loves you.

308
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,630
<7-11,Howard>你这是干什么
<7-11,Howard>What are you doing?

309
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,180
<7-11,Howard>你是故意让我难堪吗
<7-11,Howard>Are you trying to make me look bad?

310
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,320
<7-12,Raj>我只是想当个好客人
<7-12,Raj>I'm just being a good house guest.

311
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,120
<7-13,Howard>不  你是想当一个比我还好的丈夫
<7-13,Howard>No, you're being a better husband than I am.

312
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,820
<7-13,Howard>洗碗  买咖啡
<7-13,Howard>Doing the dishes, getting coffee,

313
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,320
<7-13,Howard>对她的生活了如指掌
<7-13,Howard>knowing about her life--

314
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,660
<7-13,Howard>谁会那样做啊
<7-13,Howard>who does that?

315
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,580
<7-14,Raj>别这样嘛  我也给你买了一杯
<7-14,Raj>Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.

316
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,410
<7-15,Howard>我不想喝咖啡
<7-15,Howard>I don't want coffee.

317
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,710
<7-16,Raj>所以我给你买了热巧克力
<7-16,Raj>That's why I got you hot chocolate.

318
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,190
<7-17,Howard>快给我
<7-17,Howard>Give me that.

319
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,520
<7-17,Howard>不许什么都做得比我好
<7-17,Howard>Just stop showing me up.

320
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,090
<7-18,Raj>霍华德  听我说
<7-18,Raj>Howard, listen to me.

321
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,720
<7-18,Raj>你是一个很棒的丈夫
<7-18,Raj>You're a great husband.

322
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,310
<7-18,Raj>没错  你倾听的技巧还需要多练练
<7-18,Raj>Yes, your listening skills could use some work.

323
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,590
<7-18,Raj>但作为一个独生子
<7-18,Raj>But it's amazing how far you've come

324
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,350
<7-18,Raj>还有一个过度保护的老妈
<7-18,Raj>given that you're an only child

325
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,470
<7-18,Raj>你算做得很不错啦
<7-18,Raj>raised by an over-protective mom.

326
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,160
<7-19,Howard>这情形好像有点奇怪啊
<7-19,Howard>Um, is this getting weird?

327
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,700
<7-20,Raj>别动
<7-20,Raj>Hang on.

328
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
<7-21,Howard>的确是很怪
<7-21,Howard>So, yes.

329
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,750
<8-1,Leonard>我想告诉你一声  我发表了我的发现
<8-1,Leonard>I just wanted to let you know that I-I posted my findings.

330
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,290
<8-2,Sheldon>我看见了
<8-2,Sheldon>I saw.

331
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,280
<8-2,Sheldon>我刚发公告  要求撤回我的论文
<8-2,Sheldon>And I just posted a retraction of my paper.

332
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,310
<8-2,Sheldon>现在整个科学界都知道我是错的
<8-2,Sheldon>Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.

333
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,500
<8-3,Leonard>这样的事情经常发生  谢尔顿
<8-3,Leonard>These things happen all the time, Sheldon.

334
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,080
<8-3,Leonard>不是发生在我身上
<8-3,Leonard>Not to me.

335
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,990
<8-4,Sheldon>我之前唯一一次公告的撤回说明
<8-4,Sheldon>The only other retraction I ever had to issue

336
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,810
<8-4,Sheldon>还是在我7岁的时候  我承认我哥哥
<8-4,Sheldon>was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother

337
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,720
<8-4,Sheldon>是东德州最优秀的忍者
<8-4,Sheldon>was the greatest ninja in East Texas.

338
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,680
<8-4,Sheldon>但那只是把我的脸
<8-4,Sheldon>But that was just a ploy

339
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,730
<8-4,Sheldon>从他的臭腋窝里拯救出来的权宜之计
<8-4,Sheldon>to get my face out of his armpit.

340
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,500
<8-5,Barry>他在这里啊
<8-5,Barry>There he is!

341
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,600
<8-5,Barry>我最爱的超级英雄
<8-5,Barry>It's my favorite superhero--

342
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
<8-6,Leonard>撤回侠
<8-6,Leonard>the Retractor!

343
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,750
<8-6,Leonard>拜托  别落井下石了
<8-6,Leonard>Come on, don't give him a hard time.

344
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,380
<8-6,Leonard>对不起  库珀
<8-6,Leonard>I'm sorry, Cooper.

345
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
<8-7,Barry>我撤回刚才说的话
<8-7,Barry>I retract it.

346
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,280
<8-7,Barry>顺便说下  霍夫斯塔德
<8-7,Barry>By the way, Hofstadter,

347
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,820
<8-7,Barry>做得真棒  推翻了中国研究组的结果
<8-7,Barry>nice job disproving the Chinese team.

348
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,760
<8-8,Leonard>不算什么
<8-8,Leonard>It's not a big deal.

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,950
<8-9,Barry>这可是大事
<8-9,Barry>It's a huge deal.

350
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,690
<8-9,Barry>库珀  也许你不太适合研究物理
<8-9,Barry>Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing.

351
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,160
<8-9,Barry>有没有考虑转去做零售
<8-9,Barry>Have you ever considered a career in retail?

352
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,010
<8-9,Barry>这样你就能靠撤回东西过生活了
<8-9,Barry>That way you could take things back for a living.

353
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,820
<8-10,Leonard>好了  巴里  太过了
<8-10,Leonard>Okay, Barry, that's enough.

354
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,380
<8-10,Leonard>不  没事
<8-10,Leonard>Oh, no, that's okay.

355
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,580
<8-11,Sheldon>我可以打赢自己的战斗
<8-11,Sheldon>I can fight my own battles.

356
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,820
<8-11,Sheldon>对吗  "八尼"
<8-11,Sheldon>Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

357
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,110
<8-11,Sheldon>你这是
<8-11,Sheldon>Is...?

358
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,190
<8-12,Barry>在嘲笑我的语言障碍吗
<8-12,Barry>Is that a reference to my speech impediment?

359
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,290
<8-12,Barry>太伤人了
<8-12,Barry>That's pretty hurtful.

360
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,100
<8-12,Barry>我
<8-12,Barry>I...

361
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,880
<8-12,Barry>我自己没法控制
<8-12,Barry>I can't control it.

362
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,600
<8-13,Sheldon>你说得对
<8-13,Sheldon>You're right,

363
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,910
<8-13,Sheldon>这招太卑鄙了
<8-13,Sheldon>That was uncalled for.

364
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,180
<8-13,Sheldon>我收回
<8-13,Sheldon>I take it back.

365
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,950
<8-14,Barry>你当然要收回了
<8-14,Barry>Of course you do.

366
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,340
<8-14,Barry>因为你是鼎鼎大名的撤回侠
<8-14,Barry>Because you're the Retractor!

367
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,530
<9-1,Bernadette>拉杰  晚餐的味道太好了
<9-1,Bernadette>Raj, this dinner was amazing.

368
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,520
<9-1,Bernadette>如果你多住一段时间
<9-1,Bernadette>If you're here much longer,

369
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,990
<9-1,Bernadette>我得买大一号的衣服了
<9-1,Bernadette>I'm gonna have to buy bigger clothes.

370
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,210
<9-1,Bernadette>瞎说
<9-1,Bernadette>Nonsense.

371
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,370
<9-2,Raj>你需要长点肉
<9-2,Raj>You need a little fattening up.

372
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,910
<9-2,Raj>你最近太瘦了
<9-2,Raj>You've been looking too skinny lately.

373
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,560
<9-3,Bernadette>华仔  你怎么从来不会说这些哄人开心的话
<9-3,Bernadette>Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?

374
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
<9-4,Howard>说什么呢
<9-4,Howard>What are you talking about?

375
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,720
<9-4,Howard>记得上周  我问你
<9-4,Howard>Remember last week, when I asked you

376
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,350
<9-4,Howard>你是否穿了塑身衣  你却没穿吗
<9-4,Howard>if you were wearing Spanx and you weren't?

377
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,900
<9-4,Howard>这明明就是夸你苗条嘛
<9-4,Howard>How's that different?

378
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,530
<9-5,Bernadette>也许你可以学学你的朋友拉杰
<9-5,Bernadette>Maybe you could try being more thoughtful,

379
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,000
<9-5,Bernadette>更体贴一些
<9-5,Bernadette>like your friend Raj.

380
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,810
<9-6,Howard>也许你可以学学拉杰
<9-6,Howard>Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.

381
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,320
<9-7,Bernadette>-是吗  -当然
<9-7,Bernadette>- Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah.

382
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,870
<9-8,Howard>他今天早上为我打包了午餐
<9-8,Howard>He packed me a lunch this morning.

383
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,620
<9-8,Howard>袋子里有张字条写着  "勇敢上吧"
<9-8,Howard>And there was a note inside that said, "Go get 'em"

384
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,000
<9-9,Bernadette>我为这个家做得还不够多吗
<9-9,Bernadette>Like I don't do enough around here.

385
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,280
<9-9,Bernadette>现在还要为你打包午餐吗
<9-9,Bernadette>Now I need to pack your lunch?

386
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,000
<9-9,Bernadette>而且  你为什么需要字条来告诉你
<9-9,Bernadette>And by the way, why do you need a note telling you

387
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,430
<9-9,Bernadette>"勇敢上吧"  你是个大老爷们
<9-9,Bernadette>to "Go get 'em"? You're a grown man!

388
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,950
<9-9,Bernadette>你应该知道要"勇敢上吧"
<9-9,Bernadette>You should know to "Go get 'em"!

389
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,010
<9-10,Howard>我的确知道"勇敢上吧"
<9-10,Howard>I do know to "Go get 'em"

390
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,810
<9-10,Howard>只是有时候  我"勇敢"去"上"的同时
<9-10,Howard>but sometimes it's nice to have emotional support

391
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,560
<9-10,Howard>有精神支持感觉会更好
<9-10,Howard>when I'm going and getting them!

392
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,480
<9-11,Raj>别这样  瞧你们在说些什么话
<9-11,Raj>Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

393
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,280
<9-11,Raj>咱们冷静下  都各退一步
<9-11,Raj>Let's just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.

394
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,110
<9-12,Bernadette>太傻了  我们为什么要吵架
<9-12,Bernadette>This is stupid. Why are we fighting?

395
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,030
<9-12,Bernadette>我不知道
<9-12,Bernadette>I don't know.

396
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,350
<9-13,Howard>我想是因为我觉得自己是个差劲的老公
<9-13,Howard>I guess I was just feeling like I'm a lousy husband.

397
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,660
<9-14,Bernadette>你不是差劲的老公
<9-14,Bernadette>You're not a lousy husband.

398
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,340
<9-14,Bernadette>你是个非常棒的老公
<9-14,Bernadette>You're a great husband.

399
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,670
<9-14,Bernadette>我才觉得自己是个差劲的老婆
<9-14,Bernadette>I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.

400
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,700
<9-15,Howard>开什么玩笑  你最棒了
<9-15,Howard>Are you kidding? You're the best.

401
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,130
<9-15,Howard>我知道问题在哪里
<9-15,Howard>I know what the problem is.

402
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,630
<9-15,Howard>都怪他
<9-15,Howard>It's him!

403
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,670
<9-16,Raj>我做了什么
<9-16,Raj>Oh, what did I do?

404
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,550
<9-17,Howard>你让我们觉得  我们经营婚姻不够用心
<9-17,Howard>You made us feel like we're not trying hard enough.

405
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,970
<9-18,Bernadette>我们之前很满意我们打混摸鱼的婚姻
<9-18,Bernadette>Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage

406
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,630
<9-18,Bernadette>直到你这个祸害出现
<9-18,Bernadette>till you showed up.

407
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,470
<9-19,Raj>我很抱歉让你们生气了
<9-19,Raj>Look, I'm sorry you're upset with me,

408
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,100
<9-19,Raj>但我得说  看到你们统一战线
<9-19,Raj>but I just have to say it's nice to see

409
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,860
<9-19,Raj>真是太好了
<9-19,Raj>the two of you on the same page.

410
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,740
<9-20,Howard>你能支持我一次
<9-20,Howard>Oh, it does feel good to have you

411
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,150
<9-20,Howard>的确感觉不错
<9-20,Howard>backing me up for once.

412
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,000
<9-21,Bernadette>-我总是支持你好吧  -那不是...
<9-21,Bernadette>－ I back you up all the time! - That is not...

413
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
<9-23,Bernadette>-他又在挖坑  -你这人太坏了
<9-23,Bernadette>- He's doing it again! - What is wrong with you?!

414
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,260
<10-1,Leonard>真不敢相信他们把你赶出来了
<10-1,Leonard>I can't believe they kicked you out.

415
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,160
<10-2,Raj>真不敢相信他们还没离婚
<10-2,Raj>I can't believe they're still married.

416
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,360
<10-2,Raj>不好  我把小桂子的牙刷忘在霍华德家了
<10-2,Raj>Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's toothbrush at Howard's.

417
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,420
<10-2,Raj>看来你又要和爸比共用一把牙刷啦
<10-2,Raj>I guess you're sharing with Daddy again.

418
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,870
<10-3,Penny>要我打电话给反虐待动物协会就吠一声
<10-3,Penny>Bark once if you need me to call PETA.

419
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,800
<10-4,Sheldon>那只动物在咱们家干嘛
<10-4,Sheldon>What's that animal doing in our apartment?

420
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,980
<10-5,Leonard>放轻松  她在笼子里  出不来的
<10-5,Leonard>Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.

421
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,930
<10-6,Sheldon>送你几个字送给你
<10-6,Sheldon>I have two words for you:

422
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,540
<10-6,Sheldon>侏罗纪公园[恐龙逃出]
<10-6,Sheldon>Jurassic Park.

423
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,140
<10-6,Sheldon>今天真是越来越糟糕
<10-6,Sheldon>This day just keeps getting worse and worse.

424
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,700
<10-7,Penny>如果这话能让你感觉好点...
<10-7,Penny>You know, if it makes you feel any better...

425
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,670
<10-8,Sheldon>可能不会
<10-8,Sheldon>It probably won't.

426
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,770
<10-9,Penny>你可能是对的
<10-9,Penny>You're probably right.

427
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,840
<10-10,Amy>谢尔顿  今晚夜色不错
<10-10,Amy>Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

428
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,440
<10-10,Amy>我们出去散步好吗
<10-10,Amy>Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?

429
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,200
<10-11,Sheldon>你这人怎么整天淫虫上脑啊
<10-11,Sheldon>Oh, everything is just sex with you isn't it?

430
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,120
<10-12,Raj>谢尔顿  你得意识到
<10-12,Raj>Sheldon, I think you might find the support

431
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,720
<10-12,Raj>想在恋爱中得到多少扶持
<10-12,Raj>you're looking for, if you realize that

432
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,950
<10-12,Raj>全取决于自己有多少付出
<10-12,Raj>relationships are a give and take.

433
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,320
<10-12,Raj>你有多支持她
<10-12,Raj>She can only be there for you

434
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,410
<10-12,Raj>她也会有多支持你
<10-12,Raj>as much as you are for her.

435
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,080
<10-13,Amy>谢谢你  拉杰什
<10-13,Amy>Thank you, Rajesh.

436
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,460
<10-14,Raj>艾米  你对待谢尔顿也要有耐心
<10-14,Raj>And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon,

437
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,480
<10-14,Raj>而不是对他施压
<10-14,Raj>instead of pressuring him

438
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,250
<10-14,Raj>让他接受你的这一套亲密观
<10-14,Raj>to accept intimacy on your terms.

439
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,270
<10-14,Raj>你还是走人吧
<10-14,Raj>You should probably go.

440
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,240
<11-1,Ira>我是艾拉·菲莱  这里是《科学星期五》节目
<11-1,Ira>I'm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday.

<11-1,Ira>who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element

443
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,470
<11-1,Ira>不料却被另一位嘉宾莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
<11-1,Ira>only to have it disproved by my next guest,

444
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,650
<11-1,Ira>证明是错的
<11-1,Ira>Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

447
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,610
<11-3,Sheldon>艾拉  容我说一句  我想为
<11-3,Sheldon>Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,250
<11-3,Sheldon>我上周的行为道歉

<11-5,Sheldon>Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?

451
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,920
<11-5,Sheldon>没有
<11-5,Sheldon>No.

452
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,350
<11-6,Ira>霍夫斯塔德博士
<11-6,Ira>Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

453
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,720
<11-6,Ira>你能讲述一遍你推翻
<11-6,Ira>Can you walk us through the process

454
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,890
<11-6,Ira>他理论的实验过程吗
<11-6,Ira>you used to disprove his theory?

455
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,400
<11-8,Sheldon>-好的  -我可以回答这个问题
<11-8,Sheldon>- Well... - I believe I can answer that.

456
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,730
<11-9,Leonard>他问的是我
<11-9,Leonard>He asked me.

457
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,780
<11-10,Sheldon>好的
<11-10,Sheldon>Fine.

458
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,680
<11-11,Leonard>我刚才在说
<11-11,Leonard>As I was saying...

459
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,350
<11-12,Sheldon>你讲得不好  艾拉
<11-12,Sheldon>You're telling it wrong. Ira...

460
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,360
<11-12,Sheldon>要想好好理解这件事
<11-12,Sheldon>to really understand the story here,

461
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,040
<11-12,Sheldon>就得从最开始讲起
<11-12,Sheldon>you have to start at the very beginning:

462
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,900
<11-12,Sheldon>在东德州的一个小镇  一位年幼的天才叫做
<11-12,Sheldon>A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named...

463
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,080
<11-14,Sheldon>-谢尔顿  -没错  谢尔顿·库珀
<11-14,Sheldon>- Sheldon... - That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

464
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,080
<11-14,Sheldon>他被邻居家的狗咬了
<11-14,Sheldon>He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

465
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,040
<11-14,Sheldon>这让他有了第一次科学方面的大突破
<11-14,Sheldon>leading to his first scientific breakthrough--

466
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,390
<11-14,Sheldon>狗狗死亡射线
<11-14,Sheldon>the doggie death-ray.

467
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,620
<11-14,Sheldon>可悲的是  他不能使之成为现实
<11-14,Sheldon>Which, sadly, he couldn't build

468
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,820
<11-14,Sheldon>因为圣诞老人没有送他浓缩铀
<11-14,Sheldon>because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.

469
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
<11-15,Ira>你没意见的话  我真的很想听
<11-15,Ira>I mean, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

470
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,840
<11-15,Ira>霍夫斯塔德博士说说
<11-15,Ira>if it's okay with you.

471
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,400
<11-16,Sheldon>好意外啊
<11-16,Sheldon>What a surprise.

472
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,360
<11-16,Sheldon>你邀请我回来  就是为了无视我吗
<11-16,Sheldon>Did-did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?

473
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,930
<11-17,Ira>事实上  我根本没有邀请你
<11-17,Ira>Actually, I didn't invite you.

474
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,330
<11-17,Ira>你走进来  自己坐下
<11-17,Ira>You came in, you took a seat,

475
