1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,090
<1-1,Leonard>我知道你们不想弄这事
<1-1,Leonard>Look, I know you guys don't want to do this,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,230
<1-1,Leonard>但我们没得选好吗
<1-1,Leonard>but we have no choice.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,600
<1-1,Leonard>你们大可以唧唧歪歪  浪费时间
<1-1,Leonard>So, you can either bitch and whine

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,100
<1-1,Leonard>也可以通力合作  早点搞定
<1-1,Leonard>or we can just get it over with.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,000
<1-2,Howard>我负责唧唧
<1-2,Howard>I got "whine."

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,690
<1-3,Sheldon>我负责歪歪
<1-3,Sheldon>I got the "b word."

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,570
<1-4,Leonard>我们与学校的合约中
<1-4,Leonard>Yeah, well, it's in our contract

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,110
<1-4,Leonard>注明了得为大学委员会服务
<1-4,Leonard>to serve on a university committee.

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,680
<1-4,Leonard>老实说  我也认同这件事
<1-4,Leonard>And frankly, this is one I believe in.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,690
<1-4,Leonard>主题就是
<1-4,Leonard>Okay, here we go.

11
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,790
<1-4,Leonard>鼓励更多女性加入科学领域
<1-4,Leonard>Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.

12
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,020
<1-5,Howard>拜托  我要有本事说服女人
<1-5,Howard>Come on, if I was any good

13
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,400
<1-5,Howard>去做我想她们做的事
<1-5,Howard>at convincing women to do stuff,

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,430
<1-5,Howard>那我20多岁时  就不用常自己在浴室"自乐"了
<1-5,Howard>I wouldn't have spent so much of my 20s in the shower.

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,110
<1-6,Sheldon>要我说的话
<1-6,Sheldon>If you ask me,

16
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,260
<1-6,Sheldon>搞这事根本只是浪费时间
<1-6,Sheldon>this whole thing is a waste of our time.

17
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,390
<1-7,Leonard>帮助女性浪费时间吗
<1-7,Leonard>Helping women?

18
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,400
<1-8,Sheldon>帮人就是浪费时间
<1-8,Sheldon>Yeah, helping anyone.

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,490
<1-8,Sheldon>人们应该自己照顾自己
<1-8,Sheldon>People should take care of themselves.

20
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,980
<1-9,Leonard>比如像昨天
<1-9,Leonard>Oh, like yesterday,

21
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,270
<1-9,Leonard>你叫我载你去干洗店
<1-9,Leonard>when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners,

22
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,180
<1-9,Leonard>药店跟邮局那样吗
<1-9,Leonard>the pharmacy and the post office?

23
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,560
<1-10,Sheldon>我又没说人们不能使用工具
<1-10,Sheldon>I'm not saying people can't use tools.

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,090
<1-10,Sheldon>连水獭想吃蛤蜊时都知道用石头敲开了
<1-10,Sheldon>Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.

25
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,960
<1-11,Leonard>你觉得花时间
<1-11,Leonard>You don't think it's worthwhile

26
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,380
<1-11,Leonard>让更多女性加入科学行业不好吗
<1-11,Leonard>to try to get more women working in science.

27
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,750
<1-12,Sheldon>我觉得你太有性别歧视了
<1-12,Sheldon>I think that's incredibly sexist of you.

28
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,130
<1-12,Sheldon>我相信在性别平等的社会
<1-12,Sheldon>I believe in a gender-blind society

29
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,630
<1-12,Sheldon>比如《星际迷航》中  各个种族
<1-12,Sheldon>like in Star Trek, where women and men

30
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,560
<1-12,Sheldon>信仰各异的男女都平等地一起共事
<1-12,Sheldon>of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,830
<1-13,Leonard>你是说那个先进到能发明出
<1-13,Leonard>You mean where they were advanced enough

32
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,830
<1-13,Leonard>能进行恒星际旅行的曲速引擎
<1-13,Leonard>to invent an interstellar warp drive,

33
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,660
<1-13,Leonard>却还是让一个黑人女性接太空电话的世界吗
<1-13,Leonard>but a black lady still answered the space phone?

34
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,680
<1-14,Howard>我的浴室"自乐"时间有不少是跟
<1-14,Howard>Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,760
<1-14,Howard>乌乎拉通讯官度过的
<1-14,Howard>with Lieutenant Uhura.

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,060
<1-15,Sheldon>先不管霍华德的下流回忆
<1-15,Sheldon>Howard's disturbing recollections aside,

37
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,880
<1-15,Sheldon>我不喜欢被逼去做这些
<1-15,Sheldon>I don't appreciate being forced to do

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,340
<1-15,Sheldon>平庸的委员会工作
<1-15,Sheldon>banal committee work.

39
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,960
<1-16,Leonard>是是是  太大材小用了
<1-16,Leonard>Yes, I know, you're too smart for this.

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,920
<1-16,Leonard>没错
<1-16,Leonard>Exactly.

41
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,550
<1-17,Sheldon>就跟叫霹雳火
<1-17,Sheldon>It's like asking the Human Torch

43
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,550
<1-17,Sheldon>来热你的冷冻玉米煎饼一样
<1-17,Sheldon>to heat up your frozen burrito.

44
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,360
<1-18,Leonard>明白
<1-18,Leonard>Got it.

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,470
<1-18,Leonard>我想到了一个
<1-18,Leonard>All right, I'm thinking one way

46
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,880
<1-18,Leonard>避免在同行评审阶段遭受歧视的方法
<1-18,Leonard>to counter bias in the peer-review process,

47
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,690
<1-18,Leonard>就是报告都用中性名字递交
<1-18,Leonard>is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names.

48
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,130
<1-18,Leonard>比如S·史密斯
<1-18,Leonard>Like S. Smith

49
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,360
<1-18,Leonard>而不是沙曼莎·史密斯
<1-18,Leonard>instead of Samantha Smith.

50
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,130
<1-19,Sheldon>专业领域的某些女性使用缩写名
<1-19,Sheldon>I suppose there is a history of professional women

51
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,800
<1-19,Sheldon>来避免先入为主的批判  的确行之有年了
<1-19,Sheldon>using their initials, so as not to be pre-judged.

52
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,250
<1-19,Sheldon>《哈利波特》作者  J.K.罗琳
<1-19,Sheldon>Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling,

53
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,200

<1-19,Sheldon>uh, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,970
<1-20,Howard>范奈斯市的钢管舞女  DD杯·麦伦[巨乳]
<1-20,Howard>Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons.

55
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,940
<1-20,Howard>好啦  我们今天有帮到女性了
<1-20,Howard>All right, I think we've really helped women today.

56
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,400
<1-20,Howard>来打电动吧
<1-20,Howard>Let's fire up the old Xbox.

57
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,970
<1-21,Leonard>你们俩  拜托别让历史重演
<1-21,Leonard>Guys, please don't make this a school project

58
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,450
<1-21,Leonard>小时候做报告  聪明孩子做全部
<1-21,Leonard>where I'm the smart kid doing all the work

59
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,190
<1-21,Leonard>其他懒鬼就在旁边看着
<1-21,Leonard>while the slackers sit back and watch.

60
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,020
<1-21,Leonard>我们才不是呢
<1-21,Leonard>No, we're not.

61
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,070
<1-22,Sheldon>这次是聪明孩子负责做全部工作
<1-22,Sheldon>This time you're the smart kid doing all the work

62
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,930
<1-22,Sheldon>而更聪明的孩子在旁边看着
<1-22,Sheldon>while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,900
<1-23,Howard>你觉得我也是更聪明的孩子吗
<1-23,Howard>So, you think I'm one of the smarter kids?

64
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,720
<1-24,Sheldon>不是  你只是我用来证明论点的工具
<1-24,Sheldon>No, you're a tool I was using to make my point.

65

<2-1,Leonard>我们的主题是"鼓励女性加入科学领域"
<2-1,Leonard>Guys, our topic is "Encouraging Women in Science."

67
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,870
<2-1,Leonard>你们俩不能玩少点性别歧视的游戏吗
<2-1,Leonard>Can you at least play a less sexist game?

68
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,260
<2-2,Sheldon>这哪有歧视女性
<2-2,Sheldon>How is it sexist?

69
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,400
<2-2,Sheldon>我的角色能像男人一样把大战锤挥起来
<2-2,Sheldon>My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.

70
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,630
<2-3,Howard>更别说她有着超发达的乳腺
<2-3,Howard>Not to mention she has mammary glands

71
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,770
<2-3,Howard>足够喂养一家三十口
<2-3,Howard>that could nurse a family of 30.

72
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,620

<2-3,Howard>And have enough milk left over

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,850
<2-3,Howard>都够开冰激凌店用了

<2-4,Sheldon>母亲  战士公主  冰激凌加盟店老板

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,750
<2-4,Sheldon>女性职场障碍全被打爆啊
<2-4,Sheldon>I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.

76
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,650
<2-5,Leonard>谢尔顿  你老说
<2-5,Leonard>Sheldon, you're always saying

77
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,310
<2-5,Leonard>你比我聪明无数倍
<2-5,Leonard>how much smarter you are than me.

78
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,570
<2-5,Leonard>那你能用五秒钟想出一个
<2-5,Leonard>Spend five seconds and come up with one idea

79
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,590
<2-5,Leonard>能让更多女性加入科学领域的方法吗
<2-5,Leonard>on how to get more women into science.

80
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,810
<2-6,Sheldon>你的所有点子都仅限于学术界阶段的问题
<2-6,Sheldon>All your ideas address the issue at a university level.

81
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,870
<2-6,Sheldon>但那阶段已经太晚了
<2-6,Sheldon>By then it's too late.

82
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,690
<2-6,Sheldon>你应该设计一个扩展研究
<2-6,Sheldon>You need to design an outreach program

83
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,610
<2-6,Sheldon>把目标延伸到中学阶段的少女们
<2-6,Sheldon>that targets girls at the middle school level

84
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,480
<2-6,Sheldon>把她们导向追求学术
<2-6,Sheldon>and sets them on an academic track

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,950
<2-6,Sheldon>迈向硬科学的道路之上
<2-6,Sheldon>towards the hard sciences.

86
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,790
<2-7,Leonard>还真是个好点子
<2-7,Leonard>That's actually good.

87
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,470
<2-7,Leonard>我怎么就没想到呢
<2-7,Leonard>Why didn't I think of that?

88
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,790
<2-8,Sheldon>有些人是水獭  而有些人就只是石头
<2-8,Sheldon>Some people are otters, some people are rocks.

89
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,610
<2-9,Leonard>有没有什么方法
<2-9,Leonard>I wonder if there's a way

90
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,200
<2-9,Leonard>可以先试验一下这点子呢
<2-9,Leonard>we could give the idea a trial run.

91
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,740
<2-10,Howard>我可以试试打电话给我以前的中学
<2-10,Howard>Maybe I could call my old middle school,

92
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,290
<2-10,Howard>看我们能不能跟一些女学生聊聊
<2-10,Howard>see if we can talk to some of the female students.

93
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,750
<2-11,Leonard>这不错啊  安排一下
<2-11,Leonard>That's great-- try to set up something

94
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,180
<2-11,Leonard>让我们三个去那里试试
<2-11,Leonard>for the three of us to go over there.

95
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,330
<2-12,Sheldon>先等等吧
<2-12,Sheldon>Oh, hold on.

96
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,120
<2-12,Sheldon>虽然我对谈科学没有任何问题
<2-12,Sheldon>While I'm comfortable speaking about science,

97
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,180
<2-12,Sheldon>但我不确定能否勾起中学女孩的兴趣
<2-12,Sheldon>I'm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren.

98
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,930
<2-12,Sheldon>我先上网搜搜吧
<2-12,Sheldon>Better Google it.

99
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,020
<2-13,Howard>你打算搜什么关键句
<2-13,Howard>What exactly are you looking up?

100
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,090
<2-14,Sheldon>"如何让12岁少女兴[性]奋"
<2-14,Sheldon>"How do I get 12-year-old girls excited."

101
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,650
<2-15,Leonard and Howard (together)>不要  快住手
<2-15,Leonard and Howard (together)>No! No!

102
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,400
<3-1,Raj>再次感谢你们让我参一脚"闺蜜之夜"
<3-1,Raj>Thanks again for letting me crash "girls' night."

103
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,250
<3-2,Penny>开什么玩笑
<3-2,Penny>Are you kidding?

104
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,380
<3-2,Penny>你带来上好的红酒  还给我们做芝士火锅
<3-2,Penny>You brought fancy wine and made fondue.

105
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,900
<3-2,Penny>比这小的好处我都"睡"过了
<3-2,Penny>I've slept with guys for less.

106
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,460
<3-2,Penny>开玩笑啦
<3-2,Penny>It's a joke.

107
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,970
<3-2,Penny>基于真实故事的玩笑
<3-2,Penny>Based on real events.

108
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,980
<3-3,Raj>总之  我希望可以
<3-3,Raj>Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh,

109
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,100
<3-3,Raj>向你们请教一下
<3-3,Raj>pick your brains a little.

110
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,010
<3-3,Raj>我周五要跟露西约会
<3-3,Raj>I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday

111
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,360
<3-3,Raj>我需要一个超棒的初次约会
<3-3,Raj>and I need a killer first date.

112
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,220
<3-4,Amy>进化生物学说  女人容易被
<3-4,Amy>Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted

113
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,340
<3-4,Amy>临危不乱的男人所吸引
<3-4,Amy>to a man who is steady in the face of danger,

114
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,630
<3-4,Amy>所以我建议去危险的地方
<3-4,Amy>so I recommend an unsafe environment.

115
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,950
<3-4,Amy>去贫民区破旧的酒吧
<3-4,Amy>Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks...

<3-4,Amy>去疯人院附近野餐
<3-4,Amy>picnic near a lunatic asylum...

117
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,280
<3-4,Amy>去贫民窟品酒
<3-4,Amy>a wine tasting on Skid Row.

118
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,050
<3-5,Raj>露西有社交焦虑症
<3-5,Raj>Eh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues.

119
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,490
<3-5,Raj>或许我们可以从简单点的地方着手
<3-5,Raj>Maybe we could start with something simpler.

120
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,310
<3-6,Bernadette>你何不带她去迪士尼乐园
<3-6,Bernadette>Why don't you take her to Disneyland?

121
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,660
<3-6,Bernadette>你们可以玩室内过山车
<3-6,Bernadette>You go on Space Mountain,

122
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,700
<3-6,Bernadette>两人处于黑暗中  她紧紧抓住你
<3-6,Bernadette>you're in the dark, she's holding onto you.

123
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,840
<3-7,Penny>但千万要记住
<3-7,Penny>Yeah, but you just have to remember,

124
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,150
<3-7,Penny>那比你想象中还快结束
<3-7,Penny>that ride is shorter than you think

125
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,460
<3-7,Penny>终点前还会给你俩拍照
<3-7,Penny>and they take a picture of you at the end,

126
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,920
<3-7,Penny>所以记得在那之前就穿回衣服
<3-7,Penny>so make sure you got your clothes back on.

127
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,630
<3-7,Penny>开玩笑啦
<3-7,Penny>It's a joke.

128
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,510
<3-8,Raj>基于真实故事的玩笑
<3-8,Raj>Based on real events.

129
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,800
<3-8,Raj>迪士尼乐园  我不知道该不该去
<3-8,Raj>Mm, Disneyland? I don't know.

130
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,150
<3-8,Raj>人挤人  还有奇怪的角色玩偶人四处游走
<3-8,Raj>With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around,

131
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,830
<3-8,Raj>会让我有一种在印度的错觉
<3-8,Raj>just reminds me too much of India.

132
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,680
<3-9,Amy>我从来没去过迪士尼
<3-9,Amy>I haven't been to Disneyland since I was a kid.

133
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,300
<3-9,Amy>真应该找个周末去玩玩
<3-9,Amy>We should definitely go one weekend.

134
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,760
<3-10,Bernadette>周末人太多了
<3-10,Bernadette>Weekends are too crowded.

135
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,520
<3-11,Penny>那就不去上班  工作日时去
<3-11,Penny>So, blow off work, go on a weekday.

136
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,810
<3-12,Amy>翘班吗
<3-12,Amy>Hooky?

137
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,990
<3-12,Amy>我这辈子连课都没翘过
<3-12,Amy>I've never played hooky in my life.

138
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,280
<3-12,Amy>我妈说翘课的女生最后都会
<3-12,Amy>My mom said that's how girls end up

139
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,030
<3-12,Amy>沉迷于大麻和爵士乐
<3-12,Amy>addicted to reefer and jazz music.

140
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,690
<3-13,Penny>其实翘课的女生更有可能在酒店
<3-13,Penny>It's more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel

141
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,220
<3-13,Penny>跟一个34岁的老头开房
<3-13,Penny>with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.

142
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,590
<3-14,Bernadette>也是玩笑吗
<3-14,Bernadette>Joke?

143
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,960
<3-15,Penny>我现在对此能一笑置之了
<3-15,Penny>I can laugh about it now.

144
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,060
<3-16,Bernadette>你们觉得怎么样
<3-16,Bernadette>So, what do you say?

145
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,210
<3-16,Bernadette>周五我们放下工作去迪士尼  好吗
<3-16,Bernadette>This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?

146
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,390
<3-17,Penny>我赞成

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,050
<3-19,Raj>打断一下
<3-19,Raj>Excuse me,

<3-19,Raj>你们不是要帮忙解决我的问题吗
<3-19,Raj>I thought we were trying to solve my problem?

<3-20,Penny>等下  你的问题是什么来着
<3-20,Penny>Wait, what was your problem again?

152
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,440
<3-21,Raj>我是一个无法跟女性正常交流的男人
<3-21,Raj>I am a man who can't talk to women,

153
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,320
<3-21,Raj>试图想出
<3-21,Raj>trying to figure out

<3-21,Raj>如何跟一个患有严重社交焦虑症
<3-21,Raj>how to go on a romantic date with a girl

155
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,080
<3-21,Raj>而无法跟人共处的女孩

158
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,550
<3-23,Bernadette>我们好好想想

<5-9,Penny>We're not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,520
<5-18,Bernadette>你们两个小贱货要是有意见

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,610
<7-1,Leonard>我是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
<7-1,Leonard>Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

239
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,610
<7-1,Leonard>这是我的朋友库珀博士

<7-1,Leonard>我们会为你们展现
<7-1,Leonard>and we are going to show you girls

242
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,150
<7-1,Leonard>科学工作会有多酷
<7-1,Leonard>how cool a job in science can be.

243
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,590
<7-1,Leonard>你们问有多酷[冷]是吗
<7-1,Leonard>How cool, you ask?

244
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,700
<7-1,Leonard>大概有零下273度[绝对零度]
<7-1,Leonard>Well, how about negative 273 degrees,

246
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,560
<7-1,Leonard>因为那是熵达到其最小值时的温度
<7-1,Leonard>'cause that's the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value.

247
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,200
<7-1,Leonard>我刚才是开心地学到新知识了吗
<7-1,Leonard>Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it?

248
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,050
<7-1,Leonard>还有这种好事
<7-1,Leonard>What?

249

254
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,030
<7-2,Sheldon>伟大的女性科学家的故事来激励你们
<7-2,Sheldon>with a story about a great female scientist.

255
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,580
<7-2,Sheldon>在波兰出生  在法国接受教育的
<7-2,Sheldon>Polish-born, French-educated

<7-2,Sheldon>she was a hero of science...

259
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,680
<7-2,Sheldon>直到她的头发掉光
<7-2,Sheldon>until her hair fell out;

260
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,080
<7-2,Sheldon>吐血和大便带血
<7-2,Sheldon>her vomit and stool became filled with blood...

261
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,660
<7-2,Sheldon>她被自己的发现毒死了
<7-2,Sheldon>and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery.

262
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,860
<7-2,Sheldon>只要勤奋努力
<7-2,Sheldon>With a little hard work,

263
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,470
<7-2,Sheldon>你们一定都能获得她的成果
<7-2,Sheldon>I see no reason why that can't happen to any of you.

264
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,640
<7-2,Sheldon>结束了没  我们能走了吗
<7-2,Sheldon>Are we done? Can we go?

<7-4,Girl>你去月球了吗
<7-4,Girl>Did you go to the moon?

272
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,020
<7-5,Howard>没有  但我确实去了

<7-6,Girl>没有
<7-6,Girl>No,

276
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,450
<7-7,Howard>但我确实乘坐了火箭

277
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,270
<7-7,Howard>我没有
<7-7,Howard>I didn't actually...

278
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,880
<7-8,Girl>所以你就是飞而已  和我叔叔很像
<7-8,Girl>So you just flew around? That's kind of like my uncle.

279
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,770
<7-8,Girl>他是个空乘员
<7-8,Girl>He's a flight attendant.

<7-9,Howard>Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?

283
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,820
<7-10,Leonard>我们学到了很多是吧
<7-10,Leonard>Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh?

284
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
<7-10,Leonard>谢谢你  霍华德宇航员
<7-10,Leonard>Thank you, Astronaut Howard.

285
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,070
<7-10,Leonard>我是一名实验物理学家
<7-10,Leonard>Um, I am what's called an experimental physicist,

286
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,700
<7-10,Leonard>我的工作特别好玩  因为我能测试证明理论
<7-10,Leonard>which is super-fun, because I get to test theories

287
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,320
<7-10,Leonard>工作还能跟激光打交道
<7-10,Leonard>and work with lasers.

288
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,390
<7-10,Leonard>请讲
<7-10,Leonard>Yes?

289
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,470
<7-11,Girl 2>你是怎么决定当个科学家的
<7-11,Girl 2>How did you decide to become a scientist?

290
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,240
<7-12,Leonard>这问题提得好
<7-12,Leonard>Uh, excellent question.

291
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,110
<7-12,Leonard>我从小就喜欢科学
<7-12,Leonard>Um, I suppose I've always been into science, you know...

292
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,930
<7-12,Leonard>我的妈妈爸爸都是科学家
<7-12,Leonard>My mother and father are scientists,

293
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,650
<7-12,Leonard>所以他们一直引导我走上这条路
<7-12,Leonard>so I was kind of led in that direction.

294
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,750
<7-12,Leonard>我是被逼的  这种形容更恰当
<7-12,Leonard>Eh, pushed might be a better way to describe it.

295
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,520
<7-12,Leonard>说句实话
<7-12,Leonard>To be honest with you guys,

296
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,820
<7-12,Leonard>我在你们这么大的时候
<7-12,Leonard>when I was your age,

297
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,690
<7-12,Leonard>我想当的是说唱明星
<7-12,Leonard>I wanted to be a rap star.

298
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,320
<7-12,Leonard>像史诺普·道格一样

<7-12,Leonard>史诺普·道格  美国说唱歌手
<7-12,Leonard>犯有私藏枪支和大麻罪

300
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,150
<7-12,Leonard>但是对警方更为尊重
<7-12,Leonard>but with a healthy respect for the police.

301
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,050
<7-12,Leonard>没关系  你们笑吧
<7-12,Leonard>Yeah, no, sure, you laugh.

302
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,680
<7-12,Leonard>我妈也笑了
<7-12,Leonard>Just like my mother did.

303
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,550
<7-12,Leonard>* 我对她坦诚相告 *
<7-12,Leonard>* After I confided, *

304
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,920
<7-12,Leonard>* 她对我责备嘲笑 *
<7-12,Leonard>* I was derided and chided, *

305
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,210
<7-12,Leonard>* 我们俩碰撞引爆 *
<7-12,Leonard>* my moms and I collided. *

306
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,620
<7-12,Leonard>* 她说我路走歪掉 *
<7-12,Leonard>* She said my dreams were misguided. *

307
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,070
<7-12,Leonard>随便即兴说唱两句
<7-12,Leonard>That's just a little freestyle.

<8-3,Raj (by text)><i>真是个合适的[双关]惩罚</i>
<8-3,Raj (by text)>That's a fitting pun-ishment.

316

<9-1,Leonard>I never wanted to play the cello.

333
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,070
<9-1,Leonard>拉大提琴怎么泡得到女孩啊

<9-1,Leonard>that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"

337
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,660
<9-2,Howard>赶紧去拉响火警报警器

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,110
<9-2,Howard>好让咱们趁机溜走
<9-2,Howard>Let's get out of here.

339
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,620
<9-3,Sheldon>各位  再次问好
<9-3,Sheldon>Uh, hello again.

340
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,400
<9-3,Sheldon>我不知道是不是所有的女人
<9-3,Sheldon>Um, yeah, I don't know if women in general

341
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,260
<9-3,Sheldon>都被人主动劝阻过
<9-3,Sheldon>have been actively discouraged

342
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,110
<9-3,Sheldon>不要追求科学
<9-3,Sheldon>from pursuing the sciences,

343
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,650
<9-3,Sheldon>但很显然  今天你们这些女孩都被劝阻了
<9-3,Sheldon>but it's clear you young women here, today, have been.

344
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,320
<9-3,Sheldon>我听着我同事们废话连篇浪费你们的时间
<9-3,Sheldon>While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time,

345
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,790
<9-3,Sheldon>我突然想到  如果让真实的科学女强人
<9-3,Sheldon>it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful

346
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,090
<9-3,Sheldon>为你们讲述女人投身科学的事迹
<9-3,Sheldon>to hear about women in science

347
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,660
<9-3,Sheldon>这样也许更有意义
<9-3,Sheldon>from actual women in science,

348
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,670
<9-3,Sheldon>我碰巧认识两位科学女强人
<9-3,Sheldon>and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples

349
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,940
<9-3,Sheldon>她们同意现在和你们进行电话交流
