<1-2,Leonard>想听一个有关黄芥末的有趣知识吗
<1-2,Leonard>Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?

<1-7,Leonard>你们早到了
<1-7,Leonard>Hey, you're early.

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,220
<1-7,Leonard>电影还有一个小时才开始呢
<1-7,Leonard>The movie doesn't start for an hour.

13
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,580
<1-8,Howard>其实我们不去看电影了
<1-8,Howard>Actually, we're not going to the movies.

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,300
<1-8,Howard>我们是来绑架你的
<1-8,Howard>We are here to kidnap you.

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,400
<1-9,Leonard>你们说什么呢
<1-9,Leonard>What are you talking about?

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,530
<1-10,Raj>你跟佩妮私定终身
<1-10,Raj>Well, you eloped and we didn't get a chance

17
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,890
<1-10,Raj>我们没机会给你办单身汉派对
<1-10,Raj>to throw you a bachelor party,

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,540
<1-10,Raj>所以现在楼下有一台面包车
<1-10,Raj>so there's a van downstairs

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,820
<1-10,Raj>而我们上来要押你去
<1-10,Raj>and we're here to take you

20
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,590
<1-10,Raj>一个神秘地点过周末
<1-10,Raj>to a surprise location for the weekend.

21
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,450
<1-11,Sheldon>这算哪门子绑架
<1-11,Sheldon>Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping.

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,560
<1-11,Sheldon>眼罩呢
<1-11,Sheldon>Where's the blindfold?

23
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,080
<1-11,Sheldon>封嘴的胶布呢
<1-11,Sheldon>Where's the duct tape?

24
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,940
<1-11,Sheldon>给我打电话要求付赎金
<1-11,Sheldon>Where's the part where you call me and demand ransom

25
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,190
<1-11,Sheldon>然后我试图拖延通话时间
<1-11,Sheldon>and I try to keep you on the phone,

26
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,970
<1-11,Sheldon>你们却在定位成功的前几秒挂了
<1-11,Sheldon>but you hang up seconds before I can trace it

27
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,280
<1-11,Sheldon>让我说出"我太老了  力不从心了"的桥段呢
<1-11,Sheldon>and then I say, "I'm getting too old for this crud"?

29
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,860
<1-12,Leonard>我们什么时候能走人
<1-12,Leonard>When do we leave?

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,000
<1-13,Howard>现在
<1-13,Howard>Right now.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,460
<1-14,Raj>佩妮给你打包好行李了
<1-14,Raj>Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.

32
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,000
<1-15,Howard>走起
<1-15,Howard>Wow, okay.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,540
<1-16,Sheldon>你真的要上一台面包车
<1-16,Sheldon>You're seriously going to get in a van

34
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,560
<1-16,Sheldon>让这俩家伙带你到神秘地点
<1-16,Sheldon>and let these two take you to an unknown destination

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,810
<1-16,Sheldon>一整个周末吗
<1-16,Sheldon>for an entire weekend?

36
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,790
<1-17,Raj>不只是他  你也得来
<1-17,Raj>Oh, not just him; you're coming, too.

37
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,290
<1-18,Sheldon>你凭啥觉得我会乖乖配合
<1-18,Sheldon>Oh, and how do you think you're going to get me to do that?

38
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,260
<2-1,Sheldon>放开我
<2-1,Sheldon>Unhand me!

39
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,580
<2-1,Sheldon>这太扯了
<2-1,Sheldon>This is ridiculous!

40
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,370
<2-2,Howard>我说了让你用胶带封住他的嘴
<2-2,Howard>I told you to put tape on his mouth!

41
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,550
<2-3,Raj>我也说了这货咬我
<2-3,Raj>And I told you he bit me!

42
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,130
<2-3,Raj>翻译：赛太公一脚踹飞  YY猫满地找牙
<2-3,Raj>猫王也在帮忙找  别扭大菜

52
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,240
<2-3,Raj>我被人强押上车已经够惨了
<2-3,Raj>It's bad enough I'm being taken against my will.

53
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,110
<2-3,Raj>为什么这车还偏偏是
<2-3,Raj>I don't see why it has to be in

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,120
<3-1,Sheldon>某个嬉皮士的移动炮房
<3-1,Sheldon>some hippie's mobile sex dungeon.

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,500
<3-2,Howard>谢尔顿  这台车另有玄机哦
<3-2,Howard>Well, Sheldon, there's something about this van

56
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,050
<3-2,Howard>你绝对会很感兴趣
<3-2,Howard>that you're going to find very interesting.

57
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,320
<3-3,Sheldon>它是以梅毒为动力的吗
<3-3,Sheldon>It runs on syphilis?

58
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,810
<3-4,Raj>这台车的主人曾是你
<3-4,Raj>This van was owned and driven by your personal

59
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,170
<3-4,Raj>物理界的偶像
<3-4,Raj>physics hero...

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,730
<3-4,Raj>理查德·费曼
<3-4,Raj>Richard Feynman.

61
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,970
<3-4,Raj>美国物理学家  1965年获诺贝尔物理奖
<3-4,Raj>曾被评选为有史以来最伟大的物理学家之一

62
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,970
<3-5,Sheldon>-不可能  -是真的
<3-5,Sheldon>- No. - Yeah!

63
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,350
<3-6,Howard>我一个朋友借我开的
<3-6,Howard>A buddy of mine let me borrow it.

64
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,780
<3-7,Leonard>这曾是费曼的车吗
<3-7,Leonard>This was Feynman's van?

65
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,900
<3-7,Leonard>太酷了
<3-7,Leonard>That's so cool.

66
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,080
<3-8,Raj>而且还维持着他开它时的原貌呢
<3-8,Raj>Yeah, nothing's been changed since he drove it.

67
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,960
<3-9,Howard>我猜他用这台屌车泡过不少可爱研究生
<3-9,Howard>I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.

68
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,320
<3-10,Sheldon>还在车上跟她们聊了物理

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,180
<3-12,Raj>行  我想想啊
<3-12,Raj>Uh, okay, let's see...

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,760
<3-12,Raj>那里有辣的食物
<3-12,Raj>They've got spicy food

72
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,800
<3-12,Raj>而且你有可能会腹泻
<3-12,Raj>and there's a chance you'll get diarrhea.

73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,130
<3-13,Leonard>印度

<3-17,Leonard>Fun, I've never been there!

78
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,260
<3-18,Sheldon>莱纳德  别被他们骗了
<3-18,Sheldon>Leonard, don't be fooled!

79

<3-18,Sheldon>我是德州人
<3-18,Sheldon>I'm from Texas--

80
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,860
<3-18,Sheldon>墨喜哥是西语的墨西哥
<3-18,Sheldon>Meh-he-co is Spanish for Mexico.

81
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,900
<3-19,Raj>墨西哥哪里不好
<3-19,Raj>What's wrong with Mexico?

82
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,920
<3-20,Sheldon>烦人墨西哥街头乐队  野狗
<3-20,Sheldon>Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs,

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,100
<3-20,Sheldon>因为里面有虫  而能跳动的墨西哥跳豆
<3-20,Sheldon>beans that jump around 'cause there's a worm inside.

<3-21,Howard>冷静好吗
<3-21,Howard>Okay, calm down.

86
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,200
<3-21,Howard>我们要开着费曼的车去墨西哥
<3-21,Howard>We are going to Mexico in Feynman's van

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,840
<3-21,Howard>还要住在费曼用诺贝尔奖奖金
<3-21,Howard>to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,130
<3-21,Howard>买下来的度假别墅
<3-21,Howard>with the money from his Nobel Prize.

89
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,440
<3-22,Sheldon>泄停封万岁
<3-22,Sheldon>Viva la Imodium!

<4-1,Bernadette>去嘛  莱纳德去过单身汉派对
<4-1,Bernadette>Come on, Leonard's doing bachelor stuff.

<4-1,Bernadette>你确定不要我们带你去牛郎舞厅吗
<4-1,Bernadette>You sure we can't take you to a strip club?

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,580
<4-2,Penny>不用了  如果我想要看赤裸舞男
<4-2,Penny>Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man,

93
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,770
<4-2,Penny>等莱纳德洗澡时去冲马桶  就能吓得他乱蹦
<4-2,Penny>I just flush the toilet while Leonard's in the shower.

94
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,320
<4-5,Amy>我知道我们没有要大肆庆祝
<4-5,Amy>I know we're not making a fuss,

95
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,290
<4-5,Amy>但本着单身女郎派对的精神
<4-5,Amy>but in the spirit of bachelorette parties,

96
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,220
<4-5,Amy>我做了男人性器官形状的饼干
<4-5,Amy>I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.

97
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,740
<4-6,Penny>你不用那么麻烦...
<4-6,Penny>You really didn't have to...

103
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,080
<4-9,Amy>面团多了
<4-9,Amy>I had extra dough.

104
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,380
<4-10,Penny (reading text)>是莱纳德
<4-10,Penny (reading text)>Oh, that's Leonard.

105
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,100
<4-10,Penny (reading text)>他说马上要过边境了
<4-10,Penny (reading text)>He said they're about to cross the border.

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,110
<4-11,Bernadette>希望男生们在墨西哥不会玩太疯
<4-11,Bernadette>I hope the boys don't get too crazy in Mexico.

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,310
<4-12,Penny>是啊  大家快锁好家里女儿
<4-12,Penny>Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters

108
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,640
<4-12,Penny>否则淫贼谢尔顿
<4-12,Penny>or Sheldon might lecture them

109
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,910
<4-12,Penny>会教育她们有关北美自由贸易协议的事
<4-12,Penny>about the North American Free Trade Agreement.

110
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,360
<4-13,Amy>要命  那晚真是漫长啊
<4-13,Amy>Boy, that was a long night for me.

111
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,660
<5-1,Sheldon>根据这个墨西哥海关网站
<5-1,Sheldon>According to this Mexican Customs Web site,

112
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,720
<5-1,Sheldon>游客们不许携带超过五片激光光盘
<5-1,Sheldon>visitors may not bring more than five laser discs,

113
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,380
<5-1,Sheldon>二十片光盘
<5-1,Sheldon>20 compact discs

114
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,480
<5-1,Sheldon>或十二张录影带
<5-1,Sheldon>or 12 VHS tapes.

115
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,550
<5-2,Raj>我们没有带那些东西
<5-2,Raj>We don't have any of those.

116
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,000
<5-3,Sheldon>你怎么能确定
<5-3,Sheldon>How can you be sure?

117
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,040
<5-3,Sheldon>费曼开这台车的年代  录影带称霸天下
<5-3,Sheldon>VHS was king when Feynman drove this van.

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,980
<5-3,Sheldon>说不定这车上哪里有暗格
<5-3,Sheldon>For all we know, there are hidden compartments

119
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,420
<5-3,Sheldon>藏满了健美皇后简·方达的健身影带
<5-3,Sheldon>lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.

120
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,180
<5-4,Leonard>如果这车上有暗格
<5-4,Leonard>If there was a hidden compartment,

121
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,810
<5-4,Leonard>你不觉得你早就被塞进去了吗
<5-4,Leonard>don't you think you'd be stuffed in it by now?

122
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,970
<5-5,Sheldon>大家的黄热病疫苗还没过期吧
<5-5,Sheldon>Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?

124
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,000
<5-6,Howard>去墨西哥不需要接种黄热病疫苗
<5-6,Howard>You don't need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,660
<5-7,Sheldon>小心驶得万年船
<5-7,Sheldon>You can never be too careful.

126
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,100
<5-7,Sheldon>我去年去未来世界主题公园时就打了一针
<5-7,Sheldon>I got one last year before I went to Epcot.

128
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,410
<6-1,Amy>佩妮  婚后生活如何
<6-1,Amy>So, Penny, how's married life?

129
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,600
<6-1,Amy>还不错啊
<6-1,Amy>Oh, it's good.

130
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,530
<6-2,Penny>现在就希望莱纳德能鼓起勇气
<6-2,Penny>I just wish Leonard would work up the courage

131
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,830
<6-2,Penny>告诉谢尔顿他要搬来跟我住
<6-2,Penny>to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.

132
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,670
<6-3,Bernadette>你们俩还没住在一起吗
<6-3,Bernadette>You guys still aren't living together?

133
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,270
<6-4,Penny>住一起啊  但谢尔顿也睡这
<6-4,Penny>We are. I mean, he sleeps here.

134
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,860
<6-4,Penny>但说不准哪天
<6-4,Penny>But it's only a matter of time

135
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,340
<6-4,Penny>谢尔顿做了恶梦
<6-4,Penny>before Sheldon has a bad dream

136
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,200
<6-4,Penny>会抱着他的莱纳德人形抱枕爬上我们的床
<6-4,Penny>and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.

137
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,660
<6-5,Bernadette>说到谢尔顿
<6-5,Bernadette>Speaking of Sheldon,

138
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,380
<6-5,Bernadette>你的单身生活又如何
<6-5,Bernadette>how's single life treating you?

139
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,750
<6-6,Amy>还行吧
<6-6,Amy>Fine, I guess.

140
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,660
<6-6,Amy>我就专注在自己身上
<6-6,Amy>I've been focusing on me.

141
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,540
<6-6,Amy>我之前还在想要不要换下穿衣风格
<6-6,Amy>I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.

142
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,820
<6-8,Bernadette>-当然  -好样的
<6-8,Bernadette>- Yes! - Good for you!

143
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,150
<6-9,Amy>但我后来决定我才不要因为某个男人
<6-9,Amy>But then I decided I don't want to go changing who I am

144
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,880
<6-9,Amy>改变原本的自己
<6-9,Amy>just because of some man.

145
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
<6-8,Bernadette>-当然  -好样的
<6-8,Bernadette>- Yes. - Good for you.

146
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,620
<6-12,Penny>很多人
<6-12,Penny>You know, it is normal

147
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,790
<6-12,Penny>在分手之后都会想改头换面
<6-12,Penny>to want to change your look after a breakup.

148
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,350
<6-13,Amy>其实我在考虑做一个小小的改变
<6-13,Amy>Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.

149
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,170
<6-14,Bernadette>-换毛衣  -换眼镜
<6-14,Bernadette>- Your sweater? - Your glasses?

150
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,140
<6-16,Bernadette>-换发型  -换鞋子
<6-16,Bernadette>- Your hair? - Your shoes!

151
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,140
<6-18,Amy>穿耳洞
<6-18,Amy>Piercing my ears.

152
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,370
<6-19,Penny>你以前从来没穿过吗
<6-19,Penny>You really never had that done?

153
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,480
<6-21,Amy>我妈说穿耳洞的人不是妓女
<6-21,Amy>My mom said pierced ears were for whores,

154
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,940
<6-21,Amy>就是海盗和妖怪
<6-21,Amy>pirates and genies.

155
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,720
<6-22,Penny>好吧  你现在都是大人了
<6-22,Penny>Okay, well, you're a grown woman now.

156
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,230
<6-23,Amy>我知道  但谢尔顿在
<6-23,Amy>I know, but Sheldon had this clause

157
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,560
<6-23,Amy>《恋爱协议》里
<6-23,Amy>in the Relationship Agreement

158
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,850
<6-23,Amy>明文禁止做美容手术
<6-23,Amy>forbidding cosmetic surgery

159
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,380
<6-23,Amy>除非做出来效果像克林贡人
<6-23,Amy>unless it's to look like a Klingon.

160
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,690
<6-24,Bernadette>我们带你去商场里做就好啦
<6-24,Bernadette>We'll take you to the mall to get it done.

161
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,200
<6-25,Penny>干嘛  我在这就能帮她做
<6-25,Penny>Why? I can do it right here.

162
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,050
<6-25,Penny>是吗
<6-25,Penny>Really?

163
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,270
<6-26,Amy>-你有打耳洞的枪吗  -没有
<6-26,Amy>- You have a piercing gun? - No.

164
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,820
<6-27,Penny>用一根针和一颗冰块就能搞定
<6-27,Penny>All you need is a needle and an ice cube.

165
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,710
<6-27,Penny>我以前做过很多次啦
<6-27,Penny>I've done it, like, a dozen times.

166
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,840
<6-28,Amy>这样好吗
<6-28,Amy>Oh, I don't know.

167
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,570
<6-29,Penny>来嘛  我会很温柔的
<6-29,Penny>Oh, come on. I'll be gentle.

168
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,060
<6-29,Penny>让我来破你耳朵的处吧
<6-29,Penny>Let me take your ear virginity.

169
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,150
<6-30,Bernadette>这个派对感觉好奇怪
<6-30,Bernadette>This party's weird.

170
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,040
<7-1,Leonard>别开这么快
<7-1,Leonard>Hey, watch your speed.

171
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,440
<7-1,Leonard>听说墨西哥警察专找游客麻烦
<7-1,Leonard>I hear the Mexican police target tourists.

172
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,860
<7-2,Howard>别担心啦
<7-2,Howard>Oh, not a problem.

173
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,650
<7-2,Howard>如果发生什么事
<7-2,Howard>If anything goes down,

174
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,920
<7-2,Howard>我们就让库萨帕里坐到驾驶座上
<7-2,Howard>we just put Koothrappali in the driver's seat

175
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,160
<7-2,Howard>再给他弄顶墨西哥草帽戴上
<7-2,Howard>and slap a sombrero on his head.

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,440
<7-3,Raj>伙计  你一口气能激怒多少个种族
<7-3,Raj>Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?

177
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,520
<7-4,Howard>不晓得  你跟我一起看过奥林匹克运动会吗
<7-4,Howard>I don't know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?

178
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,620
<7-5,Leonard>谢尔顿  你能相信我们开的这辆面包车
<7-5,Leonard>Sheldon, can you believe that we're driving in a van that was owned by

179
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,720
<7-5,Leonard>曾属于20世纪最伟大的科学家之一吗
<7-5,Leonard>one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century?

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,630
<7-5,Leonard>简直就像蝙蝠战车
<7-5,Leonard>It's like the Batmobile.

181
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,740
<7-5,Leonard>前提是蝙蝠侠真实存在
<7-5,Leonard>If Batman was real

182
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,870
<7-5,Leonard>而且是一位物理学家
<7-5,Leonard>and a physicist

183
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,960
<7-5,Leonard>车还得不酷才行
<7-5,Leonard>and his car wasn't cool.

184
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,820
<7-6,Sheldon>这体验的确非比寻常
<7-6,Sheldon>It is extraordinary.

185
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,830
<7-7,Raj>或许这车能让我们沾上他的好运呢
<7-7,Raj>Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us.

186
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,700
<7-7,Raj>或许蹭蹭他的车和豪宅
<7-7,Raj>Maybe between this and his beach house,

187
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,740
<7-7,Raj>我们能被激励  成就大事
<7-7,Raj>we will be inspired to greatness.

188
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,270
<7-8,Sheldon>通常我不会对符咒或护身符寄予厚望
<7-8,Sheldon>I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans.

189
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,900
<7-8,Sheldon>然而我必须承认
<7-8,Sheldon>However, even I must admit

190
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,000
<7-8,Sheldon>自己的屁股坐在
<7-8,Sheldon>feeling Richard Feynman's butt dent

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,030
<7-8,Sheldon>理查德·费曼的屁股印上
<7-8,Sheldon>cupping my own bottom...

192
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,920
<7-8,Sheldon>真是让我创意如泉涌啊
<7-8,Sheldon>that does get the creative juices flowing.

193
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,910
<7-9,Howard>这车我还得还回去呢
<7-9,Howard>Hey, I have to return this van.

194
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,860
<7-9,Howard>麻烦不要让你的创意"喷射"出你的裤子
<7-9,Howard>Keep your creative juices in your pants.

195
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,970
<7-10,Sheldon>怎么回事
<7-10,Sheldon>What was that?

196
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,870
<7-11,Howard>可能爆胎了
<7-11,Howard>I think it's a tire.

197
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,230
<7-12,Sheldon>没准是土匪朝咱们开枪了
<7-12,Sheldon>What if it's banditos shooting at us?

198
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,710
<7-12,Sheldon>没准我们会被绑架
<7-12,Sheldon>What if we get kidnapped?

199
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,290
<7-12,Sheldon>没准我们余生会沦落到某个工厂
<7-12,Sheldon>What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson pinatas

200
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,450
<7-12,Sheldon>终日做卡通皮纳塔
<7-12,Sheldon>for the rest of our lives?!

201
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,450
<7-12,Sheldon>一种纸糊的容器  里面装满糖果与玩具
<7-12,Sheldon>在节庆或生日是挂空中  让人击打

202
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,080
<7-13,Howard>爆胎而已啦
<7-13,Howard>It's the tire.

203
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,870
<7-14,Sheldon>莱纳德
<7-14,Sheldon>Leonard?

204
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,090
<7-15,Leonard>干嘛
<7-15,Leonard>What?

205
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,080
<7-16,Sheldon>我太老了  力不从心了
<7-16,Sheldon>I am getting too old for this crud.

206
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,830
<8-1,Bernadette>艾米  我注意到你脸书的状态
<8-1,Bernadette>Amy, I noticed your status still says

207
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,170
<8-1,Bernadette>还是"恋爱中"
<8-1,Bernadette>"In a relationship" on Facebook.

208
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,370
<8-1,Bernadette>你说得对
<8-1,Bernadette>You're right.

209
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,660
<8-2,Amy>我应该通知我脸书上所有的朋友
<8-2,Amy>I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know.

210
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,280
<8-2,Amy>佩妮  我已经分手了
<8-2,Amy>Penny, I'm no longer in a relationship.

211
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,160
<8-3,Bernadette>你的状态改为"已婚"了吗
<8-3,Bernadette>Did you change yours to "Married" yet?

212
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,420
<8-4,Penny>还没
<8-4,Penny>Uh, no, not yet.

213
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,030
<8-4,Penny>有几个人我还没亲自告诉他们
<8-4,Penny>There's still a few people I haven't told personally.

214
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,100
<8-5,Amy>谁
<8-5,Amy>Who?

215
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,450
<8-6,Penny>就我爸妈
<8-6,Penny>Oh, just my parents

216
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,520
<8-6,Penny>和我全家人
<8-6,Penny>and my entire family.

217
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,720
<8-8,Amy>-什么  -为什么
<8-8,Amy>- What? - Why?

218
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,100
<8-9,Penny>我不想让我爸伤心
<8-9,Penny>Well, I don't want to hurt my dad.

219
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,020
<8-9,Penny>他一直梦想着
<8-9,Penny>You know, he always wanted

220
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,260
<8-9,Penny>在自己女儿的婚礼上跟她共舞
<8-9,Penny>to dance with his daughter at her wedding.

221
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,630
<8-10,Bernadette>那你姐姐的婚礼呢
<8-10,Bernadette>What about your sister's wedding?

222
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,070
<8-11,Penny>没跳两下她羊水就破了
<8-11,Penny>They started to, then her water broke.

223
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,500
<8-11,Penny>如果他发现我们私定终身了
<8-11,Penny>You know, if he finds out we eloped,

224
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,990
<8-11,Penny>我爸肯定心碎不已
<8-11,Penny>it's gonna break his heart.

225
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,080
<8-12,Amy>你觉得你能瞒他瞒多久
<8-12,Amy>How long do you think you can keep it from him?

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,540
<8-13,Bernadette>对啊  你瞒得越久不就越坏事吗
<8-13,Bernadette>Yeah, isn't it gonna get worse the longer you wait?

227
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,010
<8-14,Penny>不一定哦
<8-14,Penny>Well, not necessarily.

228
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,760
<8-14,Penny>我爸一天天在老去
<8-14,Penny>You know, Dad's not getting any younger,

229
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,340
<8-14,Penny>所以等到他年老不记事时
<8-14,Penny>so if I wait long enough,

230
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,250
<8-14,Penny>我就告诉他  当初是他陪我走红毯
<8-14,Penny>I'll just tell him he walked me down the aisle

231
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,900
<8-14,Penny>场面非常感人
<8-14,Penny>and it was magical.

232
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,810
<9-1,Raj>你什么时候学会换轮胎的
<9-1,Raj>When did you learn how to change a tire?

233
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,560
<9-2,Howard>任何一个有自尊心的绅士都应该知道这个
<9-2,Howard>Every self-respecting gentleman should know how

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,230
<9-2,Howard>以防哪天在路边遇到有一位
<9-2,Howard>in case he comes across a damsel in distress

235
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,900
<9-2,Howard>需要帮助的少女
<9-2,Howard>by the side of the road.

236
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,680
<9-3,Sheldon>如果我看见一个蝎子
<9-3,Sheldon>If I see one scorpion,

237
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,900
<9-3,Sheldon>我就跳上你们谁的肩膀
<9-3,Sheldon>I am getting on someone's shoulders

238
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,870
<9-3,Sheldon>永远都不下来
<9-3,Sheldon>and never coming down.

239
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,030
<9-4,Leonard>你遇到的是需要帮助的少男
<9-4,Leonard>And there's your damsel.

240
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,090
<9-5,Howard>这螺母卡得太死了
<9-5,Howard>Wow, this one's really stuck.

241
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,450
<9-6,Raj>你拧对方向了吗
<9-6,Raj>Are you turning it the right way?

242
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,590
<9-6,Raj>不
<9-6,Raj>No.

243
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,510
<9-7,Howard>我顺利拧下其他四个螺母后
<9-7,Howard>I took the other four off

244
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,970
<9-7,Howard>突然一拍脑袋  心想
<9-7,Howard>and when I got to this one, I thought,

245
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,560
<9-7,Howard>"太千篇一律了  换个方向试试吧"
<9-7,Howard>"You know, I'm in a rut. Let's shake things up."

246
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,340
<9-8,Raj>让我试试
<9-8,Raj>Here, let me try.

247
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,490
<9-8,Raj>你说得对  另一个方向也拧不动
<9-8,Raj>You're right, it doesn't turn the other way.

248
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,460
<10-1,Penny>好了  大功告成
<10-1,Penny>There you go. You're all done!

249
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,420
<10-2,Amy>没有想象中那么痛啊
<10-2,Amy>That wasn't so bad.

250
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,560
<10-2,Amy>真好看
<10-2,Amy>Nice.

251
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,310
<10-2,Amy>要是我妈现在看到我
<10-2,Amy>Boy, if my mom could see me now,

252
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,330
<10-2,Amy>她会把我锁进罪恶衣柜
<10-2,Amy>she'd lock me in the sin closet.

253
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,770
<10-3,Bernadette>你是开玩笑的吧
<10-3,Bernadette>That's a joke, right?

254
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,130
<10-4,Amy>其实  她才是那个笑话
<10-4,Amy>Actually, the joke was on her.

255
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,950
<10-4,Amy>因为我可以从柜门缝隙之间看到电视
<10-4,Amy>I could still see the TV through the slats.

256
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,390
<10-5,Penny>我开始明白你为啥和你妈不太亲近了
<10-5,Penny>I'm starting to see why you and your mom aren't very close.

257
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
<10-6,Bernadette>我打赌她结婚时还是会通知她妈
<10-6,Bernadette>Bet she'd still tell her if she got married.

258
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,870
<10-7,Penny>你就是不肯放过我  是吧
<10-7,Penny>You're not gonna let this go, are you?

259
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,690
<10-8,Amy>把他们蒙在鼓里是挺过分的
<10-8,Amy>Well, it's kind of sad that they don't know.

260
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,410
<10-8,Amy>他们多喜欢莱纳德啊
<10-8,Amy>I mean, they love Leonard.

261
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,200
<10-9,Penny>好吧  你们想让我打电话
<10-9,Penny>Fine, you want me to call?

262
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,480
<10-9,Penny>那我就打
<10-9,Penny>I'll call.

263
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,170
<10-9,Penny>我怎么这么紧张啊
<10-9,Penny>Why am I so nervous?

264
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,610
<10-10,Bernadette>这很正常
<10-10,Bernadette>It's understandable.

265
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,160
<10-10,Bernadette>艾米也很怕告诉她妈和谢尔顿分手的事
<10-10,Bernadette>Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.

266
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,490
<10-11,Penny>是吗  结果怎么样
<10-11,Penny>Yeah? How did it go?

267
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,270
<10-11,Penny>她逼着你爬进分手抽屉吗
<10-11,Penny>Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?

268
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,390
<10-12,Amy>老实说
<10-12,Amy>Uh, well, actually, to be honest...

269
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,210
<10-12,Amy>我还没告诉她呢
<10-12,Amy>I-I haven't told her yet.

270
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,630
<10-13,Penny>你这么起劲催着我
<10-13,Penny>You've been giving me a hard time

271
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,340
<10-13,Penny>而你自己却还没把分手的事告诉你妈
<10-13,Penny>and you haven't even told your mom about Sheldon?

272
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,430
<10-14,Amy>我失血过多  头好晕哦
<10-14,Amy>I'm feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss.

273
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,200
<10-14,Amy>我听不懂你在说什么
<10-14,Amy>I don't know what you're talking about.

274
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,480
<10-15,Penny>好吧  我给我家打电话
<10-15,Penny>Fine. I'm calling home,

275
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,980
<10-15,Penny>我打完以后  你给你妈打电话
<10-15,Penny>but when I'm done, you're calling your mother.

276
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,700
<10-16,Amy>你说得倒轻巧
<10-16,Amy>Easy for you to say.

277
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,260
<10-16,Amy>你又不需要这样偷偷摸摸地看《新闻60分》
<10-16,Amy>You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.

278
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,640
<10-17,Penny>爸爸
<10-17,Penny>Hey, Daddy.

279
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,150
<10-18,Penny’s Dad>帅妞
<10-18,Penny’s Dad>Hey, slugger.

280
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,190
<10-18,Penny’s Dad>你过得好吗
<10-18,Penny’s Dad>How's my girl?

281
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,970
<10-19,Penny>挺好  我妈在吗
<10-19,Penny>Uh, good. Is mom around?

282
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,130
<10-20,Penny’s Dad>她带你哥哥出去庆祝了
<10-20,Penny’s Dad>Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate.

283
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,600
<10-20,Penny’s Dad>他刚获得了他的第十个"一个月没喝酒"奖章
<10-20,Penny’s Dad>He just got his tenth one-month sober chip.

284
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,530
<10-20,Penny’s Dad>她要给他做个奖章小项链
<10-20,Penny’s Dad>Yeah, she's gonna make him a little necklace.

285
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,400
<10-21,Penny>我待会再打给她
<10-21,Penny>Okay, I'll talk to her later.

286
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,460
<10-21,Penny>爸爸  我有事要告诉你
<10-21,Penny>Uh, Dad, there's something I need to tell you.

287
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,720
<10-21,Penny>我和莱纳德结婚了
<10-21,Penny>Leonard and I got married.

288
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,990
<10-22,Penny’s Dad>真的吗
<10-22,Penny’s Dad>You did?

289
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,850
<10-22,Penny’s Dad>什么时候
<10-22,Penny’s Dad>When?

290
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,400
<10-23,Penny>上周  对不起  我应该早点告诉你
<10-23,Penny>Last week. I'm sorry, I should've told you.

291
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,960
<10-23,Penny>都怪我们一时冲动
<10-23,Penny>It was a spur of the moment thing.

292
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,740
<10-23,Penny>我觉得很愧疚
<10-23,Penny>I feel terrible.

293
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,250
<10-23,Penny>求求你不要对我失望
<10-23,Penny>Please don't be too disappointed.

294
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,800
<10-24,Penny’s Dad>你开心吗
<10-24,Penny’s Dad>Are you happy?

295
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,410
<10-24,Penny’s Dad>开心呀
<10-24,Penny’s Dad>Very.

296
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,440
<10-25,Penny>莱纳德是个非常棒的人
<10-25,Penny>Leonard is so great.

297
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,290
<10-26,Penny’s Dad>那我为你开心
<10-26,Penny’s Dad>Well, then I'm happy for you.

298
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,680
<10-27,Penny>谢谢你  爸爸
<10-27,Penny>Aw, thank you, Daddy.

299
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,450
<10-27,Penny>这对我来说太重要了
<10-27,Penny>That means so much.

300
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,640
<10-28,Penny’s Dad>我明白  那些会让人难过的事
<10-28,Penny’s Dad>Well, I understand it's hard to tell someone something

301
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,800
<10-28,Penny’s Dad>是挺难说出口的
<10-28,Penny’s Dad>if you think it's gonna upset 'em.

302
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,730
<10-28,Penny’s Dad>没错
<10-28,Penny’s Dad>It is.

303
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,430
<10-29,Penny>你真是世上最好的爸爸
<10-29,Penny>You're the best dad ever.

304
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,670
<10-30,Penny’s Dad>是啊  先别这么说
<10-30,Penny’s Dad>Yeah. Uh, hold that thought.

305
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,040
<10-30,Penny’s Dad>我也有个小事没告诉你
<10-30,Penny’s Dad>I've been sitting on a little news myself.

306
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,660
<10-31,Penny>什么事
<10-31,Penny>Well, what is it?

307
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,840
<10-32,Penny’s Dad>你知道我为拖拉机配了个旋转式耕耘机吗
<10-32,Penny’s Dad>You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?

308
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,580
<10-33,Penny>不知道
<10-33,Penny>No.

309
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,210
<10-34,Penny’s Dad>你真该来看一看
<10-34,Penny’s Dad>Oh, you should see it.

310
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,980
<10-34,Penny’s Dad>这机器太帅了
<10-34,Penny’s Dad>It is a beautiful piece of machinery.

311
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,300
<10-34,Penny’s Dad>总之...
<10-34,Penny’s Dad>Anyway, uh...

312
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,950
<10-34,Penny’s Dad>我倒车时把你的宠物猪绞进去了
<10-34,Penny’s Dad>I backed over your pet pig with it.

313
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,920
<10-35,Penny>小月舞吗
<10-35,Penny>Moondance?

314
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,560
<10-36,Penny’s Dad>是的  他已经没法跳舞了
<10-36,Penny’s Dad>Yeah, he's, uh, not dancing anymore.

315
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,420
<10-37,Penny>你弄死了我的猪
<10-37,Penny>You killed my pig?

316
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,200
<10-38,Penny’s Dad>不是我干的
<10-38,Penny’s Dad>I did not kill him.

317
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,060
<10-38,Penny’s Dad>是兽医结果了他
<10-38,Penny’s Dad>The vet took care of that.

318
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,330
<10-39,Penny>什么时候的事
<10-39,Penny>When?

319
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,820
<10-40,Penny’s Dad>大概10到12个月之前吧
<10-40,Penny’s Dad>Oh... ten, 12 months ago.

320
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,160
<10-41,Penny>你瞒了一年都不告诉我吗
<10-41,Penny>You didn't tell me for a year?!

321
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,660
<10-42,Penny’s Dad>哈哈  有其父必有其女  对吧
<10-42,Penny’s Dad>Well, apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?

322
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,670
<10-42,Penny’s Dad>爱你  帅妞  挂了
<10-42,Penny’s Dad>Love ya, slugger. Gotta go!

323
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,610
<10-43,Bernadette>好了艾米  该你了
<10-43,Bernadette>Okay, Amy, your turn.

324
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,290
<11-1,Howard>你在干什么
<11-1,Howard>What are you doing?

325
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,970
<11-2,Raj>这叫做拉玛泽呼吸法
<11-2,Raj>It's called Lamaze breathing.

327
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,870
<11-2,Raj>有助于帮你使劲
<11-2,Raj>It helps you push.

328
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,260
<11-2,Raj>太好了
<11-2,Raj>Great.

329
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,370
<11-3,Howard>他在使子宫的劲呢
<11-3,Howard>He's pushing with his uterus.

330
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,500
<11-4,Raj>肯定还有更好的办法来拧
<11-4,Raj>There's got to be a smarter way of removing it.

331
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,960
<11-5,Leonard>对呀  这不过是个简单的物理问题
<11-5,Leonard>Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.

332
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,950
<11-5,Leonard>没错
<11-5,Leonard>Right.

333
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,480
<11-6,Sheldon>阿基米德曾经说
<11-6,Sheldon>Archimedes once said,

334
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,950
<11-6,Sheldon>"给我一根足够长的杠杆
<11-6,Sheldon>"Give me a leever long enough

335
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,480
<11-6,Sheldon>和一个支点
<11-6,Sheldon>and a fulcrum on which to place it,

336
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,500
<11-6,Sheldon>我就能撑起地球"
<11-6,Sheldon>and I shall move the world."

337
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,530
<11-7,Raj>没错
<11-7,Raj>Of course.

338
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,180
<11-7,Raj>我们只需要找到
<11-7,Raj>All we need is to find stuff

339
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,860
<11-7,Raj>一根足够长的杠杆
<11-7,Raj>to make a leever big enough to fix this.

340
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,790
<11-8,Howard>说得对
<11-8,Howard>Exactly.

341
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,290
<11-8,Howard>我想这周围肯定有什么
<11-8,Howard>I'll bet there's something around here

342
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,790
<11-8,Howard>可以用来做杠棍
<11-8,Howard>that could be a lehver.

343
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,230
<11-9,Leonard>我想想  杠棍  杠棍
<11-9,Leonard>Let's see, a lehver, A lehver...

344
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,450
<11-10,Sheldon>等一下
<11-10,Sheldon>Everybody hold on!

345
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,520
<11-10,Sheldon>我们先一步一步地来解决这个问题
<11-10,Sheldon>Let's take this problem one step at a time.

346
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,110
<11-10,Sheldon>首先  我们需要决定
<11-10,Sheldon>First, we need to decide

347
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,380
<11-10,Sheldon>到底是叫杠杆  还是杠棍
<11-10,Sheldon>whether we're calling it leever or lehver.

348
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,140
<11-10,Sheldon>一旦我们确定了叫杠杆
<11-10,Sheldon>And the sooner we decide it's leever,

349
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,850
<11-10,Sheldon>我们就能挽起袖子  而不是舅子
<11-10,Sheldon>the sooner we can roll up our sleeves-- not slehves--

350
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,510
<11-10,Sheldon>开始工作了
<11-10,Sheldon>and get to work.

351
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,490
<11-11,Leonard>我们要"允远"留在这鬼地方了
<11-11,Leonard>We're gonna be here "Foreever."

352
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,990
<12-1,Penny>我谢谢你们全家啊
<12-1,Penny>Thanks a lot, guys.

353
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,900
<12-2,Bernadette>关我们什么事
<12-2,Bernadette>What did we do?

354
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,980
<12-3,Penny>在我打那通电话之前
<12-3,Penny>Before I made that call,

355
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,400
<12-3,Penny>我的猪猪还活着
<12-3,Penny>my pig was alive and happy

356
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,150
<12-3,Penny>欢快地在泥巴里打滚
<12-3,Penny>and rolling around in the mud.

357
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,060
<12-3,Penny>现在他被非法葬在我们家后院
<12-3,Penny>Now he's illegally buried in our backyard

358
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,280
<12-3,Penny>紧挨着我太奶奶
<12-3,Penny>next to my great-grandmother.

359
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,430
<12-4,Bernadette>真的吗  没有被吃掉
<12-4,Bernadette>Really? They didn't eat him?

360
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,680
<12-4,Bernadette>没有
<12-4,Bernadette>No.

361
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,420
<12-5,Penny>他是我们挚爱的家族成员
<12-5,Penny>He was a beloved member of the family.

362
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,010
<12-6,Bernadette>早餐肉中的成员吗
<12-6,Bernadette>The breakfast meat family?

363
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,520
<12-7,Penny>这不好笑
<12-7,Penny>It's not funny.

364
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,210
<12-7,Penny>该你了  给你妈打电话
<12-7,Penny>You're up. Call your mother.

365
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,430
<12-8,Amy>还是等会吧
<12-8,Amy>Oh, maybe later.

366
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,510
<12-8,Amy>猪猪不幸逝世  让我深感悲痛
<12-8,Amy>Your pig dying made me sad.

367
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,370
<12-8,Amy>还有点饿
<12-8,Amy>And a little hungry.

368
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,740
<12-9,Penny>马上打电话
<12-9,Penny>Phone, now.

369
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,610
<12-10,Amy>知道了  好了
<12-10,Amy>Okay. Okay.

370
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,530
<12-10,Amy>好吧
<12-10,Amy>Fine.

371
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,160
<12-10,Amy>喂  妈妈啊
<12-10,Amy>Hi, Mom.

372
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,080
<12-11,Penny>你倒是拨号啊
<12-11,Penny>Try dialing.

373
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,050
<12-12,Amy>被你看穿了呀
<12-12,Amy>You saw that, huh?

374
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,930
<12-12,Amy>妈妈  你好吗
<12-12,Amy>Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

375
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,330
<12-12,Amy>我也好
<12-12,Amy>Oh, good.

376
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,790
<12-11,Penny>工作怎么样
<12-11,Penny>How's work?

377
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,910
<12-11,Penny>挺好的
<12-11,Penny>That's nice.

378
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,740
<12-10,Amy>我很好
<12-10,Amy>I'm fine.

379
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,050
<12-12,Amy>听着  我一直想问
<12-12,Amy>Hey, listen, I've been meaning to ask,

380
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,550
<12-12,Amy>多姨和弗洛伦斯姨怎么一直处不来呢
<12-12,Amy>how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?

381
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,010
<12-13,Penny>给我吧
<12-13,Penny>Okay, just... give me that.

382
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,160
<12-13,Penny>艾米跟谢尔顿分手了
<12-13,Penny>Amy broke up with Sheldon,

383
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,900
<12-13,Penny>她打了耳洞
<12-13,Penny>she got her ears pierced

384
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,740
<12-13,Penny>还非逼我们吃大屌饼干
<12-13,Penny>and she made us eat penis cookies!

385
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,110
<12-13,Penny>等等
<12-13,Penny>Hang on.

386
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,450
<12-13,Penny>她想跟你谈谈
<12-13,Penny>She wants to talk to you.

387
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,620
<13-1,Leonard>我感觉杠杆没起作用
<13-1,Leonard>I don't think the lever's working.

388
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,180
<13-2,Howard>你凭啥那么说
<13-2,Howard>What makes you say that?

389
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,130
<13-3,Leonard>肯定有别的方法可以试试
<13-3,Leonard>There's gotta be something else we can try.

390
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,320
<13-4,Raj>这要是在《星际迷航》里
<13-4,Raj>If this was Star Trek,

391
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,710
<13-4,Raj>我们可以用相位枪把它炸开
<13-4,Raj>we could use a phaser to blast it off.

392
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,730
<13-5,Howard>不行  激光束太粗了
<13-5,Howard>No, it's too broad of a beam.

393
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,140
<13-5,Howard>要更精准的
<13-5,Howard>You'd need something more precise,

394
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,870
<13-5,Howard>比如超人的热视线
<13-5,Howard>like Superman's heat vision.

395
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,420
<13-6,Sheldon>或者绿灯侠的能量戒指
<13-6,Sheldon>Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring

396
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,150
<13-6,Sheldon>可以变成大绿手  来拧松它
<13-6,Sheldon>could make a big green hand that unscrews it.

397
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,190
<13-7,Raj>如果要大绿手
<13-7,Raj>If you need a green hand,

398
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,490
<13-7,Raj>何不直接找绿巨人
<13-7,Raj>why not just use the Hulk?

399
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,360
<13-8,Sheldon>得了吧
<13-8,Sheldon>Oh, please,

400
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,970
<13-8,Sheldon>绿巨人那个脾气哪过得了边防
<13-8,Sheldon>the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.

401
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,270
<13-9,Leonard>大伙  插一句
<13-9,Leonard>Guys, excuse me,

402
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,790
<13-9,Leonard>不是说呼叫复仇者联盟的人来
<13-9,Leonard>not that calling one of the Avengers

403
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,580
<13-9,Leonard>不是完美合理的解决方法
<13-9,Leonard>isn't a perfectly reasonable choice,

404
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,650
<13-9,Leonard>可我们是科学家
<13-9,Leonard>but we're scientists.

405
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,670
<13-9,Leonard>不应该用真正的科学去解决吗
<13-9,Leonard>Don't you think we can figure this out using actual science?

406
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,200
<13-10,Sheldon>是的  我们可以运用真正的科学
<13-10,Sheldon>Yes, we could use science.

407
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,530
<13-10,Sheldon>但这是你的单身派对
<13-10,Sheldon>But it's your bachelor party.

408
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,100
<13-11,Caption>高兴点
<13-11,Caption>Lighten up.

409
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,090

<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>* 伙计  你是个小孩 *
<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>* Buddy you're a boy *

415
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,250

<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>* Gonna be a big man someday *

417
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,660

<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>* Kickin' your can all over the place. *

419
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,000
<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>我过目不忘的记忆
<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>I have an eidetic memory.

420
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,780
<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>有时是诅咒般的存在
<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>Sometimes it's a curse.

421
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,960
<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>科学原理
<13-14,Sheldon (singing)>热膨胀

422
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,380
<13-16,Raj>我没想到
<13-16,Raj>I had no idea

423
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,400
<13-16,Raj>墨西哥炸玉米片居然是个好燃料
<13-16,Raj>tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.

424
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,530
<13-17,Leonard>基本就是沾满油的纯碳氢化合物
<13-17,Leonard>They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat.

425
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,960
<13-17,Leonard>希望轮爪螺母可以膨胀
<13-17,Leonard>Let's hope the lug nut expands.

426
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,370
<13-18,Sheldon>烧食物的香味引来动物怎么办
<13-18,Sheldon>What if that burning food attracts animals?

427
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,660
<13-19,Howard>我们有很多食物可以给动物吃
<13-19,Howard>We have plenty of food for the animals.

428
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,840
<13-20,Sheldon>-有吗  -当然
<13-20,Sheldon>- We do? - Yep.

429
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,760
<13-21,Howard>闪电侠T恤裹着的六尺长香肠
<13-21,Howard>A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.

430
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,840
<13-22,Sheldon>一点都不友好
<13-22,Sheldon>That's not very nice.

431
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,050
<13-23,Leonard>这是单身派对   高兴点
<13-23,Leonard>It's a bachelor party. Lighten up.

432
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,080
<13-23,Leonard>科学原理
<13-23,Leonard>加速腐蚀

434
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,770
<13-25,Sheldon>这难闻的味道是什么
<13-25,Sheldon>What is that awful smell?

435
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,270
<13-26,Howard>烧着的莎莎酱
<13-26,Howard>It's burning salsa.

436
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,570
<13-26,Howard>希望酸性和盐度与电结合
<13-26,Howard>I'm hoping the acidity and salinity

437
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,340
<13-26,Howard>可以腐蚀部分螺母
<13-26,Howard>combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.

438
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,550
<13-27,Sheldon>多有创意的方法
<13-27,Sheldon>What an innovative solution.

439
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,060
<13-27,Sheldon>之前瞧不起你的麻省理工学院学历是我不好
<13-27,Sheldon>Perhaps I don't give your MIT education enough credit.

440
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,800
<13-28,Howard>我是在谣言终结者上学到的
<13-28,Howard>Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.

441
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,430
<13-28,Howard>科学原理
<13-28,Howard>放热反应

442
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,360
<13-30,Sheldon>好了  这些锈
<13-30,Sheldon>All right, this rust,

443
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,010
<13-30,Sheldon>与面包车弄下来的铝
<13-30,Sheldon>combined with the aluminum recovered from the van,

444
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,360
<13-30,Sheldon>就是铝热剂了
<13-30,Sheldon>is now thermite.

445
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,120
<13-30,Sheldon>很好
<13-30,Sheldon>Great.

446
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,890
<13-31,Howard>来几小撮就够了
<13-31,Howard>Couple pinches ought to do the trick.

447
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,830
<13-32,Raj>这些够融掉螺母吗
<13-32,Raj>Is that enough to melt the lug nut?

448
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,770
<13-33,Leonard>一点点来
<13-33,Leonard>Well, let's start small.

449
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,180
<13-33,Leonard>可以再加的
<13-33,Leonard>We can always add more.

450
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,440
<13-34,Howard>螺母  你确实骁勇善战
<13-34,Howard>You put up a good fight, lug nut,

451
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,540
<13-34,Howard>可惜你遇到对手了[火柴]
<13-34,Howard>but you've met your match.

452
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,730
<14-1,Raj>瞧
<14-1,Raj>Hey, look!

453
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,800
<14-1,Raj>螺母掉了
<14-1,Raj>The lug nut's off.

454
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,530
<14-1,Raj>你们怎么回来了
<14-1,Raj>What are you doing back?

455
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,410
<15-1,Penny>爆胎了
<15-1,Penny>We got a flat

456
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,990
<15-2,Leonard>轮胎换不下来
<15-2,Leonard>and couldn't get the tire off.

457
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,790
<15-3,Penny>好遗憾
<15-3,Penny>Oh, I'm sorry.

458
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,800
<15-4,Leonard>谢谢你
<15-4,Leonard>Thank you.

459
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,270
<15-5,Penny>不知道会不会让你们平衡一些
<15-5,Penny>If it makes you feel any better,

460
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,530
<15-5,Penny>我给艾米穿了耳洞
<15-5,Penny>I pierced Amy's ears

461
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,460
<15-5,Penny>她妈妈罚她坐我衣柜里呢
<15-5,Penny>and her mom made her sit in my closet.

462
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,760
<15-6,Sheldon>我们把费曼先生的面包车烧了
<15-6,Sheldon>We blew up Feynman's van.

463
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,440
<15-7,Penny>我爸用拖拉机把我的猪猪杀了
<15-7,Penny>My dad killed my pig with his tractor.

464
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,580
<15-8,Leonard>我跟谢尔顿在墨西哥共度了一夜
<15-8,Leonard>I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.

465
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,940
<15-9,Penny>你赢了
<15-9,Penny>You win.
