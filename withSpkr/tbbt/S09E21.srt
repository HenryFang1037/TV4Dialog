1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,360
<14-3,Sheldon>我有个跟蝙蝠人有关的问题
<14-3,Sheldon>I have a question about Batman.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,240
<1-1,Sheldon>蝙蝠人是个穿得像蝙蝠的人
<1-1,Sheldon>Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,810
<1-1,Sheldon>人蝠是半人半蝙蝠的混种生物
<1-1,Sheldon>Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,920
<1-1,Sheldon>如果人蝠打扮成人去打击犯罪
<1-1,Sheldon>Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,200
<1-1,Sheldon>那他会变成人蝙蝠人吗
<1-1,Sheldon>would he be Man-Batman?

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,820
<1-2,Leonard>不会  他会变蝙蝠人蝠
<1-2,Leonard>No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,290
<1-3,Raj>但是人蝙蝠人不应该是蝙蝠人
<1-3,Raj>But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,420
<1-3,Raj>如蜘蛛人就是被放射性蜘蛛咬过后
<1-3,Raj>才获得类似蜘蛛般的能力

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,420
<1-3,Raj>被放射性人类咬过之后的样子吗
<1-3,Raj>that was bitten by a radioactive man?

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,500
<1-4,Howard>但蝙蝠人本来就是人啊
<1-4,Howard>But Batman is a man.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,550
<1-4,Howard>你刚才说人被赋予人的能力
<1-4,Howard>You're talking about a man who would have the powers of a man.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,990
<1-5,Sheldon>就像是人类吃了人人果实
<1-5,Sheldon>That's just Man-Man.

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,650
<1-5,Sheldon>但人人其实不就是人而已吗
<1-5,Sheldon>Well, isn't Man-Man just man?

16
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,420
<1-6,Leonard>但要是人人穿成像蝙蝠呢
<1-6,Leonard>But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,420
<1-7,Raj>那就是蝙蝠人啊
<1-7,Raj>Well, that's just Batman.

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,490
<1-8,Leonard>不对  一个人穿上蝙蝠装
<1-8,Leonard>No, if a man dresses as a bat,

19
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,460
<1-8,Leonard>那是蝙蝠人  但如果是人人穿上蝙蝠装
<1-8,Leonard>that's Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat,

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,570
<1-8,Leonard>那就是蝙蝠人人
<1-8,Leonard>that's Batman-Man.

21
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,070
<1-9,Howard>这样算回答了你的问题吗
<1-9,Howard>So does that answer your question?

22
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,720
<1-10,Sheldon>我还没问我的问题呢
<1-10,Sheldon>Oh, I haven't asked it yet.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,990
<1-11,Raj (checking text on phone)>是克莱尔  我得先走了
<1-11,Raj (checking text on phone)>Oh, that's Claire. Got to run.

24
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,550
<1-12,Leonard>我还以为你跟艾米丽复合了呢
<1-12,Leonard>I thought you were back with Emily.

25
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,840
<1-13,Raj>其实我...  同时在跟她们交往[看]
<1-13,Raj>Uh, actually I'm... seeing both of them.

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,280
<1-14,Leonard>你是指躲在她们窗外草丛偷看的"看"吗
<1-14,Leonard>You mean like through their window from behind a bush?

27
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,420
<1-15,Raj>不是  我是指同时跟两个女生交往
<1-15,Raj>No, I'm actually dating two women.

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,860
<1-15,Raj>回头见
<1-15,Raj>Later.

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,540
<1-15,Raj>不是吧
<1-15,Raj>Really?

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,250
<1-16,Leonard>这多少年来不敢跟女人说话的人
<1-16,Leonard>The guy who for years couldn't even talk to women

31
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,900
<1-16,Leonard>居然突然就开始脚踏两条船
<1-16,Leonard>is suddenly going out with two of them?

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,520
<1-16,Leonard>-这怎么可能  -对啊
<1-16,Leonard>- How is that possible? - I know.

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,380
<1-17,Howard>科学家一直试图用计算模型模拟这件事
<1-17,Howard>Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models,

34
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,320
<1-17,Howard>但所有尝试中  最后世界都会爆炸
<1-17,Howard>but, in each case, the world blows up.

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,980
<1-18,Leonard>说真的  这家伙居然能享齐人之福
<1-18,Leonard>Seriously, that guy's dating two women?

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,750
<1-18,Leonard>翻译：穿着赛太公衣服被放射赛太公咬的赛
<1-18,Leonard>YY  猫中之王  别扭大菜

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,030
<2-1,Sheldon>你为什么买了一个派对潜艇堡
<2-1,Sheldon>What, why did you get a party sub?

47
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,160
<2-2,Leonard>大家要来玩  这样感觉有意思啊
<2-2,Leonard>People are coming over; it looked fun.

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,130
<2-3,Sheldon>我们只是要一起看《权力的游戏》
<2-3,Sheldon>Well, we're only watching Game of Thrones.

49
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,040
<2-3,Sheldon>但派对潜艇堡意味着会有派对
<2-3,Sheldon>A party sub implies it's a party.

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,970
<2-4,Leonard>但你会出席已意味着不会有派对
<2-4,Leonard>Your attendance implies it's not.

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,940
<2-5,Sheldon>我喜欢派对的程度与一个普通人无异
<2-5,Sheldon>I like a party as much as the next man,

52
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,580
<2-5,Sheldon>前提是这普通人并不喜欢派对
<2-5,Sheldon>as long as the next man doesn't like a party.

53
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,490
<2-5,Sheldon>对了  你别忘了
<2-5,Sheldon>Oh, by the way, don't forget,

54
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,010
<2-5,Sheldon>明天是我们的室友协议季度大会
<2-5,Sheldon>tomorrow is our quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.

55
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,390
<2-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  我们不需要每三个月就开一次会吧
<2-6,Leonard>Oh, Sheldon, we don't need a meeting every three months.

56
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,220
<2-7,Sheldon>你这个提议感觉就很值得
<2-7,Sheldon>Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up

57
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,640
<2-7,Sheldon>在明天的季度大会上提出呢
<2-7,Sheldon>at a quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.

58
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,410
<2-7,Sheldon>你真走运  会议刚好在明天
<2-7,Sheldon>Lucky for you it's tomorrow.

59
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,600
<2-8,Leonard>我告诉你  我是不会参加的
<2-8,Leonard>Oh, you know what? I'm not going.

60
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,790
<2-9,Sheldon>你必须得参加
<2-9,Sheldon>Well, you have to go.

61
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,270
<2-9,Sheldon>明天是佩妮首次主持效忠宣誓呢
<2-9,Sheldon>It's Penny's first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.

62
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,220
<2-10,Leonard>这个会议根本就是浪费时间
<2-10,Leonard>This meeting is a waste of time.

63
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,190
<2-10,Leonard>比如决定要不要
<2-10,Leonard>Whether we make the switch

64
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,340
<2-10,Leonard>从早餐谷物产品A换到产品B这种事
<2-10,Leonard>from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran

65
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,360
<2-10,Leonard>不需要经过议会程序来定好吗
<2-10,Leonard>should not require parliamentary procedure.

66
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,020
<2-11,Sheldon>你知道其中一款里的葡萄干上有糖吧
<2-11,Sheldon>You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.

67
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,920
<2-12,Leonard>反正都是你一个人吃啊
<2-12,Leonard>You're the only one who eats them!

68
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,660
<2-13,Sheldon>而你居然有幸能提出意见呢
<2-13,Sheldon>And yet you get to weigh in.

69
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,240
<2-13,Sheldon>民主  就是这么酷  对吧
<2-13,Sheldon>Democracy-- it's pretty cool, isn't it?

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,220
<2-14,Leonard>我不参加  你也逼不了我
<2-14,Leonard>I'm not going; you can't make me.

71
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,200
<2-15,Sheldon>那我们就走着瞧
<2-15,Sheldon>Well, we'll just see about that.

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,330
<2-16,Penny>怎么啦怎么啦
<2-16,Penny>What is the problem?

73
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,810
<2-17,Sheldon>他说明天不来参加室友协议季度大会
<2-17,Sheldon>He says he's not coming to the Roommate Agreement meeting tomorrow.

74
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,360
<2-18,Penny>那我不是白背了效忠宣誓词吗
<2-18,Penny>Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?

75
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,440
<2-19,Leonard>祝玩得愉快  我反正不参加
<2-19,Leonard>You have fun. I will not be attending.

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,730
<2-20,Sheldon>行啊  你要是不想参加
<2-20,Sheldon>Oh, fine. We don't have to have

77
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,480
<2-20,Sheldon>我们以后可以不办室友协议季度大会啊
<2-20,Sheldon>a Roommate Agreement meeting if you don't want to.

78
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,580
<2-21,Leonard>-谢谢  -但这件事需要经过投票表决
<2-21,Leonard>- Thank you. - Of course, it will require a vote.

79
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,360
<2-22,Sheldon>遗憾的是  我的正式木槌放在房间里
<2-22,Sheldon>Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom,

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,310
<2-22,Sheldon>但好在我的旅游随身木槌在这
<2-22,Sheldon>but luckily, I have my travel gavel.

81
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,240
<2-23,Leonard>你是在耍白痴
<2-23,Leonard>You're being ridiculous.

82
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,310
<2-24,Sheldon>有一个动议"谢尔顿是在耍白痴"
<2-24,Sheldon>There's a motion on the floor, "I'm ridiculous."

83
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,790
<2-24,Sheldon>有人附议吗
<2-24,Sheldon>Do we have a second?

84
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,700
<2-24,Sheldon>无人附议
<2-24,Sheldon>There is no second.

85
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,670
<2-24,Sheldon>动议驳回
<2-24,Sheldon>The motion is denied.

86
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,160
<2-24,Sheldon>下次请确保有人会投票
<2-24,Sheldon>Next time, make sure you have the votes first.

87
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,710
<2-24,Sheldon>刚才也太丢人了
<2-24,Sheldon>That was embarrassing.

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,890
<2-25,Leonard>你能跟他说说吗
<2-25,Leonard>Can you please talk to him?

89
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,260
<2-26,Penny>你为什么要跟他争这事啊
<2-26,Penny>Well, why are you fighting him on this?

90
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,140
<2-27,Leonard>因为我受够了什么事都得顺他意
<2-27,Leonard>Because I am tired of him always getting his way.

91
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,260
<2-27,Leonard>我们又不需要这傻逼大会
<2-27,Leonard>We don't need a stupid meeting.

92
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,700
<2-27,Leonard>我们甚至都不需要狗屁《室友协议》
<2-27,Leonard>We don't even need a Roommate Agreement,

93
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,430
<2-27,Leonard>而且我还真希望这潜艇堡能招来派对呢
<2-27,Leonard>and I hope that sandwich does cause a party!

94
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,650
<2-28,Penny>我还是会来参加你的大会
<2-28,Penny>Well, I will still come to your meeting.

95
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,550
<2-29,Sheldon>希望如此啊  明天可是拍照日
<2-29,Sheldon>Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow's picture day.

96
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,490
<2-30,Leonard>你为什么站他那边啊
<2-30,Leonard>Why are you taking his side?

97
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,640
<2-31,Penny>因为这事对他很重要
<2-31,Penny>Because it's important to him,

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,980
<2-31,Penny>我们签署《室友协议》时  就同意了这事啊
<2-31,Penny>and when we signed the Roommate Agreement, we made a deal.

99
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,160
<2-32,Sheldon>你再这么讲话  很快就要荣升扛旗者了
<2-32,Sheldon>Y-You keep talking like that, you're gonna make color guard.

100
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,190
<3-1,Raj>-天啊  我真是心力交瘁  -对啊
<3-1,Raj>- Man, I'm worn out. - I know.

101
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,360
<3-2,Howard>想象一下如果真像游戏里那么跑动
<3-2,Howard>Imagine if we were actually moving.

102
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,610
<3-3,Raj>不是啦  我是说自从我开始
<3-3,Raj>No, it's just, ever since I started dating

103
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,110
<3-3,Raj>跟克莱尔和艾米丽同时交往  真是精疲力尽啊
<3-3,Raj>Claire and Emily at the same time, it's exhausting.

104
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,430
<3-4,Howard>你这就精疲力尽啦
<3-4,Howard>You're exhausted?

105
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,750
<3-4,Howard>等你试过孕妇书里每五页就折个角
<3-4,Howard>Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book

106
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,990
<3-4,Howard>好让你老婆觉得你有读  你才知道累
<3-4,Howard>so your wife thinks you read it.

107
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,970
<3-5,Raj>但兄弟  你很幸运了
<3-5,Raj>But, dude, you're so lucky.

108
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,150
<3-5,Raj>每晚能在家与你相爱的女人共度
<3-5,Raj>Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.

109
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,780
<3-6,Howard>我的确很幸运
<3-6,Howard>I guess I am lucky.

110
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,960
<3-6,Howard>没错  如果你同时和两个女人约会
<3-6,Howard>You are, because dating two women,

111
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,910
<3-7,Raj>我是说  我都不记得
<3-7,Raj>I mean, I can't even remember

112
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,700
<3-7,Raj>上一次我睡在自己家是何年何月了
<3-7,Raj>the last time I slept in my own apartment.

113
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,440
<3-7,Raj>我每天醒来就想  "这是克莱尔还是艾米丽家
<3-7,Raj>I wake up and I'm like, "Am I at Claire's or am I at Emily's?

114
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,330
<3-7,Raj>还是某个我想不起芳名的新妞家"
<3-7,Raj>Is there a third girl I've forgotten about?"

115
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,170
<3-7,Raj>就像是
<3-7,Raj>Like...

116
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,110
<3-7,Raj>"我在谁家香闺啊"
<3-7,Raj>"Where am I?"

117
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,950
<3-8,Bernadette>拉杰
<3-8,Bernadette>Hey, Raj.

118
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,750
<3-9,Raj>准妈咪  你还好吗
<3-9,Raj>Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?

119
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,150
<3-10,Bernadette>还好  有点小累
<3-10,Bernadette>Good. A little tired.

120
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,100
<3-11,Raj>我感同身受  我最近和好几个妹子约会来着
<3-11,Raj>I feel you. I've been dating multiple women.

121
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,640
<3-12,Howard>你确定不跟我们一起看《权力的游戏》吗
<3-12,Howard>You sure you don't want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?

122
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
<3-13,Bernadette>你们自己慢慢看
<3-13,Bernadette>You guys have fun.

123
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,830
<3-13,Bernadette>我去床上窝着看书就好
<3-13,Bernadette>I'm just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.

124
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,930
<3-14,Raj>听起来好爽啊  一个人独占一张床
<3-14,Raj>Oh, that sounds great-- a bed to yourself.

125
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,460
<3-14,Raj>我都想不起那种感觉是什么样了
<3-14,Raj>Can't even remember what that's like.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,090
<4-1,Sheldon>你熟悉最新的《权力的游戏》剧情吗
<4-1,Sheldon>Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?

127
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,550
<4-2,Penny>应该是吧
<4-2,Penny>Mm, I think so.

128
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,650
<4-2,Penny>龙呀  雪僵尸啊
<4-2,Penny>Dragons, snow zombies,

129
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,760
<4-2,Penny>还有凡是长得帅的家伙都死了
<4-2,Penny>and all the hot guys are dead.

130
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,280
<4-2,Penny>这我可不确定了
<4-2,Penny>Oh, I don't know.

131
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,000
<4-3,Sheldon>席恩·葛雷乔伊的长相
<4-3,Sheldon>Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,790
<4-3,Sheldon>对于没了小弟弟的人来说  相当不错了
<4-3,Sheldon>for a guy who had his genitals cut off.

133
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,450
<4-4,Penny>哎哟喂  有人还在闹小情绪呢
<4-4,Penny>Uh-oh, somebody's still pouting.

134
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,430
<4-5,Leonard>别管我
<4-5,Leonard>Leave me alone.

135
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,940
<4-6,Penny>如果是因为掉了一根"小棒子"
<4-6,Penny>If it's because you lost a stick,

136
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,410
<4-6,Penny>我知道它在哪里
<4-6,Penny>I know where it went.

137
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,160
<4-7,Leonard>一点也不好笑
<4-7,Leonard>Not funny.

138
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,080
<4-8,Penny>明知道会和好
<4-8,Penny>You know you're gonna make up with him.

139
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,290
<4-8,Penny>就不能直接跳到握手言和的那刻吗
<4-8,Penny>Can we just skip to that part?

140
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,050
<4-9,Leonard>对  因为我是这里唯一一个成熟的人
<4-9,Leonard>Oh, of course, because I'm the only adult around here.

141
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,520
<4-10,Penny>真的吗  唯一成熟的人
<4-10,Penny>Really? The only adult?

142
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,180
<4-11,Leonard>没错
<4-11,Leonard>Yeah, that's right.

143
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,450
<4-12,Sheldon>今晚我要看的节目可是标识为M.A.的
<4-12,Sheldon>Tonight I'll be watching a show rated M.A.,

144
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,440
<4-12,Sheldon>意思是成年观众  你个小屁孩
<4-12,Sheldon>and that stands for "Mature Audiences," buster.

145
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,180
<4-13,Penny>"唯一成熟的人"可不会因为
<4-13,Penny>All right, you would think "the only adult"

146
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,330
<4-13,Penny>一些蠢事而破坏别人整晚的情绪
<4-13,Penny>wouldn't let something silly ruin our entire night.

147
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,940
<4-14,Leonard>我还以为你会理解我不爽的原因呢
<4-14,Leonard>And I'd think you'd understand why I'm annoyed.

148
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,490
<4-15,Sheldon>只要你来参加大会  不就没这些事了吗
<4-15,Sheldon>All this could be avoided if you'd just come to the meeting.

149
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,830
<4-16,Leonard>人家不想参加
<4-16,Leonard>I don't want to.

150
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,140
<4-17,Sheldon>只是一个大会而已
<4-17,Sheldon>Oh, it's just a meeting.

151
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,100
<4-18,Leonard>-一个简单的大会  -不要再提大会两个字了
<4-18,Leonard>- One simple meeting. - Stop saying "meeting"!

152
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,370
<4-19,Sheldon>* 大会  大会  三四五六七 *
<4-19,Sheldon>* Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting *

153
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,810
<4-19,Sheldon>* 你不想听  我却偏要提 *
<4-19,Sheldon>* Banana-fana, fo-feeting *

154
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,200
<4-19,Sheldon>* 大灰  打毁  答慧 *
<4-19,Sheldon>* Fee-fi mo-meeting... *

155
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,820
<4-20,Amy>我带来了我的招牌菠菜蘸酱
<4-20,Amy>I brought my famous spinach dip.

156
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,970
<4-21,Sheldon>艾米  等一下
<4-21,Sheldon>Yo, Amy, just one second.

157
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,230
<4-21,Sheldon>* 大会 *
<4-21,Sheldon>* Meeting. *

158
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,010
<5-1,Howard>我不知道自己想要个儿子还是女儿
<5-1,Howard>I'm not sure if I'm hoping for a boy or a girl.

159
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,530
<5-1,Howard>如果生的是儿子
<5-1,Howard>I mean, if it's a boy,

160
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,760
<5-1,Howard>我就得教他玩接投球
<5-1,Howard>I'm gonna have to teach him to play catch.

161
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,350
<5-1,Howard>那我就得上网去查怎么玩接投球
<5-1,Howard>Which means I'm gonna have to Google "How to play catch."

162
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,830
<5-1,Howard>如果生的是女儿
<5-1,Howard>If it's a girl, I mean...

163
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,050
<5-1,Howard>她们那么天真无邪
<5-1,Howard>they're so innocent and...

164
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,600
<5-1,Howard>而你知道男人都是什么鬼样子
<5-1,Howard>you know how guys are.

165
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,720
<5-2,Raj>真的  男人都不是好东西
<5-2,Raj>Totally, guys are the worst.

166
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,220
<5-2,Raj>看看我
<5-2,Raj>I mean, look at me.

167
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,840
<5-2,Raj>我让艾米丽给我做了意大利烘蛋
<5-2,Raj>I let Emily make me a frittata

168
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,000
<5-2,Raj>然后把吃剩的留在克莱尔的冰箱里
<5-2,Raj>and I kept the leftovers in Claire's fridge that night.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,300
<5-2,Raj>我真是个渣男
<5-2,Raj>I'm such a dog.

170
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,600
<5-3,Howard>你又来了
<5-3,Howard>There you go again.

171
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,860
<5-4,Raj>抱歉  我是不是抱怨得太多了
<5-4,Raj>I'm sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?

172
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,840
<5-5,Howard>其实你现在是在假抱怨
<5-5,Howard>Actually, what you're doing is pretending to complain,

173
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,240
<5-5,Howard>真显摆
<5-5,Howard>but really trying to brag.

174
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,550
<5-6,Raj>你怎么能这么说
<5-6,Raj>How could you say that?

175
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,990
<5-7,Howard>"人家真希望可以安静喝完一杯茶
<5-7,Howard>"Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea

176
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,440
<5-7,Howard>而没有裸女在我身上跳来跳去"
<5-7,Howard>without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."

177
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,610
<5-8,Raj>我从未说过这话
<5-8,Raj>I never said that.

178
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,630
<5-9,Howard>"人家记不得掉在沙发里的胸罩到底是谁的
<5-9,Howard>"Don't you hate it when you can't remember whose bra it is

179
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,470
<5-9,Howard>真是好讨厌哦"
<5-9,Howard>you found wedged in your couch?"

180
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,820
<5-10,Raj>好吧  这话我说过
<5-10,Raj>Okay, that I said.

181
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,350
<5-10,Raj>但这是真实的问题啊
<5-10,Raj>But that's a real problem!

182
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,130
<5-10,Raj>你把一个妹子的胸罩给了另一妹子
<5-10,Raj>You give a girl another woman's bra,

183
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,440
<5-10,Raj>你那晚上就别想和那妹子滚床单了
<5-10,Raj>and you will not be having sex with her that night.

184
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,690
<5-10,Raj>也许还能和另一个妹子睡  但这妹子绝对没戏
<5-10,Raj>Maybe the other girl, but not her.

185
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,410
<6-1,Amy>他怎么了
<6-1,Amy>What's going on with him?

186
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,750
<6-2,Penny>他为了参不参加
<6-2,Penny>Oh, he's all bent out of shape

187
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,920
<6-2,Penny>室友协议大会而闹别扭呢
<6-2,Penny>about having a Roommate Agreement meeting.

188
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,340
<6-3,Sheldon>这年头完美出勤率貌似不够酷炫了
<6-3,Sheldon>Apparently, perfect attendance isn't cool anymore.

189
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,950
<6-4,Penny>别担心  他会想明白的
<6-4,Penny>Don't worry, he'll come around.

190
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,950
<6-5,Amy>我能理解他为什么不高兴
<6-5,Amy>Well, I get why he's annoyed.

191
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,830
<6-6,Sheldon>那是你不明白到底是怎么回事
<6-6,Sheldon>Well, then you don't understand what's happening.

192
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,900
<6-6,Sheldon>你看
<6-6,Sheldon>See...

193
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,760
<6-6,Sheldon>莱纳德拒绝出席
<6-6,Sheldon>Leonard refused to participate

194
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,540
<6-6,Sheldon>一个强制性的室友协议季度大会
<6-6,Sheldon>in a mandatory quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.

195
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,130
<6-6,Sheldon>这就是以巴特·辛普森为榜样养育下一代的恶果
<6-6,Sheldon>This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.

197
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,220
<6-7,Leonard>你明明自己也爱看《辛普森一家》
<6-7,Leonard>You love The Simpsons.

198
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,920
<6-8,Sheldon>人家喜欢的是丽莎·辛普森
<6-8,Sheldon>I love Lisa Simpson.

200
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,340
<6-9,Amy>我能理解他的感受
<6-9,Amy>Well, I know how he feels.

201
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,040
<6-9,Amy>我就不喜欢咱俩的恋爱协议大会
<6-9,Amy>I never enjoyed our Relationship Agreement meetings.

202
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,270
<6-10,Sheldon>等等
<6-10,Sheldon>Wait.

203
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,280
<6-10,Sheldon>你之前都是假装的吗
<6-10,Sheldon>You were pretending?

204
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,030
<6-11,Amy>抱歉
<6-11,Amy>Sorry.

205
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,460
<6-11,Amy>不可能
<6-11,Amy>No!

206
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,380
<6-12,Sheldon>我不相信  我能分清真假
<6-12,Sheldon>I don't believe you. I could tell.

207
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,850
<6-12,Sheldon>"哇  谢尔顿
<6-12,Sheldon>"Oh, Sheldon,

208
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,940
<6-13,Amy>我从未想过在常务委员会里
<6-13,Amy>I never thought re-filing a matter

209
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,330
<6-13,Amy>重审一个议题会如此让人目眩神迷"
<6-13,Amy>in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating."

210
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,460
<6-14,Sheldon>你觉得这是真是假
<6-14,Sheldon>Hmm, what do you think?

211
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,150
<6-15,Penny>你分不清吗
<6-15,Penny>You don't know?

212
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,230
<7-1,Raj>我是不是说了什么惹你不高兴了
<7-1,Raj>Hey, did I say something to upset you?

213
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,630
<7-2,Howard>没有  我没事
<7-2,Howard>No, I'm fine.

214
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,820
<7-3,Raj>是吗  因为通常我们都肩并肩一起上楼
<7-3,Raj>Really? Because usually we walk side by side,

215
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,570
<7-3,Raj>而今天我爬了两层楼梯
<7-3,Raj>and I just went up two flights of stairs

216
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,950
<7-3,Raj>都是跟在后面盯着你的屁股
<7-3,Raj>staring at your bottom.

217
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,560
<7-4,Howard>消停会儿吧
<7-4,Howard>Just drop it.

218
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,990
<7-5,Raj>好吧  我知道是怎么回事了
<7-5,Raj>Okay, I think I see what's happening here.

219
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,270
<7-5,Raj>你嫉妒我
<7-5,Raj>You're jealous of me.

220
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,390
<7-6,Howard>拜托
<7-6,Howard>Oh, please.

221
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,840
<7-6,Howard>你有什么好让我嫉妒的
<7-6,Howard>What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?

222
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,950
<7-7,Raj>不是我有什么
<7-7,Raj>It's not what I have,

223
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,960
<7-7,Raj>而是我跟多少人一起"分享"
<7-7,Raj>it's how many people I'm having it with.

224
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,040
<7-8,Penny>走吧  谢尔顿  我们去对面看
<7-8,Penny>Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch Game of Thrones over here.

225
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,730
<7-9,Sheldon>乐意之极
<7-9,Sheldon>Gladly.

226
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,550
<7-10,Leonard>好啊  走吧  我高兴还来不及呢
<7-10,Leonard>Oh, good, go. You know, it'll be nice to

227
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,070
<7-10,Leonard>终于看剧的时候没人在旁边说
<7-10,Leonard>watch an episode without someone saying,

228
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,150
<7-10,Leonard>"我看过原著
<7-10,Leonard>"I read the books.

229
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,560
<7-10,Leonard>别太喜欢上这个角色"
<7-10,Leonard>Don't get too fond of this character."

230
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,180
<7-11,Sheldon>不全是因为他们会死啊
<7-11,Sheldon>It's not always because they die.

231
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,000
<7-11,Sheldon>举个例子  某角色是因为跟
<7-11,Sheldon>In one case, it's because they've become involved

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,160
<7-11,Sheldon>太古之初就有的地下的森林之子扯上关系
<7-11,Sheldon>with underground tree people from the dawn of time.

233
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
<7-11,Sheldon>是的  但我不会说是谁
<7-11,Sheldon>Yeah, but I won't say who it is.

234
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,900
<7-11,Sheldon>是布兰
<7-11,Sheldon>It's Bran!

235
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,000
<7-12,Howard>发生什么事了
<7-12,Howard>Wait, what is going on?

236
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,270
<7-13,Penny>莱纳德是个混球  所以我们要在这边看剧
<7-13,Penny>Leonard's being a jerk, so we're gonna watch over here,

237
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,810
<7-14,Amy>你们俩想跟我们一起看吗
<7-14,Amy>Do you guys want to watch with us?

238
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,590
<7-15,Howard>只要不跟他一起看就行
<7-15,Howard>As long as I don't have to watch with him.

239
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,110
<7-16,Raj>好啊  我也不想跟你一起看
<7-16,Raj>Fine, I don't want to watch with you either.

00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,260

<7-17,Howard>Why do you get to pick?

242
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,340
<7-18,Raj>好  那你去那边好啦
<7-18,Raj>Okay, then you go there!

<7-20,Leonard>Howard, just come in here.

245
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,870
<7-21,Penny>来这边  拉杰
<7-21,Penny>Yeah, come on, Raj.

246
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,060
<7-22,Raj>慢着  艾米有做菠菜蘸酱吗
<7-22,Raj>Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?

247
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,790
<7-23,Sheldon>做了
<7-23,Sheldon>She did.

248
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,670
<7-24,Howard>老子会帮你吃光光
<7-24,Howard>And I'm gonna eat it all!

249
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,710
<8-1,Howard>到底发生什么事了
<8-1,Howard>So what the hell happened?

250
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,580
<8-2,Leonard>我对谢尔顿的胡闹失去了耐心
<8-2,Leonard>Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon's nonsense.

251
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,870
<8-3,Howard>深有同感  我也受够拉杰了
<8-3,Howard>Tell me about it. I've had it with Raj, too.

252
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,920
<8-4,Amy>其实男人像女人一样
<8-4,Amy>You know, like women,

253
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,710
<8-4,Amy>每个月也会有荷尔蒙变化周期
<8-4,Amy>men have a monthly hormone cycle.

254
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,450
<8-4,Amy>睾丸激素的下降会导致男人易怒
<8-4,Amy>Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.

255
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,620
<8-4,Amy>有意思
<8-4,Amy>Interesting.

256
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,240
<8-5,Howard>或许我的男性周期刚好
<8-5,Howard>Maybe my male cycle synced up

257
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,610
<8-5,Howard>跟拉杰的女性经期同步了
<8-5,Howard>with Raj's actual period.

258
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,450
<8-6,Leonard>如果谢尔顿的睾丸激素下降  他要变成蝴蝶了
<8-6,Leonard>If Sheldon's testosterone dipped, he'd become a butterfly.

259
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,370
<8-6,Leonard>可能有人上门赔礼道歉了
<8-6,Leonard>Maybe someone's here to apologize.

260
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,690
<8-7,Stuart>莱纳德
<8-7,Stuart>Hey, Leonard.

261
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,400
<8-8,Leonard>斯图尔特
<8-8,Leonard>Stuart.

262
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,130
<8-9,Stuart>这不是换装派对吗
<8-9,Stuart>Is this not a dress-up party?

263
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,290
<8-10,Leonard>不是
<8-10,Leonard>No.

264
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,180
<8-11,Stuart>从一开始就不是换装派对吗
<8-11,Stuart>Was it ever a dress-up party?

265
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,420
<8-10,Leonard>不是
<8-10,Leonard>No.

266
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,090
<8-13,Stuart>霍华德  你是不是告诉我这是换装派对
<8-13,Stuart>Howard, didn't you tell me it was a dress-up party?

267
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,410
<8-14,Howard>是的
<8-14,Howard>Yeah.

268
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,520
<9-1,Stuart>据说如果不爽霍华德  就应该来这边
<9-1,Stuart>I was told this is where to go if I'm mad at Howard.

269
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,360
<9-2,Penny>我帮您把斗篷挂起来吧
<9-2,Penny>May I take your cloak?

<9-3,Stuart>Thanks.

271
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,200
<9-3,Stuart>这玩意一直被卷进我自行车的链条里
<9-3,Stuart>This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.

272
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,970
<9-3,Stuart>我来给你说明一下情况
<9-3,Stuart>Well, I'll catch you up.

<9-4,Sheldon>and I'm angry at George R.R. Martin

278
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,190
<9-4,Sheldon>因为他不出新书  害我不能跟莱纳德剧透
<9-4,Sheldon>'cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.

279
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,180
<9-5,Stuart>你和霍华德怎么了
<9-5,Stuart>So what happened with you and Howard?

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,330
<9-6,Raj>我说他就是嫉妒我

<9-6,Raj>我也嫉妒你
<9-6,Raj>I'm jealous.

283

<10-1,Leonard>他简直有病  居然开个会
<10-1,Leonard>He's impossible. I mean, holding a meeting

<10-7,Leonard>他们吵个不停好吗

00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,240
<10-7,Leonard>没有很亲啦
<10-7,Leonard>They aren't that close.

<10-8,Amy>是谁总在他不高兴时安慰他
<10-8,Amy>Who's always comforting him when he's upset?

<10-11,Leonard>我试过把药藏进他的花生酱里
<10-11,Leonard>I try to hide it in his peanut butter,

300
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,020
<10-11,Leonard>但他吐了出来

303
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,210
<10-12,Amy>让她既能得到想要的  又不用跟你吵架吗
<10-12,Amy>so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?

304
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,790
<10-12,Amy>这个贱人

<10-17,Leonard>She defends him all the time.

311
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,680
<10-18,Howard>她才没有
<10-18,Howard>She does not.

312
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,390
<10-19,Amy>是谁告诉你  不要再对他开甘地玩笑的

<10-21,Leonard>你觉得是谁让库萨帕里去人力资源部投诉
<10-21,Leonard>Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?

316
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,230
<10-22,Howard>这个贱人

<11-2,Stuart>Two women, huh?

322
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,890
<11-3,Sheldon (at knock on door)>可能是艾米脑子终于转过来了
<11-3,Sheldon (at knock on door)>Oh, perhaps it's Amy coming to her senses.

323
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:03,910
<11-4,Penny>什么事
<11-4,Penny>What's up?

324
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,120
<11-5,Leonard>其实你没必要利用谢尔顿
<11-5,Leonard>You know, you don't need to use Sheldon to get your way with me

325
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,510
<11-5,Leonard>在愚蠢的《室友协议》里搞定我
<11-5,Leonard>in a dumb Roommate Agreement.

326
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,560
<11-6,Penny>谁告诉你的
<11-6,Penny>Where'd you get that from?

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,550
<11-8,Penny>艾米  你为什么告诉他
<11-8,Penny>Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?

329
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,910
<11-9,Amy>因为你总是替谢尔顿说话
<11-9,Amy>Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.

330
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,570
<11-10,Penny>我没有总替谢尔顿说话
<11-10,Penny>I don't always defend Sheldon.

<11-11,Leonard>与E.T.感情深厚的男主角

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,120
<11-12,Penny>那你对他的诡异情感呢
<11-12,Penny>What about your weird relationship with him?

335
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,180
<11-13,Leonard>那不一样
<11-13,Leonard>That's different.

336
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,630
<11-13,Leonard>我就像是鬼片里不怕死的小女孩
<11-13,Leonard>I'm like the little girl in Poltergeist

337
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,560
<11-13,Leonard>而他就是电视里的那个妖魔鬼怪
<11-13,Leonard>and he's the creepy thing in the TV.

338

<11-14,Howard>Were there any nuts in that food?

340
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,880
<11-15,Leonard>应该没有  怎么了
<11-15,Leonard>I don't think so. Why? Well...

341
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,450
<11-16,Howard>就是有不祥的感觉
<11-16,Howard>just a feeling.

342
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,330
<12-1,Leonard>它就叫意大利三明治
<12-1,Leonard>It just said "Italian sub."

343
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,980
<12-1,Leonard>我没想到意大利香辣肠里会有开心果
<12-1,Leonard>I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.

344
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,650
<12-2,Sheldon>有意思小知识
<12-2,Sheldon>Interesting fact:

345
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,420
<12-2,Sheldon>在意大利语中  意辣肠的前半段有死亡的意思
<12-2,Sheldon>In Italian, the "Morta" In "Mortadella" means death.

346
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,080
<12-3,Amy>谢尔顿
<12-3,Amy>Sheldon.

347
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,670
<12-4,Sheldon>我可没说"有趣"小知识  我又不是冷血怪物
<12-4,Sheldon>I didn't say "fun" fact. I'm not a monster.

348
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,570
<12-5,Bernadette>他不会有事的
<12-5,Bernadette>He's gonna be okay.

349
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,340
<12-6,Sheldon>现在就是有趣小知识了
<12-6,Sheldon>Now it's a fun fact.

350
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,760
<12-7,Stuart>天啊  这种事情真能让人更理智看问题
<12-7,Stuart>Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.

351
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,510
<12-8,Bernadette>你为什么穿成这样子
<12-8,Bernadette>Why are you dressed like that?

352
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,130
<12-9,Stuart>霍华德骗我这是个换装派对
<12-9,Stuart>Oh, uh, Howard thought it'd be funny

353
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,270
<12-9,Stuart>他觉得看我出糗很有意思
<12-9,Stuart>to tell me it was a costume party.

354
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,320
<12-10,Bernadette>这太坏了吧
<12-10,Bernadette>That wasn't nice.

355
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,060
<12-11,Stuart>不过他差点死了  我们扯平了
<12-11,Stuart>No, but he almost died, so we're cool.

356
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,980
<12-12,Raj>仔细想一想  其实今晚就像
<12-12,Raj>You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,390
<12-12,Raj>现实版的《权力的游戏》
<12-12,Raj>a real-life Game of Thrones.

<12-13,Amy>怎么会
<12-13,Amy>How?

359
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,430
<12-14,Raj>霍华德吃下开心果
<12-14,Raj>Well, Howard eating that pistachio

360
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,440
<12-14,Raj>就像乔佛里被毒死那幕
<12-14,Raj>was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.

361
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,150
<12-15,Penny>可那是谋杀  这是意外
<12-15,Penny>Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.

362
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,620
<12-15,Penny>好的
<12-15,Penny>Okay.

363
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,970
<12-16,Raj>可你利用谢尔顿去干那些肮脏勾当
<12-16,Raj>But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work

364
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,200
<12-16,Raj>正像瑟后利用御林铁卫执行她的命令一样
<12-16,Raj>is like when Cersei used the King's Guard to do her bidding.

365
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,390
<12-17,Sheldon>瑟后是靠卖肉操控男人
<12-17,Sheldon>Cersei uses her body to manipulate men.

366
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,180
<12-17,Sheldon>佩妮只是带我去了乐高店
<12-17,Sheldon>Penny just takes me to The LEGO store.

367
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,680
<12-18,Raj>好的  那这个呢
<12-18,Raj>Okay. Oh, how about this?

368
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,280
<12-18,Raj>斯图尔特穿得像个守夜人的兄弟
<12-18,Raj>Stuart's dressed like a brother of the Night's Watch,

369
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,040
<12-18,Raj>而他们没女人睡
<12-18,Raj>and they don't have sex.

370
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,890
<12-19,Penny>-说得好  -没有错
<12-19,Penny>- There you go. - That's true.

371
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,800
<12-21,Sheldon>没瑕疵
<12-21,Sheldon>Fair enough.

372
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,210
<12-24,Bernadette>-你没事吧  -没事
<12-24,Bernadette>- You all right? - I'm fine.

373
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,050
<12-25,Howard>就是觉得被人像抱婴儿一样抱下楼
<12-25,Howard>Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs

374
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,720
<12-25,Howard>有点丢人
<12-25,Howard>like a baby.

375
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,780
<12-25,Howard>谢了
<12-25,Howard>Thanks.

376
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,630
<12-26,Leonard>我们走吧
<12-26,Leonard>Let's get out of here.

377
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,910
<12-27,Amy>太吓人了
<12-27,Amy>That was scary.

378
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,280
<12-28,Sheldon>重点是
<12-28,Sheldon>Well, the important thing is

379
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,290
<12-28,Sheldon>我说过那个三明治会毁了一切的
<12-28,Sheldon>I said that big sandwich would ruin everything,

380
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,970
<12-28,Sheldon>被我言中了吧
<12-28,Sheldon>and I was right.

381
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,910
<13-1,Raj (shouting from upstairs window)>琼恩·雪诺
<13-1,Raj (shouting from upstairs window)>Hey, Jon Snow!

382
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,850
<13-1,Raj (shouting from upstairs window)>你的马上怎么还有个篮子
<13-1,Raj (shouting from upstairs window)>How come your horse has a basket on it?

383
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,120
<13-2,Stuart>你的脑袋上怎么还有张脸
<13-2,Stuart>How come your head has your face on it?

384
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,060
<13-3,Sheldon>《权力的游戏》里可不会戴自行车头盔
<13-3,Sheldon>They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones.

385
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,220
<13-3,Sheldon>虽然你装扮有瑕疵
<13-3,Sheldon>You're thematically inaccurate,

386
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,780
<13-3,Sheldon>但我为你的安全意识点赞
<13-3,Sheldon>but I applaud your commitment to safety.

387
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,260
<13-4,Stuart>你们就没别的正经事可干了吗
<13-4,Stuart>Don't you guys have anything better to do?

388
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,230
<13-5,Leonard>比看一个穿皮草斗篷的人
<13-5,Leonard>Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak

389
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,620
<13-5,Leonard>骑妇女车还重要的事吗  没有
<13-5,Leonard>ride a girl's bike? Nope.

390
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,260
<13-5,Leonard>够了
<13-5,Leonard>That's it,

391
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,940
<13-6,Stuart>你们刚刚失去了漫画店里的厕所特权
<13-6,Stuart>you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store.

392
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,870
<13-6,Stuart>有篮子的马  一群傻子
<13-6,Stuart>Horse has a basket on it. Stupid...

393
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,020
<14-1,Sheldon>莱纳德
<14-1,Sheldon>Leonard.

394
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,280
<14-1,Sheldon>莱纳德  莱纳德
<14-1,Sheldon>Leonard. Leonard.

395
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,670
<14-2,Leonard>干嘛
<14-2,Leonard>What?

396
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,260
<14-3,Sheldon>我还一直没机会问你那个蝙蝠人的问题
<14-3,Sheldon>I never got to ask my question about Batman.

397
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,640
<14-4,Leonard>什么问题
<14-4,Leonard>What is it?

398
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,750
<14-5,Sheldon>如果蝙蝠人被一个放射性的人蝠咬了后
<14-5,Sheldon>If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat,

399
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,110
<14-5,Sheldon>然后穿成人蝠的样子去打击犯罪
<14-5,Sheldon>and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat,

400
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,170
<14-5,Sheldon>那他是人蝠人蝠人吗
<14-5,Sheldon>would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man

401
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,360
<14-5,Sheldon>还是人蝠人蝠蝙蝠人
<14-5,Sheldon>or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?

402
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,760
<14-6,Penny>他在人蝠装的底下还穿着蝙蝠人装吗
<14-6,Penny>Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?

403
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,340
<14-7,Sheldon>容我思考一下再回来
<14-7,Sheldon>I'll be back.
