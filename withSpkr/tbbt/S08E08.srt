1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,670
<1-1,Leonard>我们昨晚在铁板烧店碰见你妈了
<1-1,Leonard>Oh, hey, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,480
<1-2,Howard>是啊  她超爱去那里
<1-2,Howard>Uh, yeah, she loves that place.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,040
<1-2,Howard>每次大厨把大虾翻炒到空中时
<1-2,Howard>Every time they flip a shrimp in the air,

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,900
<1-2,Howard>她会一个飞扑上去叼住
<1-2,Howard>she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,670
<1-2,Howard>所以我从不带她去海洋公园[喂海豚]
<1-2,Howard>That's why I don't take her to the Seaworld.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,700
<1-3,Leonard>我知道你不想听到这事
<1-3,Leonard>I know you don't want to hear it,

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,540
<1-3,Leonard>但是她是跟斯图尔特一起去的
<1-3,Leonard>but she was there with Stuart.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,780
<1-4,Howard>随便啊  我又无所谓
<1-4,Howard>That's fine. I don't care.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,670
<1-5,Rajj>他们出去约会你不会不爽吗
<1-5,Rajj>It doesn't bug you when they go out on dates?

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,750
<1-6,Howard>他们不是约会
<1-6,Howard>They're not dating.

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,650
<1-6,Howard>只是两个朋友一起出去吃饭
<1-6,Howard>They're just two friends who went out to dinner.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,610
<1-7,Raj>吃完一起回他们共住的房子
<1-7,Raj>And then went back to the home they share

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,720
<1-7,Raj>没准睡觉时两人还穿着
<1-7,Raj>where they probably fell asleep

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,230
<1-7,Raj>你妈妈买的情侣睡衣
<1-7,Raj>in the matching pajamas she got them

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,190
<1-7,Raj>因为他们俩都喜欢企鹅
<1-7,Raj>because they both just love penguins.

16
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,040
<1-8,Howard>很多不是情侣的人也穿着情侣睡衣啊
<1-8,Howard>Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,150
<1-9,Raj>比如说
<1-9,Raj>Like who?

18
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,170
<1-10,Howard>你和你的狗
<1-10,Howard>Like you and your dog.

19
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,830
<1-11,Leonard>话别说太早哦
<1-11,Leonard>Don't rule out the dating.

20
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,440
<1-12,Howard>行  我心里超不爽
<1-12,Howard>Fine, it bothers me.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,460
<1-12,Howard>你们高兴了吧
<1-12,Howard>You happy?

22
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,520
<1-13,Sheldon>你这问题算什么啊
<1-13,Sheldon>You think you've got problems.

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,420
<1-13,Sheldon>长臂猿是人猿总科中
<1-13,Sheldon>The gibbon is the only member of the ape family

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,330
<1-13,Sheldon>唯一不是大猿的猿类
<1-13,Sheldon>not classified as a great ape.

25
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,540
<1-14,Howard>你这话对我有啥帮助
<1-14,Howard>How is this helpful?

26
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,590
<1-15,Sheldon>所有非人类的猩猩
<1-15,Sheldon>All the non-human apes are classified

27
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,560
<1-15,Sheldon>全都归在人猿总科下的人科里
<1-15,Sheldon>as great apes except one.

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,430
<1-15,Sheldon>这就表示
<1-15,Sheldon>That means

29
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,720
<1-15,Sheldon>分类学家创造了小猿这个分类
<1-15,Sheldon>taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,570
<1-15,Sheldon>来孤立可怜的长臂猿
<1-15,Sheldon>just to single out the poor gibbon

31
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,990
<1-15,Sheldon>他就像操场上被排挤的小孩
<1-15,Sheldon>as the weird kid on the playground.

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,940
<1-15,Sheldon>这些毛茸茸的小伙心中才是真不爽呢
<1-15,Sheldon>Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,110
<1-16,Leonard>但是长臂猿们不知道自己被分类成什么
<1-16,Leonard>But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as.

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,260
<1-16,Leonard>它们都不知道自己叫长臂猿
<1-16,Leonard>It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.

35
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,520
<1-16,Leonard>这倒是
<1-16,Leonard>True.

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,920
<1-17,Sheldon>抱歉  兄台  你比长臂猿还惨
<1-17,Sheldon>Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon.

43
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,330
<2-3,Bernadette>电影之夜我们带零食来了
<2-3,Bernadette>We brought snacks for movie night.

44
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,130
<2-4,Penny>太好了
<2-4,Penny>Oh, great.

45
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,700
<2-4,Penny>你们不会顺便还带了餐巾纸  干净的碗
<2-4,Penny>I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls,

46
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,720
<2-4,Penny>餐具外加一卷厕纸吧
<2-4,Penny>utensils and a roll of toilet paper.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,460
<2-5,Bernadette>还真带了
<2-5,Bernadette>Right here.

48
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,120
<2-6,Penny>你们最好了
<2-6,Penny>You guys are the best.

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,390
<2-7,Amy>这些衣服是怎么回事
<2-7,Amy>What's with the clothes?

50
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,920
<2-8,Penny>我为了工作买了不少职业装
<2-8,Penny>Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work,

51
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,890
<2-8,Penny>衣橱得清出一些空位啊
<2-8,Penny>I needed to make room in my closet.

52
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,290
<2-9,Amy>我是问这次衣服怎么是叠好的
<2-9,Amy>I meant why are they folded?

53
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,680
<2-9,Amy>不过随便吧
<2-9,Amy>But whatever.

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,340
<2-9,Amy>这件是干嘛的
<2-9,Amy>Ooh, what's this?

55
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,280
<2-10,Penny>说了怕你们不信  那是我当年的毕业舞会裙
<2-10,Penny>That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,290
<2-11,Bernadette>你还留着啊
<2-11,Bernadette>Wow, you still have it?

57
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,790
<2-11,Bernadette>我还以为会急忙中被揉成一团
<2-11,Bernadette>I just assumed it was balled up

58
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,540
<2-11,Bernadette>丢到谷仓的某个角落去了
<2-11,Bernadette>in the corner of a barn somewhere.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,230
<2-12,Penny>你把我当年想成是哪种人了啊
<2-12,Penny>What kind of teenager did you think I was?

60
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,840
<2-13,Bernadette>-淫荡  -风骚
<2-13,Bernadette>- Slutty. - Easy.

61
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,060
<2-15,Penny>那是叫"受欢迎"好吗
<2-15,Penny>The word is "popular."

62
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,110
<2-16,Bernadette>你当年的舞会如何  你去了吗
<2-16,Bernadette>How was your prom? Did you go?

63
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,940
<2-17,Amy>没  但我去打扫了
<2-17,Amy>No, but I was on clean-up crew.

64
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,680
<2-18,Penny>太可怜了
<2-18,Penny>Aw, that's sad.

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,010
<2-19,Amy>不会  其实也还行
<2-19,Amy>No, it was okay.

66
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,660
<2-19,Amy>DJ在收工前  让我与我的拖把
<2-19,Amy>The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop

67
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,530
<2-19,Amy>共舞了一曲慢歌
<2-19,Amy>before he shut down.

68
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,310
<2-19,Amy>每当我看到一桶脏水
<2-19,Amy>Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water,

69
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,310
<2-19,Amy>耳边还会响起那曲《红衣女郎》
<2-19,Amy>I still hear "Lady in Red."

70
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,180
<2-20,Bernadette>我当年的舞会也挺糟糕
<2-20,Bernadette>My prom was pretty terrible, too.

71
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,610
<2-20,Bernadette>当时我超兴奋那个男生来约我
<2-20,Bernadette>I was so excited about my date,

72
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,820
<2-20,Bernadette>结果发现他是为了泡我朋友
<2-20,Bernadette>but it turned out he only asked me

73
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,290
<2-20,Bernadette>所以才来约我
<2-20,Bernadette>'cause he liked my friend.

74
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,320
<2-20,Bernadette>他一整个晚上都在聊我的朋友
<2-20,Bernadette>He spent the whole night talking about her.

75
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,420
<2-21,Amy>行行行  你有朋友又有人约
<2-21,Amy>Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date.

76
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,070
<2-21,Amy>少显摆了好吗
<2-21,Amy>Stop bragging.

77
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,940
<2-22,Penny>无所谓啦
<2-22,Penny>Doesn't matter.

78
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,180
<2-22,Penny>毕业舞会蠢爆了
<2-22,Penny>Prom is silly anyways.

79
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,120
<2-23,Bernadette>你说当然容易
<2-23,Bernadette>Easy for you to say;

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,430
<2-23,Bernadette>你当年估计是跟橄榄球队队长一起去的
<2-23,Bernadette>you probably went with the captain of the football team.

81
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,030
<2-23,Bernadette>才不是
<2-23,Bernadette>No.

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,430
<2-24,Penny>我只是趁他的舞伴喝吐时
<2-24,Penny>I just made out with him a little

83
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,350
<2-24,Penny>偷偷跟他亲热了一番
<2-24,Penny>while his date was puking.

84
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,330
<2-25,Amy>那呕吐物就会是我的舞伴拖把来清理
<2-25,Amy>My date would've had to clean that up.

85
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,220
<2-26,Bernadette>我有个主意
<2-26,Bernadette>Ooh, I have an idea.

86
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,940
<2-26,Bernadette>我们可以来一个二次舞会啊
<2-26,Bernadette>Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.

87
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,930
<2-27,Amy>那应该会很好玩吧
<2-27,Amy>Oh, that would be so much fun.

88
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,880
<2-27,Amy>我们可以布置一下屋顶  让他们穿晚礼服
<2-27,Amy>We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.

89
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,010
<2-28,Bernadette>我们也去弄好头发  然后与他们跳慢舞
<2-28,Bernadette>Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.

90
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,950
<2-29,Penny>两位  相信我
<2-29,Penny>Okay, guys, trust me,

91
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,790
<2-29,Penny>作为去过大概有七场毕业舞会的人
<2-29,Penny>as someone who's been to, like, seven proms,

92
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,100
<2-29,Penny>舞会永远不会如你们想象中那般美好
<2-29,Penny>it is never as good as you want it to be.

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,470
<2-30,Amy>你去了七场舞会吗
<2-30,Amy>You went to seven proms?

94
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,560
<2-30,Amy>对  我想想
<2-30,Amy>Yeah, let's see.

95
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,700
<2-31,Penny>四场"深海主题"  两场"魔法奇缘"
<2-31,Penny>Uh, four "Under the Seas," Two "Enchanted Evenings,"

96
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,360
<2-31,Penny>一场"难忘之夜"
<2-31,Penny>and one "Night to Remember"

97
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,220
<2-31,Penny>那一夜我可是喝到一点都记不得
<2-31,Penny>that... I cannot remember for the life of me.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,100
<3-3,Leonard>伯纳黛特呢
<3-3,Leonard>Hey, where's Bernadette?

99
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,740
<3-4,Howard>她跟艾米出去买舞会的礼服了
<3-4,Howard>She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.

100
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,610
<3-5,Raj>我有收到电邮邀请
<3-5,Raj>Oh, yeah, I got that Evite.

101
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,980
<3-5,Raj>我看完《红粉佳人》后
<3-5,Raj>Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink,

102
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,290
<3-5,Raj>1986年青春爱情校园电影
<3-5,Raj>片中有毕业舞会桥段

103
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,290
<3-5,Raj>我也好想参加美国人的毕业舞会
<3-5,Raj>I've wanted to go to an American prom.

104
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,210
<3-5,Raj>但看完《魔女嘉丽》
<3-5,Raj>But then I saw Carrie,

105
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,040
<3-5,Raj>惊悚电影  有1976与2013两个版本
<3-5,Raj>片中女主角在舞会上展开了一场大屠杀

106
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,140
<3-5,Raj>我又一点都不想参加美国的毕业舞会了
<3-5,Raj>and I did not want to go to an American prom.

107
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,960
<3-5,Raj>但我又看了《一吻定江山》
<3-5,Raj>But then I saw Never Been Kissed,

109
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,100
<3-5,Raj>我又重新想参加毕业舞会了
<3-5,Raj>and I'm back on the prom bandwagon.

110
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,120
<3-5,Raj>毕业舞会这事真让我的心大起大落啊
<3-5,Raj>This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.

111
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,190
<3-6,Howard>妮妮很兴奋呢
<3-6,Howard>Bernie's really excited.

112
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,230
<3-6,Howard>我知道她兴奋是因为她声音变超尖
<3-6,Howard>I-I could tell because her voice got so high,

113
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,200
<3-6,Howard>隔壁的狗听到都开始狗嚎了
<3-6,Howard>the beagle next door started howling.

115
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,300
<3-7,Raj>你有去毕业舞会吗
<3-7,Raj>Did you go to your prom?

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,390
<3-7,Raj>没
<3-7,Raj>No.

117
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,190
<3-8,Sheldon>因为我与当个好学生有个约会
<3-8,Sheldon>I had a date with a proper education.

118
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,790
<3-8,Sheldon>比起一身燕尾服  我养成一身好习惯
<3-8,Sheldon>Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits.

119
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,120
<3-8,Sheldon>比起掺了烈酒的潘趣酒
<3-8,Sheldon>Instead of spiked punch,

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,410
<3-8,Sheldon>我更喜欢知识醉人的味道
<3-8,Sheldon>I enjoyed the intoxicating flavor of knowledge.

122
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,130
<3-8,Sheldon>比起在体育馆里跳舞
<3-8,Sheldon>Instead of dancing in a gym,

123
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,590
<3-8,Sheldon>我更愿意随着AP微积分诱人的节奏
<3-8,Sheldon>I shook my booty to the seductive rhythms...

124
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,750
<3-9,Penny>够了够了
<3-9,Penny>Okay, okay.

125
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,910
<3-10,Shldon>...抖屁股
<3-10,Shldon>...of AP Calculus.

126
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,370
<3-11,Raj>你怎么没有跟艾米和伯纳黛特一起去采购呢
<3-11,Raj>How come you're not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?

127
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,920
<3-12,Leonard>我来猜猜  你觉得这个舞会主意烂爆了
<3-12,Leonard>Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?

128
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,610
<3-13,Penny>不要管我怎么想  你觉得如何
<3-13,Penny>Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?

129
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,380
<3-14,Leonard>老实说
<3-14,Leonard>Hmm, to be honest,

130
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,510
<3-14,Leonard>即使这是个假的毕业舞会  但能有你这么美的舞伴
<3-14,Leonard>it's kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom

131
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,570
<3-14,Leonard>也算是美梦成真吧
<3-14,Leonard>with a woman as beautiful as you.

132
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,130
<3-15,Penny>真是谢谢了
<3-15,Penny>Ugh, thanks a lot.

133
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,710
<3-16,Leonard>怎么了
<3-16,Leonard>What?

134
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,290
<3-17,Penny>要是我说不想参加  不就成了坏女人了吗
<3-17,Penny>Well, now I can't blow this thing off without being a bitch.

135
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,460
<3-18,Raj>所以说她答应了
<3-18,Raj>That sounds like a "Yes"!

136
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,160
<4-1,Bernadette>每一位受邀的人都回复说参加
<4-1,Bernadette>Ooh, every single person RSVP'd "Yes."

137
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,910
<4-1,Bernadette>真是太让人激动了
<4-1,Bernadette>This is so exciting!

138
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,250
<4-1,Bernadette>你说是不是呀
<4-1,Bernadette>Isn't this exciting?

139
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,760
<4-2,Howard>是
<4-2,Howard>Yep.

140
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,630
<4-3,Bernadette>就连斯尔图特都要带舞伴来
<4-3,Bernadette>Look, even Stuart's bringing a date.

141
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,710
<4-3,Bernadette>真好奇那人是谁
<4-3,Bernadette>I wonder who it is.

142
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,650
<4-4,Howard>你明明知道那人是谁
<4-4,Howard>You know exactly who it is.

143
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,760
<4-4,Howard>我妈就是他的舞伴
<4-4,Howard>He's gonna bring my mom.

144
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,280
<4-4,Howard>你干嘛要邀请他啊
<4-4,Howard>Why did you even invite him?

145
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,170
<4-5,Bernadette>因为他是我们的朋友  你们俩必须和睦相处
<4-5,Bernadette>Because he's our friend, and you two need to get along.

146
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,420
<4-5,Bernadette>再说了  他为什么不能带你妈来
<4-5,Bernadette>And why can't he take your mom?

147
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,770
<4-5,Bernadette>你毕业舞会的时候不也带了吗
<4-5,Bernadette>You took her to your prom.

148
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,050
<4-6,Howard>我没有"带"她去  她是去"监护"我
<4-6,Howard>I didn't "Take" her; she was a chaperone.

149
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,080
<4-7,Bernadette>我见过一张你们一起跳舞的照片
<4-7,Bernadette>I saw a picture of you two dancing together.

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,230
<4-8,Howard>不能怪我
<4-8,Howard>W-What was I gonna do?

151
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,480
<4-8,Howard>当时在播我们爱的主打歌
<4-8,Howard>They were playing our song!

152
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,970
<4-8,Howard>我受不了了
<4-8,Howard>I can't take this anymore.

153
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,660
<4-9,Stuart (on phone)>你好
<4-9,Stuart (on phone)>Hello.

154
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,240
<4-10,Howard>斯尔图特  我们得谈谈
<4-10,Howard>Stuart, we have to talk.

155
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,350
<4-10,Howard>你跟我妈那点事儿
<4-10,Howard>This thing with you and my mom,

156
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,800
<4-10,Howard>让我超不爽
<4-10,Howard>I-I hate it.

157
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,230
<4-10,Howard>都快把我逼疯了
<4-10,Howard>It's making me crazy.

158
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,870
<4-10,Howard>你我是多年的朋友了
<4-10,Howard>You and I were friends for years,

159
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,120
<4-10,Howard>如今你却要带我妈去参加
<4-10,Howard>and now you're bringing my mother to a party

160
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,470
<4-10,Howard>我也在场的舞会
<4-10,Howard>I'm going to?!

161
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,820
<4-10,Howard>太离谱了吧
<4-10,Howard>What the hell?!

162
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,150
<4-11,Stuart>我没有要带你妈去啊  我有其他舞伴
<4-11,Stuart>I'm not bringing your mother, I have a date.

163
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,170
<4-12,Howard>所以你现在是背着我妈偷吃吗
<4-12,Howard>Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother?

164
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,180
<4-13,Stuart>你在胡说什么呀
<4-13,Stuart>Wha-What are you talking about?

165
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,360
<4-13,Stuart>我和你妈之前完全不存在任何逾越之举
<4-13,Stuart>There's nothing weird going on with me and your mother.

166
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,110
<4-14,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>图仔  你的洗澡水要凉了哦
<4-14,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Stewie, your bath is getting cold!

167
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,290
<4-15,Stuart>我得挂了  再见
<4-15,Stuart>I got to go, bye.

168
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,050
<5-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<5-1,Sheldon>Penny?

169
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,330
<5-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<5-1,Sheldon>Penny.

170
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,640
<5-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<5-1,Sheldon>Penny.

171
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,940
<5-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<5-1,Sheldon>Penny.

172
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,560
<5-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<5-1,Sheldon>Penny.

173
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,550
<5-2,Penny>今天敲门的次数比平时多呀
<5-2,Penny>You knocked more than usual.

174
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,010
<5-3,Sheldon>下次我可能有急事
<5-3,Sheldon>Next time I might be in a rush,

175
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,090
<5-3,Sheldon>先多敲两下存着吧
<5-3,Sheldon>it's good to have a few in the bank.

176
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,650
<5-4,Penny>找我干嘛
<5-4,Penny>Okay, what's up?

177
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,760
<5-5,Sheldon>我想跟你讨论下
<5-5,Sheldon>I'd like to discuss this party

178
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,940
<5-5,Sheldon>艾米和伯纳黛特举办的这个舞会
<5-5,Sheldon>that Amy and Bernadette are throwing.

179
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,410
<5-5,Sheldon>既然我和你都不想参加
<5-5,Sheldon>Since you and I are both reluctant to go,

180
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,080
<5-5,Sheldon>我想到了一个让我们乐在其中的完美方法
<5-5,Sheldon>I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.

181
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,530
<5-6,Penny>好呀  怎么做
<5-6,Penny>Great, how?

182
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,900
<5-7,Sheldon>假装我们是外星人
<5-7,Sheldon>We pretend we're aliens.

183
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,750
<5-7,Sheldon>我不擅长阅读面部表情
<5-7,Sheldon>I'm not the best at reading facial cues,

184
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,810
<5-7,Sheldon>但我猜你很喜欢这主意  并想深入了解它
<5-7,Sheldon>but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more.

185
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,000
<5-7,Sheldon>在受人喜爱的小说
<5-7,Sheldon>Now, in the beloved novel

186
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,750
<5-7,Sheldon>《银河系漫游指南》中
<5-7,Sheldon>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

187
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,380
<5-7,Sheldon>一位叫福特·派法特的外星人为了混进人类世界
<5-7,Sheldon>an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human

188
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,630
<5-7,Sheldon>假扮人类
<5-7,Sheldon>in order to blend in

189
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,720
<5-7,Sheldon>目的就是为替《银河系漫游指南》
<5-7,Sheldon>so that he could write an entry about Earth

190
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,660
<5-7,Sheldon>写一本地球指南
<5-7,Sheldon>for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

191
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,420
<5-7,Sheldon>而这本旅游指南恰恰是一本真书的一部分
<5-7,Sheldon>which is a travel book within the actual book,

192
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,540
<5-7,Sheldon>而那本真书名字就叫
<5-7,Sheldon>which is also called

193
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,900
<5-7,Sheldon>《银河系漫游指南》
<5-7,Sheldon>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

194
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,080
<5-8,Penny>我只有一个问题
<5-8,Penny>Okay, just one question.

195
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,640
<5-8,Penny>你说什么
<5-8,Penny>What?

196
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,600
<5-9,Sheldon>我的意思是  假装外星人
<5-9,Sheldon>My point is, pretending to be an alien is

197
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,580
<5-9,Sheldon>是我使用过多次非常有用的应对机制
<5-9,Sheldon>a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times.

198
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,630
<5-9,Sheldon>我第一次去看你演出时就用过
<5-9,Sheldon>I did it the first time I went to see you in a play.

199
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,320
<5-9,Sheldon>你根本不知道观众里有
<5-9,Sheldon>You had no idea Commander Umfrumf

200
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,910
<5-9,Sheldon>来自天囷星的指挥官
<5-9,Sheldon>of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience.

201
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,610
<5-9,Sheldon>别担心  他竖起七根大拇指叫好哦
<5-9,Sheldon>Oh, d-don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,230
<5-10,Penny>那么问题来了
<5-10,Penny>Here's a question--

203
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,700
<5-10,Penny>作为假扮人类的外星人
<5-10,Penny>as an alien pretending to be human,

204
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,550
<5-10,Penny>你打算跟艾米遵循
<5-10,Penny>are you planning to engage in any

205
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,810
<5-11,Sheldon>舞会后人类交配的惯例吗
<5-11,Sheldon>post-prom mating rituals with Amy?

206
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,480
<5-11,Sheldon>舞会后还有交配的惯例吗
<5-11,Sheldon>There are post-prom mating rituals?

207
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,280
<5-12,Penny>也不尽然啦
<5-12,Penny>Not always.

208
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,630
<5-12,Penny>但如果你舞伴的货车上有充气床垫
<5-12,Penny>Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress,

209
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,060
<5-12,Penny>那就是惯例啦
<5-12,Penny>then always.

210
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,090
<5-13,Sheldon>如果这是舞会体验的一部分  那我愿意接受
<5-13,Sheldon>Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.

211
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,970
<5-14,Penny>你开玩笑呢吧
<5-14,Penny>You're kidding.

212
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,860
<5-15,Sheldon>我或许是个外星人  但我也有冲动啊
<5-15,Sheldon>I may be an alien, but I have urges.

213
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,140
<5-15,Sheldon>如果艾米想交配  把卵子发射进太空
<5-15,Sheldon>If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space,

214
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,850
<5-15,Sheldon>那好  我很乐意用
<5-15,Sheldon>well, then, I will happily catch them

215
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,180
<5-15,Sheldon>我"上殖器"的生殖囊兜住它们
<5-15,Sheldon>with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin.

216
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,160
<5-15,Sheldon>虽然我不擅长阅读面部表情
<5-15,Sheldon>I'm not the best at reading facial cues,

217
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,630
<5-15,Sheldon>但我能看出你有点小性奋哦
<5-15,Sheldon>but I can see that you're a little turned on.

218
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,130
<6-1,Leonard>如果你懒得学怎么系领结
<6-1,Leonard>You know, if you're not gonna learn how to do this,

219
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,020
<6-1,Leonard>有很多夹上去的领结也很漂亮
<6-1,Leonard>they make some pretty good clip-ons.

220
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,220
<6-2,Sheldon>布鲁斯·韦恩[蝙蝠侠]才不用夹上去的领结
<6-2,Sheldon>Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.

221
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,750
<6-3,Leonard>布鲁斯·韦恩也不会让他的室友帮忙系啊
<6-3,Leonard>Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.

222
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,110
<6-4,Sheldon>他的室友[管家]阿福  会帮他系领带啊
<6-4,Sheldon>His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.

223
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,150
<6-5,Leonard>好了  完美
<6-5,Leonard>There, perfect.

224
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,170
<6-6,Sheldon>你确定吗
<6-6,Sheldon>What, are you sure?

225
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,900
<6-6,Sheldon>这是我人生第一场毕业舞会  我可得按照规矩来
<6-6,Sheldon>It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.

226
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,790
<6-7,Leonard>我以为你要打破常规扮外星人呢
<6-7,Leonard>I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.

227
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,250
<6-8,Sheldon>我想来着  不过佩妮不想
<6-8,Sheldon>I was, but Penny didn't want to.

228
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,060
<6-8,Sheldon>你也不想
<6-8,Sheldon>You didn't want to.

229
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,020
<6-8,Sheldon>伯纳黛特  艾米
<6-8,Sheldon>Bernadette, Amy,

230
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,530
<6-8,Sheldon>库萨帕里和沃罗威茨都不想
<6-8,Sheldon>Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to.

231
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,100
<6-8,Sheldon>而连我都知道  请临演来会很怪
<6-8,Sheldon>And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.

232
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,150
<6-9,Leonard>那是酒壶吗
<6-9,Leonard>Was that a flask?

233
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,240
<6-9,Leonard>是的
<6-9,Leonard>Yes.

234
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,300
<6-10,Sheldon>我决定接受所有和舞会
<6-10,Sheldon>I've decided to embrace all of the traditions

235
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,710
<6-10,Sheldon>相关的传统  包括在潘趣酒里掺烈酒
<6-10,Sheldon>associated with prom, including spiking the punch.

236
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,670
<6-11,Leonard>你要在潘趣酒里掺烈酒
<6-11,Leonard>You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?

237
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,840
<6-12,Sheldon>才不  这是石榴汁
<6-12,Sheldon>Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice.

238
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,760
<6-12,Sheldon>用保护细胞老化的抗氧化物
<6-12,Sheldon>It's all the fun of high school high jinks

239
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,660
<6-12,Sheldon>来玩高中生寻欢作乐的游戏
<6-12,Sheldon>with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.

240
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,670
<6-13,Leonard>如果你再穿上破烂的牛仔裤和皮夹克
<6-13,Leonard>If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket,

241
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,710
<6-13,Leonard>你就可以当迪士尼儿童台中的校霸了
<6-13,Leonard>you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel.

242
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,390
<6-13,Leonard>今晚还有什么安排吗
<6-13,Leonard>So, anything else planned for tonight?

243
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,810
<6-14,Sheldon>舞会一切要做的事
<6-14,Sheldon>Oh, everything.

244
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,660
<6-14,Sheldon>跟大家照相  慢舞
<6-14,Sheldon>Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing,

245
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,770
<6-14,Sheldon>被选为舞会国王
<6-14,Sheldon>being elected prom king.

246
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,370
<6-14,Sheldon>再指正大家国王不是民选的
<6-14,Sheldon>Pointing out that kings aren't elected.

247
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,700
<6-14,Sheldon>到时候肯定爽翻天
<6-14,Sheldon>It's gonna be off the hook.

248
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,600
<6-15,Leonard>既然你提起了
<6-15,Leonard>And while you're at it,

249
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,220
<6-15,Leonard>我知道在这个年龄你的荷尔蒙激增
<6-15,Leonard>I know that at this age your hormones are raging,

250
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,820
<6-15,Leonard>虽然你的朋友们都在嘿咻
<6-15,Leonard>but just because all your friends are having sex

251
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,730
<6-15,Leonard>不见得你也非得去做
<6-15,Leonard>doesn't mean you have to.

252
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,500
<6-16,Sheldon>你何出此言
<6-16,Sheldon>Why would you say that?

253
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,420
<6-17,Leonard>因为...
<6-17,Leonard>You know, 'cause...

254
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,050
<6-17,Leonard>很多人的初夜都是在毕业舞会上失去的
<6-17,Leonard>'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.

255
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,780
<6-18,Sheldon>佩妮也暗示过这个
<6-18,Sheldon>Penny implied the same thing.

256
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,850
<6-18,Sheldon>是真的吗
<6-18,Sheldon>Is this true?

257
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,400
<6-19,Leonard>放轻松  我开玩笑的
<6-19,Leonard>Just relax, it's a joke.

258
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,660
<6-19,Leonard>你根本没有荷尔蒙
<6-19,Leonard>You don't have hormones.

259
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,680
<7-1,Leonard>你真漂亮
<7-1,Leonard>Wow, you look amazing.

260
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,850
<7-2,Penny>谢谢  你也很帅
<7-2,Penny>Thank you, so do you.

261
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,500
<7-3,Amy>谢尔顿  你真帅气
<7-3,Amy>Sheldon, you look so handsome.

262
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,500
<7-4,Sheldon>谢谢
<7-4,Sheldon>Thank you.

263
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,580
<7-5,Penny>谢尔顿  艾米不漂亮吗
<7-5,Penny>Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

264
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,710
<7-5,Penny>是不是让你的"上殖器"都活跃起来啦
<7-5,Penny>That's got to put some starch in the upper flermin.

265
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,970
<7-6,Amy>什么东西
<7-6,Amy>What's that?

266
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,710
<7-7,Leonard>那是长在他肩胛骨之间的
<7-7,Leonard>Oh, it's a scaly genital organ

267
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,410
<7-7,Leonard>鳞状生殖器
<7-7,Leonard>that grows between his shoulder blades.

268
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,530
<7-7,Leonard>跳舞的时候小心别碰着了
<7-7,Leonard>Try not to touch it when you're dancing.

269
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,940
<7-8,Sheldon>失陪了
<7-8,Sheldon>Excuse me.

270
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,910
<7-9,Amy>你去哪里
<7-9,Amy>Where are you going?

271
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,370
<7-9,Amy>我做不到
<7-9,Amy>I can't do this.

272
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,580
<7-10,Sheldon>莱纳德  我告诉你
<7-10,Sheldon>And for your information, Leonard,

273
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,670
<7-10,Sheldon>"上殖器"不是长在我的肩胛骨之间
<7-10,Sheldon>the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades,

274
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,130
<7-10,Sheldon>而是从我脖子的肚脐孔上长出来的
<7-10,Sheldon>it grows out of the belly button on my neck.

275
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,190
<7-11,Leonard>他说得对  我刚才说成"下殖器"了
<7-11,Leonard>He's right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.

276
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,550
<8-1,Raj>我给斯图尔特发短信  说我们快到了
<8-1,Raj>Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we're close.

277
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,280
<8-2,Bernadette>你的纹身真好看
<8-2,Bernadette>That's a neat tattoo.

278
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,410
<8-3,Emily>谢谢  这是《圣诞夜惊魂》里的萨利
<8-3,Emily>Oh, thanks, it's Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.

279
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,110
<8-4,Bernadette>那部电影很有趣
<8-4,Bernadette>Aw, that movie's so cute.

280
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,140
<8-5,Howard>你喜欢她  是因为你们都是红头发吗
<8-5,Howard>Do you like her because you both have red hair?

281
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,740
<8-6,Emily>不尽然  更多是因为她浑身伤疤
<8-6,Emily>Uh, a little, but more that she's covered in scars

282
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,730
<8-6,Emily>还可以把四肢都拆下来  然后重新缝上
<8-6,Emily>and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.

283
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,630
<8-7,Bernadette>我喜欢《灰姑娘》
<8-7,Bernadette>I like Cinderella.

284
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,560
<8-8,Emily>你知道在《灰姑娘》原书中
<8-8,Emily>Did you know, in the original book,

285
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,540
<8-8,Emily>灰姑娘的姐姐们为了能穿进水晶鞋
<8-8,Emily>the sisters cut off their toes with knives

286
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,800
<8-8,Emily>用刀把脚趾头砍了下来吗
<8-8,Emily>in order to fit in the glass slipper?

287
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,570
<8-9,Bernadette>我喜欢《魔咒歌》
<8-9,Bernadette>I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

289
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,000
<8-10,Raj>斯图尔特和他的女伴来了
<8-10,Raj>Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,250
<8-11,Emily>她真可爱
<8-11,Emily>Oh, she's cute.

291
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,000
<8-12,Howard>我的天啊
<8-12,Howard>Oh, my God.

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,670
<8-13,Bernadette>怎么了
<8-13,Bernadette>What?

293
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,930
<8-14,Howard>那人是珍妮
<8-14,Howard>That's Jeanie.

294
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,220
<8-14,Howard>她就是珍妮吗
<8-14,Howard>That's Jeanie?!

295
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,410
<8-17,Howard>-珍妮是谁  -别说
<8-17,Howard>- Who's Jeanie? - Don't say it.

296
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,130
<8-18,Raj>霍华德以前睡过的那个堂姐
<8-18,Raj>That's Howard's cousin that he had sex with.

297
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,650
<8-19,Howard>她是我的二等堂姐
<8-19,Howard>She is my second cousin.

298
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,790
<8-19,Howard>我们当时只有15岁  我叫你别说
<8-19,Howard>We were 15... I just said, "don't say it."

299
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,930
<8-20,Emily>没关系
<8-20,Emily>No, it's okay.

300
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,600
<8-20,Emily>他很早以前就告诉我了
<8-20,Emily>He told me that story a long time ago.

301
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,520
<8-21,Howard>拉杰
<8-21,Howard>Raj!

302
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
<8-22,Raj>那是我们第一次约会
<8-22,Raj>It was our first date,

303
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,670
<8-22,Raj>突然冷场了
<8-22,Raj>there was an awkward silence.

304
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,720
<8-22,Raj>我总得找话题说啊
<8-22,Raj>What was I supposed to say?

305
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,160
<9-1,Penny>好漂亮啊
<9-1,Penny>Oh, it's beautiful.

306
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,680
<9-2,Leonard>她们俩布置得真漂亮
<9-2,Leonard>Oh, the girls really did a nice job.

307
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,070
<9-3,Penny>我之前虽然不太感兴趣
<9-3,Penny>I know I wasn't into this before,

308
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,050
<9-3,Penny>不过我很高兴能带你来你的第一个舞会
<9-3,Penny>but I'm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.

309
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,040
<9-4,Leonard>你为什么觉得我没参加毕业舞会
<9-4,Leonard>What makes you think I didn't go to my prom?

310
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,960
<9-5,Penny>-我去了  -你带了谁
<9-5,Penny>- I went. - Well, who'd you go with?

311
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,110
<9-6,Leonard>我带的女伴名叫"孤独"
<9-6,Leonard>I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.

312
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,380
<9-8,Leonard>没事啦
<9-8,Leonard>Aw, it's all right.

313
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,860
<9-8,Leonard>我们最后和"丢脸"
<9-8,Leonard>We ended up having a threesome

314
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,690
<9-8,Leonard>来了个"三人大战"
<9-8,Leonard>with her friend humiliation, so...

315
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,240
<9-9,Penny>如果我当时在场  看见你一个人
<9-9,Penny>Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone,

316
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,390
<9-9,Penny>我一定会邀请你跳舞
<9-9,Penny>I would've asked you to dance.

317
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,410
<9-10,Leonard>不  你不会的
<9-10,Leonard>No, you wouldn't have.

318
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,470
<9-11,Penny>你怎么知道
<9-11,Penny>Well, you don't know that.

319
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,150
<9-12,Leonard>那时候我还没发育呢
<9-12,Leonard>It was before my growth spurt.

320
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,700
<9-13,Penny>什么  你现在是发育过了吗
<9-13,Penny>What, that already happened?

321
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,330
<9-14,Leonard>真好笑
<9-14,Leonard>Very funny.

322
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,790
<9-15,Penny>不过你肯定也不会邀请我
<9-15,Penny>Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.

323
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,290
<9-16,Leonard>我肯定会邀请你
<9-16,Leonard>I would have asked you.

324
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,690
<9-16,Leonard>在我脑子里
<9-16,Leonard>In my head.

325
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,670
<9-16,Leonard>在回家的路上
<9-16,Leonard>On the way home.

326
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,640
<9-16,Leonard>大哭的时候邀请你
<9-16,Leonard>While I was having a good cry.

327
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,760
<10-1,Amy>谢尔顿  我能进来吗
<10-1,Amy>Sheldon, can I come in?

328
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,870
<10-2,Sheldon>我觉得还是算了吧
<10-2,Sheldon>I don't think that's a good idea.

329
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,180
<10-3,Amy>为什么
<10-3,Amy>Why not?

330
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,900
<10-4,Sheldon>根据网上的留言板说
<10-4,Sheldon>According to an online message board,

331
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,980
<10-4,Sheldon>我可能是恐慌症犯了
<10-4,Sheldon>I may be having a panic attack.

332
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,490
<10-4,Sheldon>"足球妈妈09"也有同样的症状
<10-4,Sheldon>SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms.

333
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,110
<10-4,Sheldon>不过说实话  她的双胞胎那天的确很不乖
<10-4,Sheldon>But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.

334
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,060
<10-5,Amy>你让我很担心
<10-5,Amy>You're making me worry.

335
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,530
<10-5,Amy>到底怎么回事
<10-5,Amy>What's going on?

336
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,170
<10-6,Sheldon>事情是我们要去参加毕业舞会
<10-6,Sheldon>What's going on is we're about to go to a prom.

337
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,680
<10-6,Sheldon>对我们这样的青年情侣来说
<10-6,Sheldon>And there's a great deal of pressure

338
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,780
<10-6,Sheldon>要做到鲍勃·尤班克斯
<10-6,Sheldon>on young couples like us to engage in

340
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,160
<10-6,Sheldon>说的那样"肆意狂欢"  有很大压力
<10-6,Sheldon>what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.

341
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,200
<10-7,Amy>什么压力
<10-7,Amy>What pressure?

342
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,930
<10-7,Amy>我不过就说了你好帅
<10-7,Amy>All I said was you look handsome.

343
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,900
<10-7,Amy>把门打开好吗
<10-7,Amy>Can you please open the door?

344
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,370
<10-8,Sheldon>不光是这样
<10-8,Sheldon>It's not just that.

345
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,220
<10-8,Sheldon>莱纳德和佩妮也说了这事
<10-8,Sheldon>Leonard and Penny also made comments about it.

346
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,810
<10-8,Sheldon>我又不是瞎子
<10-8,Sheldon>And I'm not blind.

347
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,170
<10-8,Sheldon>我都忍不住多看两眼我的翘臀
<10-8,Sheldon>Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior

348
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,460
<10-8,Sheldon>裹在礼服裤里的样子
<10-8,Sheldon>in these tuxedo pants.

349
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,020
<10-10,Stuart>我跟珍妮相识于你阿姨格拉蒂家
<10-10,Stuart>So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys'.

350
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,490
<10-10,Stuart>她递给我犹太典礼酒
<10-10,Stuart>She passed me the Manischewitz,

351
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,140
<10-10,Stuart>我看了这犹太美女一眼
<10-10,Stuart>I took one look at this punim,

352
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,770
<10-10,Stuart>差点犹太式"喷"到犹太布丁上
<10-10,Stuart>and I almost plotzed on the kugel.

353
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,290
<10-11,Rajj>我谈论印度时也这么烦人吗
<10-11,Rajj>Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?

354
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,600
<10-12,Howard>我妈对此没意见吗
<10-12,Howard>So, my mother's okay with this?

355
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,180
<10-13,Jeannie>你妈干嘛对我和斯图尔特有意见
<10-13,Jeannie>Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?

356
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,390
<10-14,Howard>因为他们之间存在着不恰当的逾越之举
<10-14,Howard>'Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.

357
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,930
<10-15,Jeannie>比咱俩在我爸车里"做"的事还逾越吗
<10-15,Jeannie>Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's Corolla?

358
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,260
<10-16,Raj>真是太"糟糕"了
<10-16,Raj>This is so messed up.

359
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,700
<10-17,Emily>我知道  我看得好开心啊
<10-17,Emily>I know, I'm having the best time.

360
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,900
<10-18,Howard>你今天为什么要来
<10-18,Howard>Why would you even come to this?

361
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,590
<10-18,Howard>你不是知道我也会在场吗
<10-18,Howard>Didn't you know I'd be here?

362
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,530
<10-19,Jeannie>那事都过去多久了  霍华德
<10-19,Jeannie>It was a long time ago, Howard.

363
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,890
<10-20,Stuart>而且你俩是二等堂姐弟  有啥关系
<10-20,Stuart>And you're only second cousins, who cares?

364
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,890
<10-20,Stuart>珍妮与霍华德关系为同房远堂
<10-20,Stuart>也就是外国人眼中二等堂

365
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,360
<10-21,Bernadette>你明知道这事还非要带她来吗
<10-21,Bernadette>So, you knew and you brought her anyway?

366
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,180
<10-22,Stuart>霍德华能上她  我却不能上吗
<10-22,Stuart>Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me?!

367
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,770
<10-23,Howard>没错
<10-23,Howard>Yeah.

368
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,230
<10-24,Bernadette>滚回家和你自己妈妈
<10-24,Bernadette>Yeah, go have weird relationships

369
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,560
<10-24,Bernadette>堂姐玩不伦去吧
<10-24,Bernadette>with your own mother and cousin.

370
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,440
<10-24,Bernadette>这是他的地盘
<10-24,Bernadette>This is his turf.

371
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,930
<10-23,Howard>说得对
<10-23,Howard>Yeah.

372
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,600
<11-1,Penny>我当年可能不会邀请你跳舞
<11-1,Penny>Well, I might not have asked you to dance then,

373
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,460
<11-1,Penny>-但让我现在邀请你吧  -可是没音乐啊
<11-1,Penny>- but I will ask you now. - There's no music.

374
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,430
<11-2,Leonard>我不管
<11-2,Leonard>I don't care.

375
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,060
<11-3,Penny>咱们自己制造音乐嘛
<11-3,Penny>We'll make our own music.

376
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,140
<11-4,Leonard>瞧瞧  现在谁像个傻瓜啊
<11-4,Leonard>My God, who's the dork now?

377
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,200
<11-4,Leonard>谢谢你穿了平跟鞋
<11-4,Leonard>Thank you for wearing your flats.

378
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,890
<11-5,Penny>谢谢你穿了高跟鞋
<11-5,Penny>Thank you for wearing your heels.

379
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,810
<11-6,Leonard>看我多有出息
<11-6,Leonard>Look at me.

380
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,030
<11-6,Leonard>和舞会中最美的姑娘一起跳舞
<11-6,Leonard>Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.

381
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,890
<11-7,Penny>想不想拍张合影发给
<11-7,Penny>Want to take a picture of us and send it

382
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,150
<11-7,Penny>你国际象棋俱乐部的朋友啊
<11-7,Penny>to your old friends in the chess club?

383
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,910
<11-8,Leonard>我几年前就把你的泳装照发给他们了
<11-8,Leonard>I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago.

384
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,120
<11-8,Leonard>这样真好
<11-8,Leonard>This is nice.

385
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,840
<11-8,Leonard>我都有点希望其他人不来了
<11-8,Leonard>I kind of wish no one else was coming.

386
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,110
<11-9,Penny>我也这么想
<11-9,Penny>I know, me, too.

387
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,300
<11-9,Penny>但能过个不混乱的毕业舞会也不错
<11-9,Penny>But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.

388
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,760
<12-1,Bernadette>华仔  放开他
<12-1,Bernadette>Howie, get off of him!

389
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,520
<12-2,Howard>除非这只猪不再专拱我家的白菜
<12-2,Howard>Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree!

390
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,510
<12-2,Howard>谢尔顿  你太傻了
<12-2,Howard>Sheldon, this is silly.

391
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,050
<12-2,Howard>我不要又错过一次舞会
<12-2,Howard>I'm not missing another prom.

392
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,250
<13-1,Amy>我要上楼去了
<13-1,Amy>I'm going upstairs now.

393
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,670
<13-1,Amy>回见
<13-1,Amy>Good-bye.

394
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,250
<13-2,Sheldon>我真心觉得你今天很美
<13-2,Sheldon>I really did think you looked pretty.

395
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,920
<13-3,Amy>真的吗
<13-3,Amy>You did?

396
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,290
<13-3,Amy>真的
<13-3,Amy>Yes.

397
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,800
<13-4,Sheldon>惊艳到让我开始恐慌
<13-4,Sheldon>So much so that I started to panic.

398
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,630
<13-5,Amy>你不用紧张
<13-5,Amy>Well, you can relax.

399
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,280
<13-5,Amy>就算你觉得我很美
<13-5,Amy>Just because you think I look pretty

400
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,040
<13-5,Amy>也不代表我们今晚就要在一起
<13-5,Amy>doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.

401
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,230
<13-6,Sheldon>可这是舞会  你不就想这样吗
<13-6,Sheldon>Were you hoping we would because it's prom?

402
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,540
<13-7,Amy>我一直都想
<13-7,Amy>I'm always hoping.

403
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,610
<13-7,Amy>但今晚我只想好好和你享受舞会
<13-7,Amy>But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you.

404
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,700
<13-7,Amy>或许还能跟有手臂的生物跳舞
<13-7,Amy>And maybe dance with someone who has arms.

405
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,950
<13-8,Sheldon>谢谢你理解我
<13-8,Sheldon>Thank you for understanding.

406
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,220
<13-9,Amy>我当然理解
<13-9,Amy>Of course I understand.

407
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,730
<13-9,Amy>谢尔顿
<13-9,Amy>Sheldon,

408
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,860
<13-9,Amy>有些话我一直想告诉你
<13-9,Amy>there's something else I've been wanting to say,

409
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,580
<13-9,Amy>在说之前  我...
<13-9,Amy>but before I do, I just...

410
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,320
<13-9,Amy>我想让你明白  你不用回复我
<13-9,Amy>I want you to know that you don't have to say it back.

411
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,580
<13-9,Amy>我知道你还没准备好
<13-9,Amy>I know you're not ready,

412
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,500
<13-9,Amy>所以我不希望你
<13-9,Amy>and I don't want you to say it

413
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,360
<13-9,Amy>仅仅因为社交规矩而说出来
<13-9,Amy>just because social convention dictates...

414
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,110
<13-10,Sheldon>我也爱你
<13-10,Sheldon>I love you, too.

415
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,300
<13-11,Amy>你说出来了
<13-11,Amy>You said it.

416
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,630
<13-12,Sheldon>我对你有着不可否认
<13-12,Sheldon>There's no denying I have feelings for you

417
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,220
<13-12,Sheldon>又无法用其他途径解释的好感
<13-12,Sheldon>that can't be explained in any other way.

418
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,040
<13-12,Sheldon>我曾以为自己脑子里长了寄生虫
<13-12,Sheldon>I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite.

419
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,690
<13-12,Sheldon>但那个理由更牵强
<13-12,Sheldon>But that seems even more farfetched.

420
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,520
<13-12,Sheldon>唯一的结论  这就是爱
<13-12,Sheldon>The only conclusion was love.

421
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,420
<13-12,Sheldon>我知道你怎么了
<13-12,Sheldon>I know what's happening.

422
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,630
<13-12,Sheldon>你这是恐慌发作
<13-12,Sheldon>This is a panic attack.

423
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,300
<13-12,Sheldon>"足球妈妈09"说要双腿抬高马上躺下
<13-12,Sheldon>SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.

424
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,680
<13-13,Amy>好的
<13-13,Amy>Okay.

425
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,640
<13-14,Sheldon>虽然我说了我爱你
<13-14,Sheldon>Just because I love you doesn't mean

426
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,950
<13-14,Sheldon>但不代表女生可以进我房间啊
<13-14,Sheldon>girls are allowed in my room.

427
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,120
<13-14,Sheldon>好了
<13-14,Sheldon>Okay.

428
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,300
<14-1,Raj>照相啦
<14-1,Raj>Here we go...

429
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
<14-1,Raj>说"茄子"
<14-1,Raj>Say "Cheese"!

430
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,040
<14-1,Raj>说"田七"
<14-1,Raj>Say "Cheese"!

431
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,080
<14-1,Raj>说"堂姐"
<14-1,Raj>Say "Cousin"!

432
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,210
<14-1,Raj>说
<14-1,Raj>Say...

433
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,110
<14-2,Stuart>抱歉
<14-2,Stuart>Oh, sorry.

434
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,050
<14-2,Stuart>等一下  抱歉
<14-2,Stuart>Hang on, sorry.

435
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,560
<14-2,Stuart>黛比
<14-2,Stuart>Hey, Debbie.

436
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,480
<14-2,Stuart>我...是的  我和珍妮在一起
<14-2,Stuart>I... Yeah, yeah, I'm here with Jeanie.

437
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,290
<14-2,Stuart>可我和她只是朋友
<14-2,Stuart>Okay, but we're just friends.

438
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,400
<14-2,Stuart>只是...  好吧
<14-2,Stuart>It's... Yeah.

439
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,680
<14-2,Stuart>我得赶紧走了
<14-2,Stuart>I got to go.
