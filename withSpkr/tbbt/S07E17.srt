1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,860
<1-2,Bernadette>拉杰 衣服标签跑出来了
<1-2,Bernadette>Raj, your tag is sticking out.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,710
<1-3,Raj>谢谢  这是我大概两年来
<1-3,Raj>Thank you. That was the closest I've come to sex

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,000
<1-3,Raj>离做爱最接近的一次了
<1-3,Raj>in, like, two years.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,000
<1-4,Bernadette>现在我觉得有点恶心了
<1-4,Bernadette>Now I feel a little gross.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,440
<1-5,Raj>你这话更让我觉得像做爱了
<1-5,Raj>You're only making it seem more real for me.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,940
<1-6,Howard>那是我老婆好吗
<1-6,Howard>Hey, that's my wife.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,110
<1-6,Howard>如果有人让她觉得做爱很恶心  那也只能是我
<1-6,Howard>If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,890
<1-7,Raj>我们能聊点除了
<1-7,Raj>Can we please talk about something

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,520
<1-7,Raj>我悲催的情场之外的事情吗
<1-7,Raj>other than my depressing love life?

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,240
<1-8,Sheldon>那聊聊佩妮悲催的演艺事业吧
<1-8,Sheldon>How about Penny's depressing acting career?

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,930
<1-9,Leonard>现在是有些不顺遂
<1-9,Leonard>I mean, it's been a little tough,

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,450
<1-9,Leonard>但佩妮是在勇敢追梦
<1-9,Leonard>but Penny's following her dreams,

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,590
<1-9,Leonard>在我心中的小本子里  那才不悲催
<1-9,Leonard>and in my book, that is not depressing.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,130
<1-10,Penny>谢谢支持
<1-10,Penny>Aw... Thank you.

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,350
<1-11,Howard>你的小本子书名是《撒谎骗炮大全》吗
<1-11,Howard>Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,060
<1-12,Raj>这书是真的吗
<1-12,Raj>Is that a real book?

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,130
<1-12,Raj>如果真有  我一定拜读啊
<1-12,Raj>I would totally read that book.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,850
<1-13,Amy>等你看完能借我也读读吗
<1-13,Amy>Can I borrow it when you're done?

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,400
<1-14,Penny>姐就跟你们分享一下
<1-14,Penny>Well, I'll have you guys know

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,580
<1-14,Penny>其实我上周才推掉一部戏约
<1-14,Penny>I turned down a part in a movie last week.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,680
<1-15,Leonard>你为什么要推掉
<1-15,Leonard>Why would you do that?

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,790
<1-16,Penny>因为那角色太狗屎了
<1-16,Penny>Because it was crap.

23
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,940
<1-16,Penny>是我以前演过的
<1-16,Penny>It's a sequel to that awful

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,030
<1-16,Penny>杀手猩猩电影的续集
<1-16,Penny>killer gorilla movie I was in.

26
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,260
<1-17,Bernadette>《杀人恶猿》吗
<1-17,Bernadette>Serial Ape-ist?

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
<1-17,Bernadette>你不是在电影里被砍死了吗
<1-17,Bernadette>I thought you died in that.

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,370
<1-18,Sheldon>的确
<1-18,Sheldon>She does.

29
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,600
<1-18,Sheldon>在电影的42分钟
<1-18,Sheldon>42 minutes in.

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,950
<1-19,Raj>当时她正裸身淋浴
<1-19,Raj>while showering topless,

31
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,540
<1-19,Raj>就是跟其他学生会女生打完枕头仗
<1-19,Raj>16 minutes after brief side butt

32
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,660
<1-19,Raj>还小露了一下侧屁的16分钟后被杀
<1-19,Raj>during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.

33
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,310
<1-20,Sheldon>我有过目不忘的记忆力
<1-20,Sheldon>I have an eidetic memory.

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,650
<1-20,Sheldon>但他忘吃什么药我就不知道了
<1-20,Sheldon>I don't know what his problem is.

35
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,190
<1-21,Penny>这集里没有淋浴戏
<1-21,Penny>Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one.

36
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,880
<1-21,Penny>他们试图从我遗体中克隆出新的我
<1-21,Penny>They just try to clone me from my corpse,

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,890
<1-21,Penny>但我的基因跟杀人猩的基因混到了
<1-21,Penny>but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA

38
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,860
<1-21,Penny>所以我得用猩猩的巨手巨脚到处跑
<1-21,Penny>and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.

39
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,230
<1-22,Sheldon>是我漏掉什么点了吗
<1-22,Sheldon>Am I missing something,

40
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,920
<1-22,Sheldon>这角色不就是完全为她而设的吗
<1-22,Sheldon>or isn't that the part she was born to play?

46
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,710
<1-22,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-22,Sheldon>第七季  第十七集

47
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,230
<2-1,Leonard>你真的不去演这电影吗
<2-1,Leonard>So are you really not gonna do this movie?

48
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,620
<2-2,Penny>我觉得这个角色对我的演艺生涯
<2-2,Penny>Well, I don't think it's the kind of part

49
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,490
<2-2,Penny>没有丝毫帮助
<2-2,Penny>that's good for my career.

50
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,620
<2-3,Leonard>可是很多知名演员刚出道时
<2-3,Leonard>Well, but don't a lot of famous actors

51
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,750
<2-3,Leonard>不都是从垃圾电影开始演的吗
<2-3,Leonard>get their start doing bad movies?

52
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,280
<2-4,Penny>但梅丽尔·斯特里普应该没碰到过
<2-4,Penny>Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say...

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,460
<2-4,Penny>"得制止这双猩猩手再去杀人"的电影吧
<2-4,Penny>"must keep gorilla hands from killing again!"

55
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,940
<2-5,Raj>如果她真演了  一定也很赞
<2-5,Raj>If she did, it would be amazing.

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,390
<2-5,Raj>这女人真是演什么像什么
<2-5,Raj>That woman can do no wrong.

57
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,460
<2-6,Leonard>我对演艺界完全不了解
<2-6,Leonard>I-I don't know anything about show business,

58
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,020
<2-6,Leonard>所以如果你觉得推掉有酬工作
<2-6,Leonard>so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work

59
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,430
<2-6,Leonard>继续花光自己的积蓄是正确的
<2-6,Leonard>and just burn through your savings,

60
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,060
<2-6,Leonard>我绝对相信你脑子没抽风
<2-6,Leonard>I'm sure you know what you're doing.

61
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,890
<2-7,Amy>我觉得我们该走了
<2-7,Amy>I think we're gonna go.

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,930
<2-8,Sheldon>你确定吗
<2-8,Sheldon>Are you sure?

63
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,480
<2-8,Sheldon>我们不是在取笑别人失败的事业吗
<2-8,Sheldon>We were making fun of failed careers.

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,130
<2-8,Sheldon>都还没聊到真正的大笑点霍华德身上呢
<2-8,Sheldon>We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.

65
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,030
<2-9,Howard>我跟你不是在同一间大学工作吗
<2-9,Howard>Hey, I work at the same university you do.

66
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,490
<2-10,Sheldon>是  但就像鹰眼侠也在复仇者联盟中
<2-10,Sheldon>Yes, and Hawkeye's in the avengers,

67
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,020
<2-10,Sheldon>你有听过人喊"救命啊  鹰眼侠"吗
<2-10,Sheldon>but no one ever says, "Help, Hawkeye!"

68
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,390
<2-11,Bernadette>我能问你个问题吗
<2-11,Bernadette>Can I ask you something?

69
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,280
<2-11,Bernadette>为什么你总是要吐槽贬低我老公啊
<2-11,Bernadette>Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,040
<2-12,Penny>他一定是吐槽出于情  贬低更是爱吧
<2-12,Penny>Oh, I'm sure he does it out of love.

71
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,170
<2-12,Penny>我男朋友不也这么对我  好让我对
<2-12,Penny>The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible

72
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,510
<2-12,Penny>我做的人生决定感到难受吗
<2-12,Penny>about my life choices.

73
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,150
<2-13,Amy>我们真的要走了
<2-13,Amy>I think we're gonna go.

74
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,660
<2-14,Leonard>不用不用  这不是吵架
<2-14,Leonard>No, no, no. This is not a fight.

75
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,730
<2-14,Leonard>我们只是本来很高兴有人给你戏约嘛
<2-14,Leonard>I-I was just excited that someone offered you a part

76
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,450
<2-14,Leonard>但后来有点惊讶你居然
<2-14,Leonard>and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home

77
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,910
<2-14,Leonard>宁愿在家闲着  也不愿意去演
<2-14,Leonard>and do nothing than take it.

78
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,410
<2-14,Leonard>现在是吵架了
<2-14,Leonard>Now it's a fight.

79
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,970
<2-15,Sheldon>他们那边说清楚了
<2-15,Sheldon>Well, with that sorted out,

80
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,930
<2-15,Sheldon>我也很乐意来回答你的问题  伯纳黛特
<2-15,Sheldon>I'm happy to answer your question, Bernadette.

81
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,580
<2-15,Sheldon>是霍华德先开始的
<2-15,Sheldon>Howard started it.

82
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,010
<2-16,Howard>我什么都没干好吗  我就坐着而已
<2-16,Howard>I didn't do anything. I was just sitting here.

83
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,640
<2-17,Sheldon>我不是指今晚
<2-17,Sheldon>I wasn't referring to this evening.

84
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,030
<2-17,Sheldon>10年前  我与他初次相见时
<2-17,Sheldon>Ten years ago, upon first seeing me,

85
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,510
<2-17,Sheldon>你老公说我长得像《星球大战》里的C-3PO
<2-17,Sheldon>your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO

87
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,340
<2-17,Sheldon>与皮·威·赫尔曼
<2-17,Sheldon>and Pee-wee Herman.

88
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,340
<2-17,Sheldon>上世纪80年代的喜剧电视  电影角色
<2-17,Sheldon>与谢尔顿外形有些神似

89
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,900
<2-17,Sheldon>而且他还叫我C-3P威赫尔曼
<2-17,Sheldon>And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,280
<2-18,Raj>10年后还是很好笑
<2-18,Raj>Still funny.

91
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,100
<2-19,Bernadette>那都是10年前了
<2-19,Bernadette>That was ten years ago.

92
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,620
<2-20,Sheldon>在9年11个月又3周前
<2-20,Sheldon>Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago,

93
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,760
<2-20,Sheldon>他随后又偷偷换掉了我教课的幻灯片
<2-20,Sheldon>he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture

94
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,420
<2-20,Sheldon>改成了一张裸身肥女人弯腰露屁股的照片
<2-20,Sheldon>with photographs of nude fat women bending over.

95
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,070
<2-21,Amy>你不是吧
<2-21,Amy>Really?

96
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,510
<2-22,Howard>他那堂课在教宇宙的气体云嘛
<2-22,Howard>The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds.

97
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,410
<2-22,Howard>胖子放屁成宇宙云  超好笑
<2-22,Howard>That's funny!

98
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,480
<2-23,Raj>当时我在  真的超好笑
<2-23,Raj>I was there. It was funny.

99
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,140
<2-24,Sheldon>而在那之后  他开始了长达10年的
<2-24,Sheldon>In any event, that began a decade-long progression

100
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,210
<2-24,Sheldon>各种羞辱  恶整  还给我订各种奇怪杂志
<2-24,Sheldon>of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions.

101
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,140
<2-24,Sheldon>一直到现在  我还每个月都收到
<2-24,Sheldon>To this day, I still get a monthly copy

102
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,490
<2-24,Sheldon>《老奶奶床战老奶奶》
<2-24,Sheldon>of Granny on Granny.

103
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,800
<2-24,Sheldon>除了出乎意料好玩的智力游戏页面之外
<2-24,Sheldon>Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page,

104
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,660
<2-24,Sheldon>整本都龌龊不堪
<2-24,Sheldon>is complete filth.

105
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,090
<3-1,Amy>谢谢你陪走到停车位那
<3-1,Amy>Thanks for walking me to my car.

106
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,090
<3-2,Raj>其实我也想谢谢你
<3-2,Raj>Actually, it's for both of us.

107
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,630
<3-2,Raj>昨晚我看了电影《西区故事》
<3-2,Raj>Last night, I watched West Side Story,

109
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,220
<3-2,Raj>现在有点害怕街头帮派
<3-2,Raj>and I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.

110
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,060
<3-3,Amy>为什么拉杰找不到女友
<3-3,Amy>Why can't Raj find a girl?

111
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,500
<3-3,Amy>看来这问题找不到答案啦
<3-3,Amy>The mystery continues.

112
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,030
<3-4,Raj>虽然我不喜欢你挖苦我
<3-4,Raj>I don't appreciate your sarcasm,

113
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,140
<3-4,Raj>但还有两个街区  所以我唯有忍忍了
<3-4,Raj>but we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.

114
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,750
<3-5,Amy>你网上交友进行得如何
<3-5,Amy>Whatever happened with your online dating?

115
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,310
<3-6,Raj>没人回复我  所以我也懒得登上去看了
<3-6,Raj>No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.

116
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,820
<3-7,Amy>在遇见谢尔顿前  我也准备要放弃
<3-7,Amy>Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too.

117
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,890
<3-7,Amy>我还曾去拜访过我的妇产科医生
<3-7,Amy>Once, I even dropped in on my OB/GYN

118
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,130
<3-7,Amy>只为寻求跟人类有肉体接触的机会
<3-7,Amy>just to get some human contact.

119
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,210
<3-8,Raj>貌似我的前列腺也好久没检查了
<3-8,Raj>It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.

120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,490
<3-9,Amy>然后我遇见了谢尔顿  你看我们现在进展多快
<3-9,Amy>Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.

121
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,020
<3-10,Raj>有吗  你们交往三年才接过一次吻
<3-10,Raj>What? You've kissed, like, once in three years.

122
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,630
<3-11,Amy>那倒是  你爱干嘛干嘛吧
<3-11,Amy>That's true. Do whatever you want.

123
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,880
<4-2,Sheldon>你好
<4-2,Sheldon>Hello.

124
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,420
<4-3,Howard>我一直在想  或许你和我
<4-3,Howard>Listen, I was thinking you and I could

125
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,590
<4-3,Howard>可以试着成为更好的朋友
<4-3,Howard>probably try to be better friends.

126
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,670
<4-3,Howard>是吗
<4-3,Howard>Really?

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,710
<4-4,Sheldon>我觉得我们现在就好得有点过分了
<4-4,Sheldon>I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.

128
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,600
<4-5,Howard>说真的  我昨晚和伯纳黛特谈过了
<4-5,Howard>Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and...

129
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,990
<4-5,Howard>她说得很有道理
<4-5,Howard>she made some great points.

130
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,110
<4-5,Howard>我们都认识彼此这么长时间了
<4-5,Howard>You and I have known each other a long time,

131
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,980
<4-5,Howard>后面的我没听进去  因为她把胸罩脱掉了
<4-5,Howard>and I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.

132
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,440
<4-6,Sheldon>很好
<4-6,Sheldon>Very well.

133
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,070
<4-6,Sheldon>那你觉得我们应该如何增进友谊
<4-6,Sheldon>How do you propose we move forward?

134
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,300
<4-7,Howard>首先我们可以停止羞辱对方
<4-7,Howard>Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.

135
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,900
<4-8,Sheldon>这个主意真棒
<4-8,Sheldon>That's a great idea.

136
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,880
<4-8,Sheldon>本着我们休战新协议的友好精神
<4-8,Sheldon>And in the spirit of our new arrangement,

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,850
<4-8,Sheldon>我会掩饰我对你想出这主意的惊讶之情
<4-8,Sheldon>I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.

138
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,040
<4-9,Howard>总之  这周末太空总署邀请我去休斯顿
<4-9,Howard>Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA

139
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,420
<4-9,Howard>做一个小演讲
<4-9,Howard>in Houston this weekend.

140
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,990
<4-9,Howard>他们给我提供了两张机票  但伯纳黛特去不了
<4-9,Howard>They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can't go.

141
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,310
<4-9,Howard>你想跟我一起去吗
<4-9,Howard>You want to come with me?

142
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,550
<4-9,Howard>你可以顺便去看看你妈
<4-9,Howard>You can visit your mom,

143
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,490
<4-9,Howard>我也可以带你参观太空中心
<4-9,Howard>and I'll show you around the space center.

144
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,540
<4-10,Sheldon>我有个问题
<4-10,Sheldon>I have one question.

145
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,170
<4-10,Sheldon>这是个恶作剧吗
<4-10,Sheldon>Is this a prank...

146
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,030
<4-10,Sheldon>会不会我们一到达休斯顿
<4-10,Sheldon>where we land in Houston

147
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,820
<4-10,Sheldon>那里会张贴着你做好的通缉令
<4-10,Sheldon>and you've made up wanted posters

148
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,780
<4-10,Sheldon>上面是我长着小胡子的照片  和一个西班牙名
<4-10,Sheldon>that have my face with a mustache and a Spanish name

149
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,320
<4-10,Sheldon>于是我会被逮捕并被遣送回南美洲
<4-10,Sheldon>and then I get arrested and deported to South America?

150
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,580
<4-11,Howard>不会
<4-11,Howard>No.

151
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,600
<4-12,Sheldon>那我就放心了  因为我肯定料不到你会这么玩
<4-12,Sheldon>I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.

152
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,600
<5-1,Raj>艾米  我想请你帮忙
<5-1,Raj>Amy, I could use some help.

153
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,000
<5-2,Amy>我猜猜  是不是有位
<5-2,Amy>Oh. Let me guess. There's an...

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,470
<5-2,Amy>穿着皮衣的男大学生
<5-2,Amy>undergrad in a leather jacket

155
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,190
<5-2,Amy>在饮水机那里打着响指[西区故事中的混混]
<5-2,Amy>snapping his fingers by the water fountain.

156
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,680
<5-3,Raj>我认真想过你昨晚说的话
<5-3,Raj>I thought about what you said last night,

157
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
<5-3,Raj>于是我再次登上交友网站
<5-3,Raj>and I went back on the dating Web site

158
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,970
<5-3,Raj>我看见了这个女生的个人资料
<5-3,Raj>and I was looking at this girl's profile.

159
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,340
<5-3,Raj>她太完美了
<5-3,Raj>She's amazing.

160
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,670
<5-4,Amy>她长得不错
<5-4,Amy>Oh, she's cute.

161
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,710
<5-4,Amy>还很聪明  美国大学优等生荣誉学会会员
<5-4,Amy>And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.

162
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,240
<5-5,Raj>从她没有喉结这点可以判断出
<5-5,Raj>And judging by her lack of Adam's apple,

163
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,000
<5-5,Raj>她这辈子一直都是女人
<5-5,Raj>she's been female her entire life.

164
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,940
<5-5,Raj>我喜欢女人这一点
<5-5,Raj>I like that in a woman.

165
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,500
<5-6,Amy>很好  你需要我帮什么忙
<5-6,Amy>Great, so what do you need me for?

166
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,310
<5-7,Raj>我一晚没睡给她写了一封信
<5-7,Raj>Well, I was up all night trying to write to her,

167
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,170
<5-7,Raj>我想先听听你的意见
<5-7,Raj>but I wanted to run it by you first.

168
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,570
<5-8,Amy>好的
<5-8,Amy>All right.

169
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,450
<5-8,Amy>"艾米丽
<5-8,Amy>"Emily,

170
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,950
<5-9,Raj>你的脸颊就像被露珠吻过的花朵那么娇嫩"
<5-9,Raj>your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower..."

171
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,230
<5-11,Raj>我知道  很有震撼力吧
<5-11,Raj>I know. Powerful stuff, huh?

172
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,380
<5-11,Raj>不对啦
<5-11,Raj>No.

173
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,960
<5-12,Amy>你应该做自己  而不是像个
<5-12,Amy>You're supposed to be yourself, not all...

174
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,230
<5-12,Amy>饥渴又吓人的变态
<5-12,Amy>desperate and creepy.

175
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,410
<5-13,Raj>我就是那样的变态啊  那到底还要不要做自己
<5-13,Raj>Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.

176
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,490
<5-14,Amy>就写一些普通的东西  比如"我看了你的资料
<5-14,Amy>Just say something normal like, "I saw your profile.

177
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,620
<5-14,Amy>似乎咱俩有很多共同之处
<5-14,Amy>Looks like we have a lot in common;

178
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,050
<5-14,Amy>-有空一起去喝杯咖啡吧"  -对
<5-14,Amy>- let's get a cup of coffee sometime."  - Yes.

179
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,870
<5-15,Raj>"喝咖啡时  我会嫉妒咖啡杯
<5-15,Raj>"Where I can be jealous of the cup

180
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,800
<5-15,Raj>它能碰触你红宝石般的双唇"
<5-15,Raj>touching your ruby lips."

181
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,060
<5-15,Raj>或者干脆你帮我写吧
<5-15,Raj>Or you just write it for me.

182
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,590
<5-16,Amy>我才不要假扮你呢
<5-16,Amy>I'm not gonna pretend to be you.

183
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,170
<5-17,Raj>我不是要你假扮我
<5-17,Raj>I don't want you to pretend to be me.

184
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,420
<5-17,Raj>你可以当我的网络泡妞搭档
<5-17,Raj>You can be like my, uh, online wingman.

185
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,270
<5-17,Raj>好比如果我们是在酒吧遇到她  你就在一旁使劲夸我
<5-17,Raj>Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.

186
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,280
<5-18,Amy>那我应该跟她说什么
<5-18,Amy>Well, what would I say to her?

187
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,840
<5-19,Raj>告诉她我是个什么样的人
<5-19,Raj>Just tell her what I'm really like.

188
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,550
<5-19,Raj>如果你觉得有帮助的话
<5-19,Raj>And, if you think it'll help,

189
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,850
<5-19,Raj>可以说你曾见过我换衣服
<5-19,Raj>that you saw me changing once

190
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,170
<5-19,Raj>我的鸡鸡让你想到美洲虎肌肉发达的尾巴
<5-19,Raj>and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar.

191
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,210
<5-19,Raj>用你自己的话去表达吧
<5-19,Raj>Use your own words.

192
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,200
<6-1,Sheldon>谢谢你载我去药房
<6-1,Sheldon>Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.

193
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,310
<6-2,Penny>别客气  你还好吗
<6-2,Penny>Oh, it's no problem. Is everything okay?

194
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,970
<6-3,Sheldon>我没事  这只是
<6-3,Sheldon>Oh, I'm fine. It's just some, uh,

195
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,270
<6-3,Sheldon>为我的旅行准备的胃药
<6-3,Sheldon>stomach medication for my trip.

196
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,230
<6-3,Sheldon>虽然可能性极小 但不排除
<6-3,Sheldon>There's the remote yet distinct possibility

197
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,650
<6-3,Sheldon>我可能会沦落到南美洲
<6-3,Sheldon>that I may end up in South America.

198
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,010
<6-4,Penny>还记得以前我会问你一些蠢问题吗
<6-4,Penny>Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb

199
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,230
<6-4,Penny>比如像"为什么"
<6-4,Penny>like "why?"

200
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,100
<6-4,Penny>这声音听起来不妙
<6-4,Penny>Uh, that doesn't sound good.

201
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,480
<6-5,Sheldon>还记得以前我会指出你上车后
<6-5,Sheldon>Remember the old days when I used to point out

202
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,370
<6-5,Sheldon>应该检查发动机警示灯是否亮着吗
<6-5,Sheldon>that your check engine light was on?

203
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,390
<6-7,Sheldon>-记得  -少女  准备重温旧梦吧
<6-7,Sheldon>- Yes. - Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane:

204
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,480
<6-7,Sheldon>佩妮  你检查发动机...
<6-7,Sheldon>Penny, your check engine...

205
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,740
<6-8,Penny>我知道灯是亮着的  谢尔顿
<6-8,Penny>Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon!

206
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,080
<6-8,Penny>别别别  不要啊
<6-8,Penny>Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

207
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,490
<6-8,Penny>我现在可付不起修车费
<6-8,Penny>I cannot afford this right now.

208
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,770
<6-9,Sheldon>或许只是小问题而已
<6-9,Sheldon>Maybe it's just something minor.

209
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,320
<6-9,Sheldon>好消息是那警示灯灭了
<6-9,Sheldon>Ooh, good news, the light just went out.

210
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,000
<7-1,Leonard>我们是各玩各的还是组队玩
<7-1,Leonard>Are we playing individual or teams?

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
<7-2,Raj>组队有意思
<7-2,Raj>Teams are fun.

212
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,470
<7-3,Sheldon>这样的话  那我希望和我的好朋友
<7-3,Sheldon>Oh, in that case, I'd like to be partnered

213
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,740
<7-3,Sheldon>霍华德组队
<7-3,Sheldon>with my good friend Howard.

214
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,870
<7-4,Raj>可霍华德从来都跟我组队
<7-4,Raj>But I'm always on Howard's team.

215
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,400
<7-4,Raj>我们才是最好的朋友
<7-4,Raj>We're best friends.

216
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,560
<7-4,Raj>那种默契好到能完成对方的句...
<7-4,Raj>The kind who finish each others...

217
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,990
<7-5,Howard>-我不觉得我们有做这..  -这种事  你看
<7-5,Howard>- I really don't think we do tha... - ...do that! See?

218
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,850
<7-8,Leonard>修车行怎么说
<7-8,Leonard>Oh, how'd it go at the mechanic?

219
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,440
<7-9,Penny>不太妙  能借一步说话吗
<7-9,Penny>Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?

220
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,000
<7-10,Leonard>好啊
<7-10,Leonard>Yeah, sure.

221
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,890
<7-11,Raj>我能跟你们一起去休斯顿吗
<7-11,Raj>Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?

222
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,140
<7-12,Howard>现在买机票是不是有点...
<7-12,Howard>Isn't it a little late to get plane tick...

223
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,350
<7-13,Raj>...有点晚吗  没错
<7-13,Raj>...plane tickets? Yeah.

224
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,360
<7-14,Howard>求求你别再闹...
<7-14,Howard>Will you please sto...

225
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,630
<7-15,Raj>...别再闹了  好的
<7-15,Raj>...stop that? Okay.

226
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,450
<7-15,Raj>我真不知道该如何是好
<7-15,Raj>I don't know what to do.

227
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,900
<8-1,Penny>我的车坏了  彻底报废了
<8-1,Penny>My car threw a rod and it's totaled.

228
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,580
<8-1,Penny>可我工作也没了  又买不起新车
<8-1,Penny>I can't afford a new one, I have no job,

229
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,190
<8-1,Penny>现在我连试镜都没办法去
<8-1,Penny>and now I can't drive to auditions.

230
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,790
<8-2,Leonard>真遗憾
<8-2,Leonard>I'm so sorry.

231
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,700
<8-2,Leonard>我知道这件事你不爱听
<8-2,Leonard>I know it's a sensitive subject,

232
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,020
<8-2,Leonard>可你能重新考虑一下那个电影角色吗
<8-2,Leonard>but can you reconsider that part in the movie?

233
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,400
<8-3,Penny>我考虑了  我打了电话  人家不要我了
<8-3,Penny>I did. I called them. The part's gone.

234
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,150
<8-3,Penny>那个角色已经被别人抢走了
<8-3,Penny>They gave it to someone else.

235
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,340
<8-3,Penny>现在那姑娘马上就要一夜成名
<8-3,Penny>Now that girl's gonna get discovered and become famous

236
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,470
<8-3,Penny>然后去访谈秀大聊特聊她是如何
<8-3,Penny>and go on Letterman and talk about

237
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,650
<8-3,Penny>从一部廉价的猴子电影中一举成名的
<8-3,Penny>how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie

238
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,060
<8-3,Penny>这都多亏了某个傻妞当初不屑去演
<8-3,Penny>all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.

239
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,300
<8-4,Leonard>这样你至少还在访谈秀上被提起了啊
<8-4,Leonard>At least they talked about you on Letterman.

240
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,350
<8-4,Leonard>别这样  你想去哪儿  我都开车载你
<8-4,Leonard>Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.

241
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,230
<8-5,Penny>怎么可能  你和我不一样  你有工作呀
<8-5,Penny>How? Unlike me, you have a job.

242
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,640
<8-5,Penny>我唯有回去当我的服务员
<8-5,Penny>I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress...

243
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,530
<8-5,Penny>这将成为我一辈子的工作
<8-5,Penny>...like I will be for the rest of my life.

244
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,740
<8-6,Sheldon>莱纳德  你麻利一点好不好
<8-6,Sheldon>Leonard, would you wrap it up?

245
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,410
<8-6,Sheldon>我们都在等你呢
<8-6,Sheldon>We're waiting on you.

246
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,430
<8-7,Penny>对不起  是不是我苦难的人生
<8-7,Penny>I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart

247
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,870
<8-7,Penny>打扰到您崇高的桌游了
<8-7,Penny>interfering with your board game?

248
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,880
<8-8,Sheldon>是的
<8-8,Sheldon>It is.

249
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,030
<8-8,Sheldon>你错了  吾友霍华德
<8-8,Sheldon>You were wrong, friend Howard.

250
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,200
<8-8,Sheldon>她完全能理解我们的状况
<8-8,Sheldon>She completely understood.

251
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,130
<9-1,Raj>你现在忙吗
<9-1,Raj>Hey, you busy?

252
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,390
<9-2,Amy>不忙  什么事
<9-2,Amy>No. What's up?

253
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,630
<9-3,Raj>艾米丽回信了吗
<9-3,Raj>Have you heard back from Emily?

254
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,730
<9-4,Amy>回了
<9-4,Amy>I have.

255
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,290
<9-5,Raj>太好了  说什么
<9-5,Raj>Great! And?

256
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,060
<9-6,Amy>恐怕她觉得你俩不合适
<9-6,Amy>And I'm afraid she doesn't think you're right for her.

257
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,530
<9-7,Raj>我给了你一个这么简单的任务
<9-7,Raj>I give you one simple thing to do--

258
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,360
<9-7,Raj>联系一个素未谋面的陌生人
<9-7,Raj>contact a complete stranger

259
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,470
<9-7,Raj>让她爱上我
<9-7,Raj>and make her fall in love with me--

260
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,320
<9-7,Raj>你却连这都办砸了
<9-7,Raj>and you blow it!

261
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,080
<9-8,Amy>我把你的好都告诉她了  可是
<9-8,Amy>I told her what a good guy you are, but

262
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,700
<9-8,Amy>她觉得你不肯亲自给她写信
<9-8,Amy>she thought it was a bad sign

263
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,950
<9-8,Amy>这就不是什么好兆头
<9-8,Amy>that you didn't write to her yourself.

264
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,930
<9-8,Amy>她觉得你显得太害羞  太被动了
<9-8,Amy>She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.

265
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,500
<9-9,Raj>人家才不害羞和被动呢
<9-9,Raj>I'm not too shy and passive.

266
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,400
<9-9,Raj>你马上回信给她   把我的话告诉她
<9-9,Raj>You write her back and tell her I said that.

267
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,540
<9-9,Raj>当然  等你有空的时候
<9-9,Raj>You know, when you have a second.

268
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,050
<9-10,Amy>明晚我会试着改变她的想法
<9-10,Amy>Look, I'll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.

269
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,630
<9-11,Raj>明天晚上有什么事
<9-11,Raj>What's happening tomorrow night?

270
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,340
<9-12,Amy>我要和她出来喝咖啡
<9-12,Amy>I'm meeting her for coffee.

271
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,940
<9-13,Raj>什么
<9-13,Raj>What?!

272
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,860
<9-14,Amy>我们后来发了几次邮件
<9-14,Amy>Well, we just... we e-mailed back and forth a bit,

273
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,210
<9-14,Amy>发现我俩还挺合拍的
<9-14,Amy>and we kind of hit it off.

274
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,420
<9-15,Raj>-我找到了梦中情人  你却要把她抢走  -才不是
<9-15,Raj>- I find a girl I like, and you're stealing her?! - No.

275
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,730
<9-16,Amy>我们只是发现两人有很多共同点
<9-16,Amy>We just ended up having a lot in common.

276
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,630
<9-16,Amy>我们都是哈佛毕业  我们都喜欢乔叟[英国作家]
<9-16,Amy>We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer,

277
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,880
<9-16,Amy>我们都疯狂喜欢缝花被子
<9-16,Amy>we're both hardcore into quilting.

278
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,270
<9-17,Raj>你的一字一句都像是冷冷的酸雨
<9-17,Raj>Your words fall like acid rain

279
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,910
<9-17,Raj>在我破碎的心上胡乱地拍
<9-17,Raj>on the wounded petals of my heart.

280
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,180
<9-17,Raj>是谢尔顿
<9-17,Raj>That's Sheldon.

281
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,620
<10-1,Howard>他说他马上就下来
<10-1,Howard>He says he'll be down in a minute.

282
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,510
<10-2,Bernadette>你在干什么
<10-2,Bernadette>What are you doing?

283
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,910
<10-3,Howard>他不确认你车里没有空气清新剂
<10-3,Howard>Oh, he's not coming out until he sees proof

284
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,780
<10-3,Howard>他就不会出来
<10-3,Howard>you don't have an air freshener in your car.

285
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,670
<10-4,Bernadette>这个周末你肯定度日如年了
<10-4,Bernadette>This is gonna be a long weekend for you.

286
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,560
<10-5,Howard>明明是你要我这么做的
<10-5,Howard>You're the reason I'm doing it!

287
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,480
<10-6,Bernadette>我只是让你们不要再互相攻击了
<10-6,Bernadette>I said to stop insulting each other.

288
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,690
<10-6,Bernadette>又没叫你和他一起共度浪漫周末
<10-6,Bernadette>I didn't tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.

289
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,650
<10-7,Howard>我怎么知道你都说了什么
<10-7,Howard>How do I know what you said?

290
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,050
<10-7,Howard>都怪你和你那对"化言语为无声"的大咪咪
<10-7,Howard>Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.

291
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,600
<10-9,Bernadette>你们好
<10-9,Bernadette>Hello.

292
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,420
<10-10,Howard>-你好啊  -你好
<10-10,Howard>- Hi. - Hey, buddy.

293
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,500
<10-11,Bernadette>要去德克萨斯了  开心吗
<10-11,Bernadette>You excited for Texas?

294
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,290
<10-12,Sheldon>当然开心了
<10-12,Sheldon>Oh, very much so.

295
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,860
<10-13,Howard>能和真正的宇航员去太空总署  千载难逢啊
<10-13,Howard>It's not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.

296
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,960
<10-14,Sheldon>那个真正的宇航员是谁呀
<10-14,Sheldon>Who's the real astronaut?

297
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,800
<10-15,Howard>巴斯·奥尔德林[传奇宇航员]
<10-15,Howard>Buzz Aldrin.

298
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,140
<10-16,Sheldon>太好了
<10-16,Sheldon>Oh. Yay!

299
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,110
<11-1,Sheldon>霍华德
<11-1,Sheldon>Howard?

300
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,390
<11-1,Sheldon>霍华德
<11-1,Sheldon>Howard?

301
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,390
<11-1,Sheldon>霍华德
<11-1,Sheldon>Howard?

302
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,760
<11-2,Howard>又怎么了
<11-2,Howard>What now?

303
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,930
<11-3,Sheldon>我要去上厕所了
<11-3,Sheldon>I have to go to the bathroom.

304
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,980
<11-4,Howard>你不是刚去了吗
<11-4,Howard>You just went to the bathroom.

305
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,330
<11-5,Sheldon>我没上  因为感觉不太安全
<11-5,Sheldon>I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe.

306
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,660
<11-5,Sheldon>尽管我曾多次发邮件  马桶还是没加装安全带
<11-5,Sheldon>Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.

307
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,590
<11-6,Howard>现在也还是没有啊
<11-6,Howard>Well, it still doesn't.

308
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,440
<11-7,Sheldon>我知道  前面贪杯喝苹果汁时
<11-7,Sheldon>I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window

309
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,420
<11-7,Sheldon>就把安全问题抛之脑后了
<11-7,Sheldon>two apple juices ago.

310
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,360
<11-8,Howard>好吧
<11-8,Howard>Fine.

311
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,970
<11-9,Sheldon>你为什么这么心烦
<11-9,Sheldon>Why are you getting annoyed?

312
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,640
<11-10,Howard>我努力当一个更好的朋友
<11-10,Howard>I'm trying to be a better friend,

313
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,870
<11-10,Howard>但你不断说些烦人的话  做些烦人的事
<11-10,Howard>but you constantly say and do irritating things.

314
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,740
<11-11,Sheldon>-什么时候  -什么时候
<11-11,Sheldon>- Like when? - When?!

315
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,690
<11-12,Howard>之前在车里时
<11-12,Howard>How about in the car?

316
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,150
<11-12,Howard>我是宇航员  你知道的
<11-12,Howard>I'm an astronaut, and you know it.

317
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,540
<11-12,Howard>你只是不愿承认  因为你嫉妒
<11-12,Howard>You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.

318
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,570
<11-13,Sheldon>说实话
<11-13,Sheldon>Well, truth be told,

319
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,290
<11-13,Sheldon>我小时候的确梦想过上太空
<11-13,Sheldon>as a child, I did dream of going to space.

320
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,410
<11-13,Sheldon>那些宇航员是我的英雄
<11-13,Sheldon>Those astronauts were my heroes.

321
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,840
<11-13,Sheldon>后来
<11-13,Sheldon>And...

322
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,440
<11-13,Sheldon>你也上太空了  我挺难接受的
<11-13,Sheldon>when you got to go, it was hard for me.

323
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,860
<11-14,Howard>谢谢
<11-14,Howard>Thank you.

324
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,880
<11-15,Sheldon>因为这让我意识到
<11-15,Sheldon>Because it made me realize

325
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,120
<11-15,Sheldon>是个人就能被太空总署送上去
<11-15,Sheldon>they'll just send anyone up there.

326
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,360
<11-15,Sheldon>-你不打算让我出去了吗  -不
<11-15,Sheldon>- Aren't you going to let me out? - No.

327
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,440
<11-17,Sheldon>但我还是需要上洗手间
<11-17,Sheldon>But I still need to use the bathroom.

328
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,660
<11-18,Howard>给你  发挥创意吧
<11-18,Howard>Here you go. Be creative.

329
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,740
<11-18,Howard>怎么啦  害怕小小的乱流吗
<11-18,Howard>What's the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?

330
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,140
<11-19,Sheldon>不害怕  乱流只是大气中
<11-19,Sheldon>No, turbulence is just the equalization

331
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,980
<11-19,Sheldon>昼夜温差的均衡
<11-19,Sheldon>of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere.

332
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,880
<11-19,Sheldon>我一点也不怕
<11-19,Sheldon>I'm not scared at all.

333
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,000
<11-19,Sheldon>苹果汁  别出来啊
<11-19,Sheldon>Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.

334
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,670
<11-20,Howard>这算什么啊
<11-20,Howard>Oh, this is nothing.

335
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,030
<11-20,Howard>我以"假宇航员"身份
<11-20,Howard>I experienced way worse

336
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,890
<11-20,Howard>乘飞船垂直降落重返地球时
<11-20,Howard>when I was plummeting back to Earth,

337
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,260
<11-20,Howard>那滋味才叫一个难受
<11-20,Howard>apparently not being a real astronaut.

338
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,980
<11-20,Howard>好吧  刚才那下挺严重的
<11-20,Howard>Okay, that was a big one.

339
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,100
<11-21,Sheldon>我收回刚才的话  我害怕乱流
<11-21,Sheldon>I take it back. I'm scared of turbulence!

340
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,920
<11-22,Howard>把呕吐袋还给我
<11-22,Howard>I'm gonna need that bag back.

341
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,160
<12-1,Leonard>你确定要这么做吗
<12-1,Leonard>You sure you want to do this?

342
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,340
<12-2,Penny>对  我为什么不想要回原来的工作
<12-2,Penny>Yeah. Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back?

343
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,920
<12-2,Penny>看到大家一定"很有意思"
<12-2,Penny>It'll be fun to see everyone.

344
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,470
<12-2,Penny>我最后一次跟大家说的是
<12-2,Penny>I haven't talked to them since I said,

345
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,760
<12-2,Penny>"姐辞职了  奥斯卡颁奖礼见  贱人们"
<12-2,Penny>"I quit. See you at the Oscars, bitches."

346
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,460
<12-2,Penny>快点  早搞完早收工
<12-2,Penny>Come on, let's just get this over with.

347
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,920
<12-3,Leonard>"早搞完早收工"
<12-3,Leonard>"Let's get this over with."

348
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,580
<12-7,Leonard>我这是要开车送你去芝士工厂
<12-7,Leonard>Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory,

349
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,510
<12-3,Leonard>还是我们要做爱啊
<12-3,Leonard>or are we having sex?

350
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,570
<12-3,Leonard>我只是想逗你乐一下
<12-3,Leonard>I'm just... I'm trying to lighten the mood.

351
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,420
<12-4,Penny>-我知道  谢谢  -抱歉
<12-4,Penny>- I know. Thank you. - Sorry.

352
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,960
<12-6,Penny>真是太丢人了
<12-6,Penny>It's just so humiliating.

353
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,530
<12-6,Penny>太丢人了
<12-6,Penny>So humiliating?

354

<12-7,Leonard>我这是要开车送你去芝士工厂还...
<12-7,Leonard>Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory...?

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,520
<12-7,Leonard>对不起  我不说了  我不说了
<12-7,Leonard>I'm sorry. I'll-I'll stop. I'll stop.

356
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,800
<13-1,Leonard>拜托  别这么伤心
<13-1,Leonard>Come on, don't look so sad.

357
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,880
<13-1,Leonard>你永远不知道未来会发生什么事
<13-1,Leonard>You never know what's gonna happen.

358
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,220
<13-1,Leonard>也许今晚会非常棒
<13-1,Leonard>Maybe tonight will be great.

359
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,940
<13-2,Penny>亲爱的  我知道你在努力安慰我
<13-2,Penny>Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better,

360
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,800
<13-2,Penny>我喜欢你这么体贴
<13-2,Penny>and I love you for that,

361
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,520
<13-2,Penny>但这让我更难受了  而且我有点讨厌你
<13-2,Penny>but it's making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you.

362
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,760
<13-2,Penny>这不是你的车啊
<13-2,Penny>This isn't your car.

363
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,240
<13-3,Leonard>我知道  我想我们开你的车去
<13-3,Leonard>I know. I thought we'd take yours.

364
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,180
<13-4,Penny>我不明白
<13-4,Penny>I don't understand.

365
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,080
<13-5,Leonard>虽然不是豪车  但至少你去试镜能有代步工具
<13-5,Leonard>It's nothing fancy, but it'll get you to auditions,

366
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,750
<13-5,Leonard>至少现在  你不用回去做服务员了
<13-5,Leonard>and at least for now, you don't have to go back to waitressing.

367
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,810
<13-6,Penny>我不知道该说什么
<13-6,Penny>I don't know what to say.

368
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,720
<13-7,Leonard>什么也不用说
<13-7,Leonard>Don't say anything.

369
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,980
<13-8,Penny>我的天
<13-8,Penny>Oh, my God.

370
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,790
<13-9,Leonard>你可以说"谢谢你"
<13-9,Leonard>I mean, you could say, "thank you."

371
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,070
<13-9,Leonard>我的确送了辆车给你
<13-9,Leonard>I did just buy you a car.

372
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,380
<14-1,Amy>我承认拉杰什
<14-1,Amy>Look, I admit that it's odd

373
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,260
<14-1,Amy>不亲自写信给你是有些奇怪
<14-1,Amy>that Rajesh didn't write to you himself,

374
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,510
<14-1,Amy>但如果你了解他
<14-1,Amy>but if you get to know him,

375
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,810
<14-1,Amy>你就会知道他只是个亲切的普通人
<14-1,Amy>you'll see he's just a sweet, regular guy.

376
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,130
<14-1,Amy>作为有趣的对比  他来了
<14-1,Amy>As a counterpoint, here he is,

377
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,510
<14-1,Amy>不速之客兼大汗淋漓
<14-1,Amy>uninvited and visibly sweaty.

378
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,220
<14-2,Raj>-你好  艾米丽  -你好
<14-2,Raj>- Hello, Emily. - Hello.

379
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,570
<14-4,Raj>艾米告诉我你担心我
<14-4,Raj>Amy told me you were concerned that

380
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,250
<14-4,Raj>可能太过被动与害羞
<14-4,Raj>I might be too passive and shy.

381
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,950
<14-4,Raj>我问你个事
<14-4,Raj>Let me ask you something.

382
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,630
<14-4,Raj>一个被动的人会闯进这里
<14-4,Raj>Would a passive guy barge in here

383
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,180
<14-4,Raj>看着你的眼睛说
<14-4,Raj>to look you in the eye and say,

384
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,470
<14-4,Raj>"嘿  露水吻过的鲜花  你好啊"
<14-4,Raj>"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"

385
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,260
<14-5,Emily>不  但没有下限的变态可能会说
<14-5,Emily>No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.

386
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,990
<14-6,Raj>好吧  这是另外的问题
<14-6,Raj>Uh, okay, that's a separate issue.

387
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,770
<14-6,Raj>咱们先把这问题摆一边  专注于"被动"
<14-6,Raj>Let's put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.

388
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,030
<14-7,Emily>我走了
<14-7,Emily>I'm leaving.

389
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,290
<14-8,Amy>我们周五还去乔叟读书会吗
<14-8,Amy>Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?

390
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,770
<14-9,Emily>我想我还是一个人去吧
<14-9,Emily>You know, I think I'm just gonna go by myself.

391
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,540
<14-10,Raj>算不上是我最棒的初次约会
<14-10,Raj>Not my best first date.

392
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,250
<14-10,Raj>也算不上是最差劲的
<14-10,Raj>Yeah, but not my worst, either.

393
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,950
<15-1,Sheldon>我就以前对你说过的刻薄话做过的刻薄事道歉
<15-1,Sheldon>I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you!

394
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,110
<15-2,Howard>我也道歉  全是我的错
<15-2,Howard>I'm sorry, too! It's all my fault!

395
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,920
<15-3,Sheldon>如果没有你这个朋友
<15-3,Sheldon>If you weren't my friend,

396
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,580
<15-3,Sheldon>我的人生会若有所失
<15-3,Sheldon>there'd be a hole in my life!

397
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,250
<15-4,Howard>谢谢你  谢尔顿
<15-4,Howard>Thank you, Sheldon.

398
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,980
<15-5,Sheldon>就好像剧集《萤火虫》被砍了
<15-5,Sheldon>Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled.

399
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,930
<15-5,Sheldon>但失落感没那么严重
<15-5,Sheldon>But not as big.

400
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,030
<15-6,Announcement>机长已经关闭了安全带指示灯
<15-6,Announcement>The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.

401
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,140
<15-6,Announcement>各位可以在机舱内走动了
<15-6,Announcement>You're now free to move about the cabin.

402
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,890
<15-7,Howard>-结束了  -是的
<15-7,Howard>- It's over. - Yeah.

403
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,740
<15-9,Howard>我们是不是应该松开对方的手了
<15-9,Howard>Should we stop holding hands now?

404
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,590
<15-10,Sheldon>-等会吧  -太好了
<15-10,Sheldon>- In a minute. - Okay, good.
