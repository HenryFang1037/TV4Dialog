<1-1,Penny>天啊  我爱死这鸡肉了
<1-1,Penny>Oh, my God. I love this chicken.

<1-2,Sheldon>Oh, you know what they say,

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,850
<1-2,Sheldon>比不上免费的鸡肉

<1-3,Penny>是是是  我是吃了你不少东西
<1-3,Penny>Okay, you're right. I eat your food a lot.

00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,240
<1-3,Penny>不如这样吧
<1-3,Penny>Now, how about this?

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,360
<1-3,Penny>我也让你随时去我冰箱找东西吃
<1-3,Penny>You can raid my fridge anytime you want.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,200
<1-4,Sheldon>还真是"良心"发现啊
<1-4,Sheldon>Oh, that's very kind of you.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,410
<1-4,Sheldon>等下次我想吃"汁多味美"的一号电池
<1-4,Sheldon>Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D-cell battery

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,310
<1-4,Sheldon>再配一罐陈年腌瓜汁时
<1-4,Sheldon>with a jar of old pickle juice,

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,760
<1-4,Sheldon>我会去找你的
<1-4,Sheldon>I'll come a-knockin'.

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,220
<1-5,Howard>拉杰  你没有回复我的婚礼邀请函啊
<1-5,Howard>Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in.

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,100
<1-5,Howard>我得知道你是否会带女伴来
<1-5,Howard>I'm suppose to ask you if you're bringing someone to the wedding.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,130
<1-6,Raj>我再通知你
<1-6,Raj>I'll let you know.

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,010
<1-7,Howard>能快点吗
<1-7,Howard>Well, can you make it soon?

15
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,500
<1-7,Howard>有人在打擂台要抢婚礼席位呢
<1-7,Howard>There's a battle royale going on over the seating charts.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,150
<1-7,Howard>擂台一角有伯纳黛特的老妈
<1-7,Howard>In one corner, Bernadette's mom,

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,190
<1-7,Howard>而另三角  是我老妈
<1-7,Howard>in the other three, mine.

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,120
<1-8,Sheldon>我最讨厌去婚宴了
<1-8,Sheldon>Yeah, I hate wedding receptions.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,050
<1-8,Sheldon>真希望新郎新娘能学学比尔博·巴金斯
<1-8,Sheldon>Yeah, I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins.

20
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,110
<1-8,Sheldon>比尔博·巴金斯  《魔戒》人物  曾是至尊魔戒的持有者
<1-8,Sheldon>戴上魔戒后  有隐身的功能

21
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,110
<1-8,Sheldon>戴上戒指  隐身  大家就各回各家
<1-8,Sheldon>Slip on the ring, disappear, and everyone goes home.

22
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,610
<1-9,Leonard>你不是挺喜欢盖瑟教授的婚礼吗
<1-9,Leonard>Mm, you liked Professor Geyser's wedding.

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,140
<1-9,Leonard>他婚礼上有个圣代自助吧
<1-9,Leonard>They had a make-your-own-sundae bar.

24
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,160
<1-10,Sheldon>多么令人难忘的一夜啊
<1-10,Sheldon>Oh, that was a night to remember.

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,480
<1-10,Sheldon>告诉你  有次我从头到尾就只吃了碗坚果
<1-10,Sheldon>Do you know, on one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.

26
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,420
<1-11,Howard>总而言之  你带不带人来都得赶紧通知我
<1-11,Howard>Anyway, you got to let me know if you have a plus one.

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,710
<1-11,Howard>你不带人的话  位子就让给那位
<1-11,Howard>Because if not, my mom's trying to sneak in the doctor

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,830
<1-11,Howard>帮我妈脖子做抽脂的医生啦
<1-11,Howard>who sucked the fat out of her neck.

29
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,100
<1-12,Raj>好吧  行
<1-12,Raj>All right, uh, fine.

<1-12,Raj>我会来  而且会携伴出席
<1-12,Raj>I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody.

<1-12,Raj>库萨帕里  加个伴
<1-12,Raj>Uh, Koothrappali plus one.

<1-15,Penny>他带我来啊  你带谁呢
<1-15,Penny>He's bringing me; who are you bringing?

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,190
<1-16,Raj>哎哟  好一群多管闲事的美国佬啊
<1-16,Raj>Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells.

<1-17,Howard>Come on, who is it?

37
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,910
<1-18,Raj>就是不说
<1-18,Raj>I'm not telling.

38
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,980
<1-18,Raj>我是神秘的亚洲人  天机不可泄露
<1-18,Raj>I'm from Asia, I'm mysterious, deal with it.

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,220
<1-19,Sheldon>霍华德  你会弄个圣代自助吧吗
<1-19,Sheldon>Howard aren't having a make-your-own-sundae bar?

40
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,780
<1-20,Howard>应该不会吧
<1-20,Howard>I don't think so.

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,740
<1-20,Howard>那我建议你弄一个
<1-20,Howard>Well, you should.

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,980
<1-21,Sheldon>五成的婚姻都是以离婚告终
<1-21,Sheldon>50% of marriages end in divorce,

43
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,430
<1-21,Sheldon>但十成十的圣代自助吧都是以幸福收场
<1-21,Sheldon>but 100% of make-your-own-sundae bars end in happiness.

53
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,680
<2-1,Raj (on skype)>妈妈  爸爸  你们好吗
<2-1,Raj (on skype)>Hello, Mummy, Daddy. How are you?

54

<2-2,Mrs Koothrappali>还行  没啥好抱怨的
<2-2,Mrs Koothrappali>Pretty good. Can't complain.

<2-3,Dr Koothrappali>亲爱的  你肯定行
<2-3,Dr Koothrappali>Oh, I'm sure you can.

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
<2-3,Dr Koothrappali>酝酿一下  抱怨自然来
<2-3,Dr Koothrappali>Just give it a minute.

57
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,540
<2-4,Raj>是这样的
<2-4,Raj>Listen, uh,

58
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,490
<2-4,Raj>我想告诉你们一件事
<2-4,Raj>there's something I want to talk to you about.

59
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,390
<2-4,Raj>之前我一直没做好心理准备
<2-4,Raj>I wasn't ready until now, but...

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,990
<2-4,Raj>现在时机已到
<2-4,Raj>I think it's time.

61
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,290
<2-5,Dr Koothrappali>终究还是发生了
<2-5,Dr Koothrappali>It's finally happening.

62
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,590
<2-5,Dr Koothrappali>你要出柜了  对吧
<2-5,Dr Koothrappali>You're coming out of the closet, aren't you?

63
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,780
<2-6,Mrs Koothrappali>我们爱你  也能接受你不同的生活方式
<2-6,Mrs Koothrappali>We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle.

64
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,430
<2-6,Mrs Koothrappali>你别...张扬乱搞就行了
<2-6,Mrs Koothrappali>Just... keep it to yourself.

65
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,980
<2-7,Raj>没有  我才不是同性恋
<2-7,Raj>No, I'm not gay.

66
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,750
<2-7,Raj>人家顶多是都市花美男
<2-7,Raj>If anything, I'm metrosexual.

67
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,450
<2-8,Dr Koothrappali>那是什么啊
<2-8,Dr Koothrappali>What's that?

68
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,940
<2-9,Raj>就是  我爱女人  也爱她们的保养品
<2-9,Raj>It means I like women as well as their skin-care products.

69
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,700
<2-10,Dr Koothrappali>好吧  如果你不是要出柜
<2-10,Dr Koothrappali>Well, if you're not coming out,

71
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,680
<2-10,Dr Koothrappali>那干嘛还打扰我们看板球半决赛
<2-10,Dr Koothrappali>why did you call us during the cricket semifinals?

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,030
<2-11,Raj>在人海中寻觅真爱的日子  我过累了
<2-11,Raj>I'm tired of trying to meet someone,

73
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,380
<2-11,Raj>我想请你们帮忙我找个...
<2-11,Raj>and I think I'd like you to help me find a...

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,160
<2-11,Raj>老婆
<2-11,Raj>a wife.

75
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,350
<2-12,Mrs Koothrappali>我就问清楚
<2-12,Mrs Koothrappali>And just to clarify...

76
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,310
<2-12,Mrs Koothrappali>是女性的老婆吗
<2-12,Mrs Koothrappali>a female wife?

77
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,010
<2-13,Raj>是的
<2-13,Raj>Yes!

78
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,380
<2-14,Dr Koothrappali>包办婚姻  聪明的选择啊  儿子
<2-14,Dr Koothrappali>Matchmaking-- very smart move, son.

79
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,910
<2-14,Dr Koothrappali>比自由恋爱的婚姻好多了
<2-14,Dr Koothrappali>Much better than marrying for love.

80
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,240
<2-15,Mrs Koothrappali>我们当初就是自由恋爱的啊
<2-15,Mrs Koothrappali>We married for love.

81
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,330
<2-16,Dr Koothrappali>所以过得多么幸福美满啊
<2-16,Dr Koothrappali>And it's been wonderful!

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
<3-1,Sheldon>量子力学真让我满心欢喜
<3-1,Sheldon>Quantum physics makes me so happy.

83
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,730
<3-2,Leonard>恭喜恭喜
<3-2,Leonard>Yeah, I'm glad.

84
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,910
<3-3,Sheldon>如同看着一丝不挂的宇宙
<3-3,Sheldon>It's like looking at the universe naked.

85
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,270
<3-4,Penny>能打扰一下吗
<3-4,Penny>Hi. Guys got a minute?

86
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,600
<3-5,Leonard>行啊  什么事
<3-5,Leonard>Sure. What's up?

87
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,050
<3-6,Penny>我想到谢尔顿开的小玩笑
<3-6,Penny>Well, I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke

88
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,800
<3-6,Penny>就那天晚上说我老蹭你们东西吃
<3-6,Penny>the other night about me eating all your food.

89
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,140
<3-7,Sheldon>那不是在开玩笑  不过...
<3-7,Sheldon>Oh! That was no joke. But...

90
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,030
<3-7,Sheldon>我能理解你以为我是说笑
<3-7,Sheldon>I understand your confusion,

91
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,580
<3-7,Sheldon>毕竟我一直是咱们小团体中的笑话王
<3-7,Sheldon>as I am our group's resident cutup.

92
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,180
<3-8,Leonard>不是吧  你还是小团体中的笑话王吗
<3-8,Leonard>I'm sorry, you are our resident cutup?

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,880
<3-9,Sheldon>当然
<3-9,Sheldon>Yes.

94
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,540
<3-10,Leonard>证明一下
<3-10,Leonard>Oh, prove it.

95
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,260
<3-11,Sheldon>敲敲门  敲敲门
<3-11,Sheldon>Knock-knock.

96
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,770
<3-12,Leonard>-谁呢  -插嘴物理学家
<3-12,Leonard>- Who's there? - Interrupting physicist.

97
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,030
<3-13,Sheldon>这改编自插嘴牛的笑话
<3-13,Sheldon>当对方问牛怎么插嘴  你就用牛叫声[哞Moo]插嘴

98
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,030
<3-15,Sheldon>-物理学家怎么插...   -介子[哞哞]
<3-15,Sheldon>- Interrupting phys... - Muon!

99
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,520
<3-16,Penny>言归正传  我收到了我广告的尾款
<3-16,Penny>Anyway, I got a little residual check from my commercial,

100
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,220
<3-16,Penny>我想了想  不如给你们
<3-16,Penny>and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys

101
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,510
<3-16,Penny>买点感恩礼物当做回报吧
<3-16,Penny>a little thank you to pay them back?

102
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,910
<3-16,Penny>所以呢  谢尔顿
<3-16,Penny>So, Sheldon...

<3-19,Penny>斯图尔特的漫画店里买的
<3-19,Penny>From Stuart, at the comic book store.

110
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,930
<3-20,Leonard>你孤身一人走进了漫画店啊
<3-20,Leonard>You went to the comic book store by yourself?

111
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,950
<3-21,Penny>是啊  挺好玩的
<3-21,Penny>Yeah. It was fun.

112
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,780
<3-21,Penny>我一走进  俩男的立刻被迷得哮喘发作
<3-21,Penny>I walked in, and two different guys got asthma attacks.

113
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,340
<3-21,Penny>感觉真爽啊

114
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,110
<3-22,Sheldon>这个应该表示一下感谢
<3-22,Sheldon>This calls for an expression of gratitude.

115
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,670
<3-23,Penny>哟  是不是要给我一个罕见的谢氏拥抱
<3-23,Penny>Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

116
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,050
<3-24,Sheldon>这次不行  不然我的拥抱就掉价了
<3-24,Sheldon>No, not this time. Then they wouldn't be special.

117
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,830
<3-24,Sheldon>谢了  佩妮

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,950
<3-28,Leonard>太帅了
<3-28,Leonard>Awesome!

127
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,060
<3-29,Sheldon>这是专门配我的珍藏版史波克模型的呢
<3-29,Sheldon>Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr. Spock action figure.

128
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,080
<3-30,Penny>那太好了  我们快拆开把他放进传送机吧
<3-30,Penny>Oh, that's great! Let's open them up and put him in there.

129
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,870
<3-32,Sheldon>-打开?!  -老天啊  不行
<3-32,Sheldon>- Open it?! - Oh, good Lord, no!

130
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,380
<3-33,Penny>为什么  玩具不是拿来玩的吗
<3-33,Penny>Why? They're just toys.

131
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,300
<3-34,Sheldon>-拿来收藏的  -全新没开封的
<3-34,Sheldon>- They're collectibles. - They're mint-in-box.

132
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,190
<3-36,Penny>拜托  打开来看看也不行吗
<3-36,Penny>Come on. Can't we open one up and take a look?

133
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,670
<3-37,Together>不行
<3-37,Together>No, don't!

134
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,590
<3-38,Leonard>一旦开封了就不值钱了
<3-38,Leonard>Once you open the box, it loses its value.

135
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,070
<3-39,Penny>我妈也曾教育我  要用这种态度对待童贞
<3-39,Penny>Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity.

136
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,970
<3-39,Penny>不过我觉得  与其收着发霉
<3-39,Penny>Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun

137
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,970
<3-39,Penny>不如拿出来多晒晒"太阳"
<3-39,Penny>taking it out and playing with it.

138
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,850
<4-1,Bernadette>你确定要我们陪你见相亲对象吗
<4-1,Bernadette>Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?

139
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,600
<4-1,Bernadette>确定
<4-1,Bernadette>Oh, yes.

140
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,640
<4-2,Raj>按照我们的习俗
<4-2,Raj>In my culture, it's expected

141
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,140
<4-2,Raj>相亲时就得带个伴来帮过过眼
<4-2,Raj>to have a chaperone to oversee a first date.

142
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,350
<4-2,Raj>况且我想留个好印象  说了你们别生气
<4-2,Raj>Plus, I want to make a good impression, and no offense,

143
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,630
<4-2,Raj>跟你们在一起  我看上去就像一米八的
<4-2,Raj>but with you guys here, I look like I'm six-two.

144
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,710
<4-3,Bernadette>我们高中舞会时修女也老是盯着我们
<4-3,Bernadette>The nuns always chaperoned the dances at my high school.

145
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,970
<4-3,Bernadette>她们总是要我们保持距离  留点空间给圣灵
<4-3,Bernadette>They used to make us leave room between us for the Holy Spirit.

146
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,170
<4-4,Howard>印度人也这样
<4-4,Howard>Uh, Hindus do the same thing.

147
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,250
<4-4,Howard>只不过他们留空间给牛
<4-4,Howard>Except they leave room for a cow.

148
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,320
<4-5,Raj>我很欣赏你的种族歧视幽默感
<4-5,Raj>Listen, I love your charming racist humor,

149
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,470
<4-5,Raj>但能不能别在女人面前  嘲笑我的宗教信仰呢
<4-5,Raj>but any chance you could not mock my religion while she's here?

150
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,300
<4-6,Howard>你昨天还笑我吃熏鲑鱼呢
<4-6,Howard>Yesterday, you made fun of me for eating lox.

151
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,510
<4-7,Raj>那不一样  你们犹太人又不崇拜鲑鱼
<4-7,Raj>It's different, your people don't worship lox.

152
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,640
<4-8,Howard>显然你没跟我堂兄妹吃过早午餐
<4-8,Howard>Clearly, you've never been to brunch with my cousins.

153
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,360
<4-9,Bernadette>包办婚姻是不是双方父母一旦决定
<4-9,Bernadette>So, arranged marriages-- the parents just decide

154
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,200
<4-9,Bernadette>你们就得结婚
<4-9,Bernadette>and then you have to get married?

155
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,990
<4-10,Raj>不是  我有说话权的
<4-10,Raj>No, no, I get a say in it.

156
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,950
<4-10,Raj>不过我相信不管什么样的人来
<4-10,Raj>But I'm sure whoever shows up will be better company

158
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,060
<4-10,Raj>都比跟杰迈玛大婶和巴特沃斯夫人
<4-10,Raj>than the threesome I've been having

159
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,610
<4-10,Raj>在厨房里玩3P要好得多
<4-10,Raj>with Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth.

160
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,560
<4-11,Girl>请问  你是拉杰什吗
<4-11,Girl>Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

161
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,790
<4-11,Girl>我是
<4-11,Girl>Ah, yes.

162
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,050
<4-12,Raj>你应该是拉克希米吧
<4-12,Raj>You must be Lakshmi.

163
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,040
<4-12,Raj>很高兴认识你
<4-12,Raj>Uh, nice to meet you.

164
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,580
<4-13,Lakshmi>我也是
<4-13,Lakshmi>Nice to meet you, too.

165
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,940
<4-14,Raj>这两位是我朋友
<4-14,Raj>Oh! These are my friends.

166
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,450
<4-14,Raj>-这位是伯纳黛特  -你好
<4-14,Raj>- This is Bernadette. - Hello.

167
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,180
<4-16,Raj>-这位是霍华德  -幸会
<4-16,Raj>- And this is Howard. - Nice to meet you.

168
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,280
<4-18,Lakshmi>-幸会  -请坐
<4-18,Lakshmi>- You, too. - Please, have a seat.

169
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,700
<4-19,Raj>双重婚礼有戏了
<4-19,Raj>I'm thinking double wedding.

170
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,780
<5-1,Voice of Spock>库珀博士
<5-1,Voice of Spock>Dr. Cooper.

171
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,160
<5-1,Voice of Spock>库珀博士
<5-1,Voice of Spock>Dr. Cooper?

172
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,550
<5-2,Sheldon>谁在说话
<5-2,Sheldon>Is someone there?

173
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,240
<5-3,Spock>在这里  你桌子上
<5-3,Spock>Down here. On your desk.

174
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,410
<5-4,Sheldon>史波克
<5-4,Sheldon>Spock?

175
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,520
<5-5,Spock>我需要跟你谈谈
<5-5,Spock>I need to speak with you.

176
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,570
<5-6,Sheldon>太奇妙了
<5-6,Sheldon>Fascinating.

177
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,740
<5-6,Sheldon>唯一合乎逻辑的解释就是  这是梦
<5-6,Sheldon>The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.

178
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,950
<5-7,Spock>做梦也不是唯一合乎逻辑的解释
<5-7,Spock>It is not the only logical explanation.

179
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,340
<5-7,Spock>比如  你之所以产生幻觉
<5-7,Spock>For example, you could be hallucinating

180
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,430
<5-7,Spock>是因为被某物砸到头  比如说
<5-7,Spock>after being hit on the head by,say,

181
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,150
<5-8,Sheldon>椰子
<5-8,Sheldon>a coconut.

182
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,880
<5-8,Sheldon>我真的被椰子砸到头了?
<5-8,Sheldon>Was I hit on the head by a coconut?

183
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,770
<5-8,Sheldon>我不想就此做出任何回应
<5-8,Sheldon>I am not going to dignify that with a response.

184
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,870
<5-9,Spock>先说要紧事
<5-9,Spock>Now to the matter at hand.

185
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,810
<5-9,Spock>你要玩这个传送机玩具
<5-9,Spock>You need to play with the transporter toy.

186
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,470
<5-10,Sheldon>可这是全新没开封的
<5-10,Sheldon>But it's mint-in-box.

187
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,210
<5-10,Sheldon>没错
<5-10,Sheldon>Yes.

188
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,660
<5-11,Spock>而且开封了就毁了它的价值
<5-11,Spock>And to open it would destroy its value.

189
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,310
<5-11,Spock>但你要记住  你跟我一样
<5-11,Spock>But remember, like me,

190
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,910
<5-11,Spock>也有一半人类血统
<5-11,Spock>you also have a human half.

191
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,910
<5-12,Sheldon>我不想就此做出任何回应
<5-12,Sheldon>Well, I'm not going to dignify that with a response.

192
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,060
<5-13,Spock>你想一想
<5-13,Spock>Consider this.

193
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,590
<5-13,Spock>玩具的意义在于什么
<5-13,Spock>What is the purpose of a toy?

194
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,070
<5-14,Sheldon>给人玩
<5-14,Sheldon>To be played with.

195
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,270
<5-15,Spock>那么  不给人玩意味着...
<5-15,Spock>Therefore, to not play with it would be...?

196
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,280
<5-16,Sheldon>不合常理
<5-16,Sheldon>Illogical.

197
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,170
<5-16,Sheldon>该死  史波克  你说得对
<5-16,Sheldon>Damn it, Spock, you're right.

198
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,490
<5-16,Sheldon>我这就开封
<5-16,Sheldon>I'll do it.

199
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,030
<5-17,Spock>谢尔顿  等等
<5-17,Spock>Sheldon, wait.

200
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,790
<5-17,Spock>你得先醒来
<5-17,Spock>You have to wake up first.

201
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,310
<5-18,Sheldon>当然
<5-18,Sheldon>Oh, of course.

202
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,020
<5-18,Sheldon>先设好相位仪  对吧
<5-18,Sheldon>Set phasers to dumb, right?

203
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,420
<5-18,Sheldon>赶紧  赶快  马上
<5-18,Sheldon>Goodie, goodie, goodie!

204
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,420
<5-18,Sheldon>这样不对  这样不对
<5-18,Sheldon>This is wrong, this is wrong.

205
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,460
<5-18,Sheldon>太兴奋了  可这样不对
<5-18,Sheldon>I'm so excited, but this is wrong.

206
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,350
<5-18,Sheldon>我要开封了
<5-18,Sheldon>I'm going to do it.

207
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,270
<5-18,Sheldon>我在开封了
<5-18,Sheldon>I'm doing it.

208
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,020
<5-18,Sheldon>开完了
<5-18,Sheldon>I did it.

209
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,110
<5-18,Sheldon>跟我想象中的1975年的味道一样
<5-18,Sheldon>That's what I always thought 1975 smelled like.

210
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,550
<5-18,Sheldon>斯科特  送我下去
<5-18,Sheldon>One to beam down, Mr. Scott.

211
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,490
<5-18,Sheldon>遵命  史波克
<5-18,Sheldon>Aye, aye, Mr. Spock.

212
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,070
<5-18,Sheldon>启动
<5-18,Sheldon>Energize.

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,530
<5-18,Sheldon>启动
<5-18,Sheldon>Energize.

214
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,870
<5-18,Sheldon>别坏啊
<5-18,Sheldon>Don't be broken.

215
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,550
<5-18,Sheldon>求求你  千万别坏
<5-18,Sheldon>Oh, please, don't be broken.

216
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,790
<5-18,Sheldon>瞧你让我干的好事
<5-18,Sheldon>What did you make me do?!

217
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,770
<5-18,Sheldon>冷静冷静  动动脑子
<5-18,Sheldon>Okay, okay, think.

218
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,110
<5-18,Sheldon>这样完全合乎常理
<5-18,Sheldon>It's only logical.

219
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,150
<6-1,Lakshmi>天啊  这真是太好吃了
<6-1,Lakshmi>My goodness, that was delicious.

220
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,400
<6-2,Raj>我希望你还吃得下巧克力软心蛋糕
<6-2,Raj>Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.

221
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,020
<6-3,Lakshmi>不错嘛
<6-3,Lakshmi>Impressive.

222
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,240
<6-3,Lakshmi>你怎么想到做这个
<6-3,Lakshmi>What goes into making something like that?

223
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,860
<6-4,Raj>其实呢  最开始
<6-4,Raj>Well, you start out by trying to

224
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,780
<6-4,Raj>我是想做巧克力酥的  结果失败了  我慌了
<6-4,Raj>make chocolate souffl? And when it falls, you panic,

225
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,870
<6-4,Raj>赶紧改个名字  当当  就变成软心蛋糕了
<6-4,Raj>quickly change the name, and voila, lava cake.

226
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,860
<6-5,Lakshmi>我们的家长现在肯定很想知道进展如何
<6-5,Lakshmi>I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.

227
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,930
<6-6,Raj>一起看看
<6-6,Raj>Well, let's see.

228
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,280
<6-6,Raj>没错  有三通未接电话
<6-6,Raj>Yep, three missed calls.

229
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,040
<6-7,Lakshmi>四通未接电话  两条短信
<6-7,Lakshmi>Four missed calls, two text messages

230
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,420
<6-7,Lakshmi>一次视频聊天邀请失败  我赢了
<6-7,Lakshmi>and a failed video chat. I win!

231
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,490
<6-7,Lakshmi>那我们该怎么跟他们说呢
<6-7,Lakshmi>So, what are we going to tell them?

232
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,110
<6-8,Raj>我觉得一切进展顺利
<6-8,Raj>I'd like to tell them things are going well.

233
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,220
<6-9,Lakshmi>同意
<6-9,Lakshmi>Me, too.

234
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,780
<6-9,Lakshmi>但在燃起他们的希望之前
<6-9,Lakshmi>But before we get their hopes up,

235
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,840
<6-9,Lakshmi>得先弄清楚我们的步调是否一致
<6-9,Lakshmi>we should probably make sure we're on the same page.

236
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,420
<6-9,Lakshmi>好
<6-9,Lakshmi>Okay.

237
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,430
<6-10,Raj>那你现在走到哪一步
<6-10,Raj>What page are you on?

238
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,010
<6-11,Lakshmi>我现在走到  父母不断施压
<6-11,Lakshmi>I'm on the one where I'm under a lot of pressure

239
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,650
<6-11,Lakshmi>逼我结婚定下来
<6-11,Lakshmi>from my parents to get married and settle down

240
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,920
<6-11,Lakshmi>组建家庭
<6-11,Lakshmi>and have a family,

241
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,690
<6-11,Lakshmi>所以我会乖乖结婚  好隐瞒我是拉拉的事实
<6-11,Lakshmi>and I'm going to do it so they don't find out I'm gay.

242
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,040
<6-12,Raj>你说什么
<6-12,Raj>Say again?

243
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,990
<6-13,Lakshmi>我是拉拉
<6-13,Lakshmi>I'm gay.

244
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,800
<6-14,Raj>好比男男
<6-14,Raj>Like... dude-on-dude,

245
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,380
<6-14,Raj>但你是女女吗
<6-14,Raj>but with women?

246
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,990
<6-15,Lakshmi>我知道假结婚的只是一场骗局
<6-15,Lakshmi>I know a fake marriage isn't an honest way to live,

247
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,930
<6-15,Lakshmi>但你一定比其他人更理解  我们的文化中
<6-15,Lakshmi>but you of all people should know how difficult it is

248
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,760
<6-15,Lakshmi>出柜是多么难以被接受
<6-15,Lakshmi>to come out in our culture.

249
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,230
<6-16,Raj>为什么我比其他人更理解
<6-16,Raj>Why me of all people?!

250
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,440
<6-17,Lakshmi>你老家新德里那里有传言  说你...
<6-17,Lakshmi>Well, there's a rumor back in New Delhi that you're--

251
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
<6-17,Lakshmi>委婉点说好了
<6-17,Lakshmi>how shall we say--

252
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,860
<6-17,Lakshmi>身穿男服  心在纱丽
<6-17,Lakshmi>comfortable in a sari.

253
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,300
<6-18,Raj>我不是基佬
<6-18,Raj>I'm not gay!

254
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,690
<6-19,Lakshmi>真的吗  巧克力软心蛋糕

<6-19,Lakshmi>浴室的小肥皂
<6-19,Lakshmi>the little soaps in the bathroom,

256
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,060
<6-19,Lakshmi>而且  你身上的"香水"味比我还重呢
<6-19,Lakshmi>and I'm sorry, but you're wearing more perfume than I am.

257
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,060
<6-20,Raj>那可是科勒和拉马尔的"固若金汤"
<6-20,Raj>That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar.

258
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,430
<6-20,Raj>顺便告诉你一下  这是中性香水
<6-20,Raj>And for your information, it's unisex.

259
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,760
<6-21,Lakshmi>玩个填空游戏吧
<6-21,Lakshmi>Fill in the blank.

260
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,150
<6-21,Lakshmi>我爱夜生活
<6-21,Lakshmi>I love the nightlife...

261
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,460
<6-22,Raj>我爱布"基"[舞蹈]
<6-22,Raj>I like to boogie.

262
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,490
<6-23,Lakshmi>露馅了吧

<6-24,Raj>是跟女人跳  我爱跟女人跳布吉
<6-24,Raj>With women! I like to boogie with women!

264
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
<6-25,Lakshmi>真让人失望
<6-25,Lakshmi>That's disappointing.

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,380
<6-25,Lakshmi>你就是我想要的带"把儿"假老公
<6-25,Lakshmi>You were exactly the kind of phony-baloney husband

266
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,010
<6-25,Lakshmi>最完美的人选
<6-25,Lakshmi>I was looking for.

267
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,980
<6-25,Lakshmi>谢谢
<6-25,Lakshmi>Thank you.

268
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,710
<6-26,Raj>重申一次  我的"把儿"喜欢女人
<6-26,Raj>And once again, my baloney likes girls.

269
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,350
<6-24,Raj>慢着
<6-24,Raj>W-W-Wait!

270
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,150
<6-26,Raj>在没尝过我自制的香堤伊奶油之前
<6-26,Raj>You don't want to put a bite of that in your mouth

271
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,160
<6-26,Raj>最好先一口都别吃
<6-26,Raj>without trying my homemade Chantilly cream.

272
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,220
<6-26,Raj>好吧  这次我听出来基味了
<6-26,Raj>Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.

273
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,200
<6-26,Raj>天啊
<6-26,Raj>Oh, dear.

274
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,780
<7-1,Sheldon>两个太阳  没带防晒乳
<7-1,Sheldon>Two suns and no sunscreen.

275
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,240
<7-2,Spock>你好  谢尔顿
<7-2,Spock>Hello again, Sheldon.

276
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,110
<7-3,Sheldon>又怎么了  小小史波克
<7-3,Sheldon>What is it now, Tiny Spock?

277
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,640
<7-4,Spock>我对你非常失望
<7-4,Spock>I am very disappointed in you.

278
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,300
<7-4,Spock>你弄坏了自己的玩具  然后偷换给莱纳德
<7-4,Spock>You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard's.

279
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,620
<7-4,Spock>你应该为自己的行为感到羞耻
<7-4,Spock>You should be ashamed of yourself.

280
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,940
<7-5,Sheldon>是你让我玩玩具的
<7-5,Sheldon>You're the one who told me to play with it.

281
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,540
<7-6,Spock>那我让你从进取号的舰桥上跳下来
<7-6,Spock>If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise,

282
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,800
<7-6,Spock>你会照办吗
<7-6,Spock>would you do it?

283
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,990
<7-7,Sheldon>如果我上了进取号的舰桥
<7-7,Sheldon>Oh, if I got on the bridge of the Enterprise,

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,270
<7-7,Sheldon>我死也不会跳出去
<7-7,Sheldon>I would never, ever leave.

285
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,440
<7-8,Spock>相信我  很快就会玩腻了
<7-8,Spock>Trust me, it gets old after a while.

286
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,400
<7-8,Spock>你必须改正你的错误  谢尔顿
<7-8,Spock>You must right your wrongs, Sheldon.

287
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,910
<7-9,Sheldon>为什么  我成功蒙混过关了
<7-9,Sheldon>Why? I got away with it.

288
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,150
<7-9,Sheldon>莱纳德有他的玩具  而且永远也不会打开
<7-9,Sheldon>Leonard has his toy, and he's never going to open it,

289
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,540
<7-9,Sheldon>所以不会知道那是坏的
<7-9,Sheldon>so he won't know it's broken.

290
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,870
<7-9,Sheldon>而我得到了一个完好无损的玩具
<7-9,Sheldon>And I have a toy that isn't broken.

291
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,110
<7-9,Sheldon>皆大欢喜
<7-9,Sheldon>Everybody's happy.

292
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,020
<7-10,Spock>错  我不开心
<7-10,Spock>Well, I am unhappy.

293
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:34,950
<7-10,Spock>《星际迷航》史波克是人类与瓦肯人的混血
<7-10,Spock>瓦肯人是个几乎能克制所有情感的种族

294
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,910
<7-11,Sheldon>我以为你是来自无情绪星球的呢
<7-11,Sheldon>I thought where you come from they don't have emotions.

295
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,950
<7-12,Spock>我来自台湾的一家玩具工厂
<7-12,Spock>I come from a factory in Taiwan.

296
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
<7-12,Spock>现在快去改正错误
<7-12,Spock>Now, do the right thing.

297
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,910
<7-13,Sheldon>知道你是什么吗
<7-13,Sheldon>You know what you are?

299
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,530
<7-13,Sheldon>你是个冷血的扫兴绿鬼
<7-13,Sheldon>Well, you're a green-blooded buzz kill.

300
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,230
<7-13,Sheldon>你现在还是赶紧传送走吧
<7-13,Sheldon>Perhaps it's time you beam on out of here.

301
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,140
<7-14,Spock>好吧
<7-14,Spock>Fine.

302
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,300
<7-14,Spock>我用传送机把自己传送走吧
<7-14,Spock>I will just use the transporter.

303
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,950
<7-14,Spock>哎呀  我忘了
<7-14,Spock>Oh, right.

304
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,750
<7-14,Spock>你把它弄坏了
<7-14,Spock>You broke it.

305
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,680
<7-15,Sheldon>很好
<7-15,Sheldon>Very well.

306
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,980
<7-15,Sheldon>库珀呼叫进取号  请求传送一人
<7-15,Sheldon>Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up.

307
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,850
<7-15,Sheldon>开始传送
<7-15,Sheldon>Energize.

308
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,060
<7-15,Sheldon>小小史波克  救命啊
<7-15,Sheldon>Tiny Spock, help.

309
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,860
<8-1,Raj>要去吃午餐了吗
<8-1,Raj>Ready for lunch?

310
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,180
<8-2,Howard>要的  等一下
<8-2,Howard>Yeah, one sec.

311
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,010
<8-2,Howard>好了  我老妈要是发现
<8-2,Howard>Oh, good. Ma would've killed me

312
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,250
<8-2,Howard>我把牙保持器弄坏了会杀了我的
<8-2,Howard>if she found out I broke my retainer.

313
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,200
<8-3,Raj>我可以跟你谈个事情吗  跟拉希米有关
<8-3,Raj>Can I run something by you? It's about Lakshmi.

314
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,300
<8-4,Howard>好  说吧  发展得怎么样了
<8-4,Howard>Yeah, sure. How are things going?

315
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,830
<8-5,Raj>我们有几个小问题
<8-5,Raj>We hit a couple of bumps.

316
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,230
<8-5,Raj>她住在曼哈顿海滩
<8-5,Raj>She lives over in Manhattan Beach,

317
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,290
<8-5,Raj>我得花一个小时才能到她家
<8-5,Raj>so it takes, like, an hour to get there.

318
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,120
<8-6,Howard>而且她是个拉拉
<8-6,Howard>And she's a lesbian.

319
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,880
<8-6,Howard>你说她是"拉拉"是什么意思
<8-6,Howard>What do you mean, "she's a lesbian"?

320
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,180
<8-7,Raj>还记得每次我们去酒吧泡妞
<8-7,Raj>Well, you know how whenever you and I would try

321
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,150
<8-7,Raj>只要失败了  我们就会互相安慰
<8-7,Raj>to hit on women in bars and they'd blow us off

322
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,770
<8-7,Raj>说那女的铁定是同性恋吗
<8-7,Raj>and then we'd tell each other they were probably gay?

323
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,950
<8-7,Raj>就像那样啊
<8-7,Raj>It's like that.

324
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,890
<8-7,Raj>只是这次  她是真的同性恋
<8-7,Raj>Except this time, it's true.

325
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,780
<8-8,Howard>那她干嘛还出来跟你相亲啊
<8-8,Howard>Then why did she even go out with you?

326
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,840
<8-9,Raj>她想找个老公假结婚来掩盖事实
<8-9,Raj>She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight.

327
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,680
<8-9,Raj>虽然这主意
<8-9,Raj>And, you know,

328
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,740
<8-9,Raj>乍听之下挺疯狂的
<8-9,Raj>it sounded crazy to me at first...

329
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,230
<8-9,Raj>但我真的有考虑跟她结婚
<8-9,Raj>but I'm actually thinking about doing it.

330
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,220
<8-10,Howard>这事情乍听就很疯狂是因为
<8-10,Howard>Okay, so the reason that might sound crazy...

331
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,710
<8-10,Howard>这本来就很疯狂啊
<8-10,Howard>is 'cause it's crazy!

332
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,030
<8-11,Raj>霍华德  你有女朋友了
<8-11,Raj>Look, Howard, you're in a relationship.

333
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,750
<8-11,Raj>你当然不用妥协
<8-11,Raj>You know you have to make compromises.

334
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,440
<8-12,Howard>但我要妥协的是  买哪种床单
<8-12,Howard>Yes, but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy

335
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,460
<8-12,Howard>或者今天该轮到谁洗衣服啦
<8-12,Howard>or whose turn it is to do the laundry,

336
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,360
<8-12,Howard>伯纳黛特还是我妈
<8-12,Howard>Bernadette's or my mom's.

337
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,050
<8-13,Raj>跟她结婚很合算啊
<8-13,Raj>It's a great deal.

338
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,140
<8-13,Raj>我和她都能摆脱父母的控制
<8-13,Raj>We both get our parents off our backs,

339
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,670
<8-13,Raj>每晚回家不用再面对空荡荡的屋子
<8-13,Raj>I don't have to come home to an empty apartment every night.

340
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,460
<8-13,Raj>再说结了婚  我就尽情吃碳水化合物了
<8-13,Raj>Plus, once I'm married, I can finally eat carbs again

342
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,540
<8-13,Raj>不用再担心身材问题
<8-13,Raj>and let myself go.

343
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,400
<8-14,Howard>何不告诉你父母
<8-14,Howard>Why don't you tell your parents

344
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,770
<8-14,Howard>你想另寻意中人
<8-14,Howard>you want to try to find someone else?

345
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,120
<8-14,Howard>或许找个睡过的女人比你少的伴儿
<8-14,Howard>Maybe one who hasn't slept with more woman than you.

346
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,010
<8-15,Raj>但这个女人想跟我结婚
<8-15,Raj>Because this one wants to marry me.

347
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,210
<8-15,Raj>我从没找到过想跟我结婚的女人
<8-15,Raj>I might never find another one who does.

348
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,600
<8-16,Howard>所以你真的是在慎重考虑
<8-16,Howard>So you're seriously thinking about marrying someone

349
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,870
<8-16,Howard>要过无性婚姻吗
<8-16,Howard>you're never gonna have sex with?

350
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,550
<8-17,Raj>不敢相信你是这态度
<8-17,Raj>I can't believe your attitude.

351
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,530
<8-17,Raj>你不是向来支持同性恋婚姻的吗
<8-17,Raj>I thought you were in favor of gay people getting married.

352
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,260
<8-18,Howard>没错  我支持的是双方都是同性恋
<8-18,Howard>Yes, to other gay people!

353
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,760
<8-19,Raj>你知道你这话有多"恐同"吗
<8-19,Raj>Do you hear how homophobic you sound?

354
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,260
<9-1,Sheldon>我才不想要坏的
<9-1,Sheldon>Oh, I don't want a broken toy.

355
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,880
<9-3,Sheldon>没事
<9-3,Sheldon>Nothing!

356
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:01,950
<9-2,Leonard>什么
<9-2,Leonard>What?

357
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,660
<9-3,Sheldon>没事  我说了没事
<9-3,Sheldon>Nothing. I said nothing.

358
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,290
<9-4,Penny>好诡异
<9-4,Penny>That was weird.

359
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,390
<9-5,Leonard>真的吗  他的诡异早被我当正常了
<9-5,Leonard>Really? I don't even notice anymore.

360
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,600
<9-6,Penny>我真不敢相信  你们真的不拆出来玩
<9-6,Penny>I cannot believe you guys aren't gonna play with these.

361
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,140
<9-7,Leonard>我说了你不信嘛  全新未开封不能拆
<9-7,Leonard>Well, I told you, you don't. It's mint-in-box.

362
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,860
<9-8,Penny>我不知道  只是觉得浪费
<9-8,Penny>I don't know. I just think it's a waste.

363
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,320
<9-8,Penny>放心啦  我只看看盒子
<9-8,Penny>Relax. I'm just looking at the box.

364
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,060
<9-9,Sheldon>你光用眼睛看就行了
<9-9,Sheldon>Perhaps you should look with your eyes

365
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,060
<9-9,Sheldon>把你那肌肉发达的汉子手拿开
<9-9,Sheldon>and not your muscular Nebraska man hands.

366
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,150
<9-10,Penny>你到底怎么回事啊
<9-10,Penny>What is your problem?!

367
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,680
<9-11,Sheldon>我就是怕你弄坏莱纳德的玩具
<9-11,Sheldon>My problem is that I don't want you to break Leonard's toy.

368
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,410
<9-11,Sheldon>万一你摇一摇  就摇坏了呢
<9-11,Sheldon>Which you probably did by shaking it!

369
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,230
<9-11,Sheldon>她摇过了  我们都看到了啊
<9-11,Sheldon>She shook it, we all saw her.

370
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,880
<9-12,Penny>莱纳德  我送你这个
<9-12,Penny>Leonard, I bought you this

371
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,890
<9-12,Penny>只是想让你玩得开心
<9-12,Penny>'cause I wanted you to have fun with it.

372
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,040
<9-12,Penny>我不想它一直呆在盒子里不见天日
<9-12,Penny>I don't want it to sit in this box.

373
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,710
<9-12,Penny>你说得对
<9-12,Penny>You know, you're right.

374
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,120
<9-13,Leonard>这可是你送我的
<9-13,Leonard>I mean, it's from you,

375
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,780
<9-13,Leonard>我不可能拿出来卖
<9-13,Leonard>I'm never gonna sell it.

376
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,800
<9-13,Leonard>-我这就拆吧  -太好了
<9-13,Leonard>- I'm opening it. - Yes!

377
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,070
<9-16,Leonard>-是坏的  -什么
<9-16,Leonard>- It's broken. - What?

378
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,210
<9-18,Sheldon>瞧你干的好事  汉子手
<9-18,Sheldon>Oh, nice job, man hands!

379
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,760
<9-19,Penny>不是我弄坏的
<9-19,Penny>I didn't break it.

380
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,390
<9-19,Penny>估计斯图尔特卖给我的时候就这样了
<9-19,Penny>I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.

381
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,590
<9-20,Sheldon>没错  肯定是他
<9-20,Sheldon>Yes. Yes, he did.

382
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,020
<9-20,Sheldon>这是最最最可信又最最最合理的解释...
<9-20,Sheldon>That is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explana...

383
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,060
<9-20,Sheldon>要怪就怪斯图尔特吧
<9-20,Sheldon>Let's all be mad at Stuart!

384
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,750
<9-21,Penny>这玩意老贵了
<9-21,Penny>You know, I paid a lot for this.

385
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,060
<9-21,Penny>我们拿回店里给他看吧
<9-21,Penny>Let's take it over there and show him.

386
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,440
<9-22,Leonard>绝对要的
<9-22,Leonard>Absolutely.

387
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,460
<9-22,Leonard>等等
<9-22,Leonard>Wait!

388
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,330
<9-23,Sheldon>是我干的
<9-23,Sheldon>It was me.

389
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,130
<9-23,Sheldon>是我拆开了你的玩具...
<9-23,Sheldon>I opened your toy...

390
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,410
<9-23,Sheldon>发现是坏的  却没有告诉你
<9-23,Sheldon>discovered it was broken and didn't tell you.

391
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,120
<9-24,Leonard>你为什么要拆我的
<9-24,Leonard>Why would you open mine?

392
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,800
<9-27,Sheldon>我没有  我说谎了
<9-27,Sheldon>I didn't. That was a lie.

393
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,030
<9-25,Sheldon>我拆开了自己的
<9-25,Sheldon>I opened my own toy...

394
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,230
<9-25,Sheldon>发现它已经坏了  所以跟你换了个
<9-25,Sheldon>and it was already broken, so I switched them.

395
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,820
<9-26,Leonard>那你该跟斯图尔特说啊
<9-26,Leonard>You should talk to Stuart.

396
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,590
<9-27,Sheldon>不能说  我又说谎了
<9-27,Sheldon>I can't, because that was a lie.

397
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,370
<9-27,Sheldon>你的玩具在地震中坏了...
<9-27,Sheldon>Yours was broken in an earthquake--

398
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,610
<9-27,Sheldon>还是说谎
<9-27,Sheldon>and that's a lie.

399
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,160
<9-28,Penny>真相到底是什么
<9-28,Penny>What is the truth?

400
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,740
<9-29,Sheldon>我的玩具史波克先生托梦给我
<9-29,Sheldon>My Mr. Spock doll came to me in a dream

401
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,220
<9-29,Sheldon>逼我拆开了盒子
<9-29,Sheldon>and forced me to open it.

402
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,140
<9-29,Sheldon>玩具坏掉以后  我就偷换了你的
<9-29,Sheldon>And when the toy broke, I switched it for yours.

403
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,150
<9-29,Sheldon>后来他鼓励我改正错误
<9-29,Sheldon>Later, he encouraged me to do the right thing,

404
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,690
<9-29,Sheldon>而我拒绝了他
<9-29,Sheldon>and I defied him.

405
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,980
<9-29,Sheldon>然后我就被葛恩追杀了
<9-29,Sheldon>And then I was attacked by a Gorn.

407
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,550
<9-30,Leonard>好吧  这个我信
<9-30,Leonard>Okay, that I believe.

408
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,490
<9-32,Sheldon>莱纳德  佩妮  我要对你们说
<9-32,Sheldon>Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know

409
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,060
<9-32,Sheldon>我很后悔之前对两位所做的事
<9-32,Sheldon>that I regret my actions towards the two of you.

410
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,310
<9-32,Sheldon>我又说谎了
<9-32,Sheldon>That's a lie.

411
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,910
<9-33,Leonard>这么说  那个是我的咯
<9-33,Leonard>So, is that one mine?

412
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,860
<9-35,Leonard>-是的  -那给我吧  我来拆开
<9-35,Leonard>- Yes. - Well, hand it over so I can open it.

413
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,220
<9-35,Leonard>好吧
<9-35,Leonard>Okay.

414
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,530
<9-36,Sheldon>莱纳德  虽然我的玩具坏了
<9-36,Sheldon>And, Leonard, even though I don't have one anymore,

415
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,350
<9-36,Sheldon>我还是希望你玩得开心
<9-36,Sheldon>I hope you have fun playing with it.

416
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,030
<9-38,Sheldon>-你又说谎了吧  -弥天大谎
<9-38,Sheldon>- And that's a lie, right? - It's a big, fat whopper.

417
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,150
<9-38,Sheldon>我真心希望这个是坏的
<9-38,Sheldon>I hope it breaks.

418
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,740
<10-1,Raj>欢迎大驾光临
<10-1,Raj>This is a treat.

419
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,760
<10-1,Raj>什么风把你们吹来了
<10-1,Raj>What brings you guys by?

420
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,160
<10-2,Bernadette>拉杰  华仔跟我说了你和拉希米的事
<10-2,Bernadette>Raj, Howie told me what's going on with you and Lakshmi.

421
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,640
<10-3,Raj>你居然告诉她了
<10-3,Raj>You told her?

422
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,420
<10-4,Howard>我还告诉所有人了呢
<10-4,Howard>I told everybody.

423
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,300
<10-5,Bernadette>我们相信你一定会找到一个真心爱你的人
<10-5,Bernadette>We believe there's someone out there who will love you for you.

424
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,090
<10-6,Howard>其实在这点上  我们各持不同意见
<10-6,Howard>Actually, we kind of agreed to disagree on that one,

425
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,480
<10-6,Howard>但我们一致认为  你不该跟她结婚
<10-6,Howard>but we both think you shouldn't marry this woman.

426
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,360
<10-7,Raj>所以当我在等待这个可能存在  也可能不存在的
<10-7,Raj>So, while I'm waiting for this mysterious perfect match

427
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,750
<10-7,Raj>神秘真命天女时  就该一直单身下去吗
<10-7,Raj>who may or may not exist, I'm supposed to just be alone?

428
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,500
<10-8,Bernadette>那倒未必
<10-8,Bernadette>Not necessarily.

429
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,700
<10-8,Bernadette>我们为你找了个可以相依偎的伴
<10-8,Bernadette>I think we found someone for you to cuddle with.

430
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,370
<10-9,Raj>我的老天
<10-9,Raj>Oh, my goodness.

431
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,590
<10-9,Raj>你可真是史上最可爱的小狗狗
<10-9,Raj>Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever!

432
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,260
<10-9,Raj>他真的是送我的吗
<10-9,Raj>You got him for me?

433
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,220
<10-10,Howard>是"她"  你俩肯定合得来
<10-10,Howard>Her. We thought you two would hit it off.

434
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,310
<10-11,Raj>我俩一拍即合
<10-11,Raj>I think we already have.

435
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,500
<10-11,Raj>太感谢你们了
<10-11,Raj>Thank you guys so much.

437
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,590
<10-11,Raj>来看看你能不能装进我男用手包里去
<10-11,Raj>Let's go see if you fit in my man purse.

438
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,400
<10-12,Bernadette>异性恋  骗谁呀
<10-12,Bernadette>Heterosexual, my ass.
