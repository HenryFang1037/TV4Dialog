<1-12,Howard>and hope to live long enough to see the movie

44
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,450
<1-12,Howard>看到由超帅气演员来扮演我们的传记电影
<1-12,Howard>based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.

45
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,280
<1-13,Sheldon>我肯定能活够久
<1-13,Sheldon>Yeah, I'll definitely live long enough--

46

<1-14,Leonard>明早第一件事 就是我们仨继续开工
<1-14,Leonard>First thing tomorrow morning, we're back at it.

48
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,830
<1-15,Raj>继续三缺一
<1-15,Raj>Without me.

49
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,790
<1-16,Sheldon>希望他这个角色不会被写进电影里
<1-16,Sheldon>I hope his character doesn't make it into the movie;

50
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,420
<1-16,Sheldon>太扫兴了
<1-16,Sheldon>he's kind of a bummer.

51
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,510
<2-1,Computer Voice>莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
<2-1,Computer Voice>Leonard Hofstadter.

52
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,300
<2-1,Computer Voice>允许进入
<2-1,Computer Voice>Access granted.

53
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,260
<2-2,Leonard>就算这玩意会烧掉我的视网膜也没关系
<2-2,Leonard>Hmm. I don't care if this thing's burning out my retinas;

54
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,760
<2-2,Leonard>它让人家感觉好特别
<2-2,Leonard>it makes me feel special.

55
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,720
<2-2,Leonard>在我们实地测试前 我们...
<2-2,Leonard>Now, before we field test, I think we...

56
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,060
<2-3,Howard>什么鬼
<2-3,Howard>What the hell?

57
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,100
<2-4,Leonard>东西都去哪了
<2-4,Leonard>Where is everything?

58
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,060
<2-5,Sheldon>还有谁有进入许可
<2-5,Sheldon>Who else has access to this room?

59
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,480
<2-6,Leonard>这是机密建筑里的安全实验室
<2-6,Leonard>It's a secure lab in a classified facility;

60
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,230
<2-6,Leonard>只有美国政府与我们才可进入
<2-6,Leonard>only the U.S. government and us.

61
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,070
<2-7,Sheldon>好令人不安啊
<2-7,Sheldon>This is very disconcerting.

62
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,990
<2-8,Howard>但我们的电影一下就精彩了起来
<2-8,Howard>But the movie did just get good.

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,810
<3-1,Leonard>长官 抱歉 但我就是想不明白
<3-1,Leonard>Sir, I-I-I'm sorry but I just don't get it.

74
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,940
<3-1,Leonard>你大半夜跑进我们的实验室
<3-1,Leonard>Y-You came into our lab in the middle of the night

75
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,770
<3-1,Leonard>拿走我们的原型机与实验成果
<3-1,Leonard>and took our prototype and all of our research

76
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,820
<3-1,Leonard>完全不知会我们一声吗
<3-1,Leonard>and didn't even tell us?

77
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,320
<3-2,Col. Williams>听起来你已经想明白了啊
<3-2,Col. Williams>Sounds like you get it.

78
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,360
<3-3,Howard>你为什么要这么做
<3-3,Howard>Well, why would you do that?

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,410
<3-4,Col. Williams>你们完成了第一阶段 剩下的我们来接手就行
<3-4,Col. Williams>You guys completed phase one, we'll take it from here.

80
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,910
<3-5,Sheldon>你把东西转移到哪里了
<3-5,Sheldon>Where did you move it?

81
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,370
<3-6,Col. Williams>无可奉告
<3-6,Col. Williams>I can't tell you that.

82
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,660
<3-7,Leonard>你要施行第二阶段计划吗
<3-7,Leonard>Are you implementing phase two?

83
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,170
<3-6,Col. Williams>无可奉告
<3-6,Col. Williams>I can't tell you that.

84
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,830
<3-9,Sheldon>所以你打算抢走我们
<3-9,Sheldon>Wait, so you're just going to take all the work

85
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,920
<3-9,Sheldon>去年一整年的成果 然后把我们一脚踢开
<3-9,Sheldon>we've done for the last year and toss us aside?

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,880
<3-10,Col>这个我能告诉你们 是的
<3-10,Col>That one I can tell you, yes.

87
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,180
<3-11,Howard>这好令人伤心啊
<3-11,Howard>This is all very upsetting.

88
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,640
<4-2,Penny>听到你伤心我也很遗憾
<4-2,Penny>I'm sorry to hear that.

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,430
<3-12,Col. Williams>毕竟美国军方的主要焦点就放在
<3-12,Col. Williams>As you know, the primary focus of the United States military

90
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,770
<3-12,Col. Williams>照顾人民情感上了
<3-12,Col. Williams>is people's feelings.

91
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,690
<3-13,Sheldon>如果你是在讽刺 请留去讽刺我国的敌人
<3-13,Sheldon>If that's sarcasm, please save it for our enemies.

92
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,570
<4-1,Raj>我可能很快就搬走了
<4-1,Raj>Well, I may be moving out soon.

93
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,860
<4-1,Raj>我找到地方住了
<4-1,Raj>I think I found a place to live.

94
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,820
<4-2,Penny>真不想听到你要搬走
<4-2,Penny>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

95
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,610
<4-2,Penny>真心的吗
<4-2,Penny>Really?

96
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,830
<4-3,Raj>你一直给我发公寓租赁广告
<4-3,Raj>You kept sending me apartment listings.

97
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,120
<4-4,Penny>这个嘛 我...
<4-4,Penny>Um... well, I...

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,290
<4-4,Penny>好吧 我无力反驳
<4-4,Penny>yeah, you got me.

99
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,170
<4-5,Amy>你要搬去哪里
<4-5,Amy>Where are you moving?

100
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,500
<4-6,Penny>什么时候搬 还有搬去哪里
<4-6,Penny>And when? But a-also where?

101
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,340
<4-7,Raj>伯特有一间房出租
<4-7,Raj>Bert has a room for rent.

102
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,920
<4-8,Bernadette>所以你要跟伯特当室友吗
<4-8,Bernadette>So you're gonna be roommates with Bert?

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,470
<4-9,Raj>不是 其实那房间挺私密的
<4-9,Raj>Uh, no, it's, uh, pretty private, actually,

104
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,630
<4-9,Raj>在他的车库楼上
<4-9,Raj>it's over his garage.

105
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,800
<4-9,Raj>所以我唯一会见到他的时间是他停车进来
<4-9,Raj>So the only time I'll see him is when he pulls his car in,

106
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,390
<4-9,Raj>洗衣服或在我餐厅练鼓的时候
<4-9,Raj>does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.

107
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,770
<4-10,Amy>那挺好的
<4-10,Amy>Well, good for you. Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,310
<4-10,Amy>箕实我也有个消息要分享
<4-10,Amy>I actually have a little news myself.

109
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,730
<4-11,Penny>好吧 话题会回到他什么时候搬走吗
<4-11,Penny>Okay, we're just gonna circle back to when he's moving out?

110
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,480
<4-11,Penny>算了 没关系
<4-11,Penny>Okay, that's cool.

111
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,150
<4-12,Amy>我受邀赴普林斯顿大学任访问学者
<4-12,Amy>I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton.

112
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,030
<4-13,Bernadette>太厉害了
<4-13,Bernadette>Hey, that's amazing.

113
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,820
<4-14,Penny>- 真棒  - 恭喜你
<4-14,Penny>- Good for you.  - Congratulations.

114
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,780
<4-16,Amy>谢谢 但问题是我得离开几个月
<4-16,Amy>Thanks, but the thing is I'll be gone for a few months

115
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,070
<4-16,Amy>我不知道谢尔顿会对此作何感想
<4-16,Amy>and I don't know how Sheldon's gonna feel about that.

116
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,080
<4-17,Penny>拜托 他是个成年人 完全可以照顾自己
<4-17,Penny>Oh, come on, he's a grown man, he can take care of himself.

117
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,250
<4-18,Amy>你真的这么认为吗
<4-18,Amy>You really believe that?

118
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,580
<4-19,Penny>我再次无力反驳
<4-19,Penny>Once again, you got me.

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,380
<5-1,Howard>你努力了一年的心血
<5-1,Howard>How can you work on something for a year

120
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,420
<5-1,Howard>他们怎么可以就这样夺走
<5-1,Howard>and they just take it?

121
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,720
<5-2,Leonard>真不敢相信美国空军会这样对我们
<5-2,Leonard>I can't believe the Air Force would treat us like that.

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,720
<5-3,Sheldon>我很想从今天开始不再交税
<5-3,Sheldon>You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes.

123
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,930
<5-3,Sheldon>我超享受计算税费的过程 可惜了
<5-3,Sheldon>It's too bad I enjoy doing them so much.

124
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,020
<5-3,Sheldon>美国空军又出手了
<5-3,Sheldon>The Air Force did it again.

125
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,690
<5-3,Sheldon>他们要抹去我们的生活
<5-3,Sheldon>They're erasing our lives!

126
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,900
<5-4,Leonard>这是三楼 走错公寓了
<5-4,Leonard>Third floor, wrong apartment.

127
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
<5-5,Howard>不过如果有人要把你们公寓清空
<5-5,Howard>Although, if anyone's gonna clean out your apartment

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,120
<5-5,Howard>然后消失 那人一定是佩妮
<5-5,Howard>and disappear, it'd be Penny.

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,370
<5-6,Leonard>她可能会消失
<5-6,Leonard>She might disappear,

130
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,620
<5-6,Leonard>但要想她会清任何东西 那是不可能的
<5-6,Leonard>but she's definitely not cleaning anything.

131
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,920
<6-1,Sheldon>没事 一切都在
<6-1,Sheldon>It's okay, everything's here.

132
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,590
<6-2,Penny>发生什么事了
<6-2,Penny>Oh, hey, what's going on?

133
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,340
<6-3,Leonard>说了你们也不会信
<6-3,Leonard>You won't believe it;

134
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,590
<6-3,Leonard>军方没收了我们整个项目
<6-3,Leonard>the military confiscated our project.

135
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,760
<6-5,Bernadette>- 什么  - 开玩笑吧
<6-5,Bernadette>- What?  - You're kidding.

136
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
<6-5,Bernadette>他们为什么要这么做
<6-5,Bernadette>Why would they do that?

137
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,390
<6-6,Howard>无可奉告
<6-6,Howard>They wouldn't say.

138
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,020
<6-7,Sheldon>我深深地觉得被背叛了
<6-7,Sheldon>I feel so betrayed.

139
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,480
<6-7,Sheldon>我此生一直以为山姆大叔[美国政府]是
<6-7,Sheldon>You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle

140
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,940
<6-7,Sheldon>友好会送人礼物那种大叔
<6-7,Sheldon>who brought you presents.

141
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,480
<6-7,Sheldon>结果他恰怡相反
<6-7,Sheldon>Turns out he's the other kind.

142
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,440
<6-8,Amy>谢尔顿 真是太遗憾了
<6-8,Amy>Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

143
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,320
<6-9,Sheldon>多谢关心 我们能聊点别的吗
<6-9,Sheldon>Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?

144
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,030
<6-10,Leonard>对啊 你们有什么消息要分享吗
<6-10,Leonard>Yeah, what's going on with you guys?

145
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,660
<6-11,Howard>给我们来点好消息
<6-11,Howard>Give us some good news.

146
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,200
<6-12,Penny>艾米有话说
<6-12,Penny>Amy's got some news.

147
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,120
<6-13,Amy>是的
<6-13,Amy>Yeah, um...

148
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,880
<6-13,Amy>拉杰要搬走了
<6-13,Amy>Raj is moving out.

149
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,290
<6-14,Leonard>不要啊
<6-14,Leonard>Oh, no.

150
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,750
<6-14,Leonard>什么时候
<6-14,Leonard>When?

151
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,340
<7-1,Bernadette>你还好吧
<7-1,Bernadette>You doing okay?

152
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,840
<7-2,Howard>不好
<7-2,Howard>Not really.

153
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,140
<7-3,Bernadette>用我给你放尼尔·戴蒙德的歌吗
<7-3,Bernadette>Want me to put on some Neil Diamond?

154
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,810
<7-3,Bernadette>你每次听了都会开心点
<7-3,Bernadette>That always makes you feel better.

155
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,600
<7-3,Bernadette>不用了
<7-3,Bernadette>No.

156
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,150
<7-4,Howard>你听一听就会开始发情 而我现在没心情
<7-4,Howard>Then you'll get all sexed up and I'm not in the mood.

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,360
<7-4,Howard>整整一年都白费了
<7-4,Howard>I mean, an entire year wasted.

158
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
<7-5,Bernadette>你或许忘记了去年你还有一项成就
<7-5,Bernadette>You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.

159
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,700
<7-6,Howard>是是是 我们还将一个小生命带来人世
<7-6,Howard>Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world.

160
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,870
<7-6,Howard>不是吧
<7-6,Howard>Really?

161
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,080
<7-7,Bernadette>你就这么形容我们生孩子的重要性吗
<7-7,Bernadette>That's the importance you put on us having a baby?

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,950
<7-8,Howard>我对此当然开心啊 但我又没怎么出力
<7-8,Howard>I'm happy about it, but, I mean, it's not like I did much.

163
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,160
<7-8,Howard>我是说 前三分钟过后
<7-8,Howard>I mean, after the first three minutes

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,710
<7-8,Howard>剩下的都是你的功劳
<7-8,Howard>it was pretty much all you.

165
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,300
<8-1,Penny (on phone)>你跟他说了去普林斯顿大学的事了吗
<8-1,Penny (on phone)>So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?

166
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,220
<8-2,Amy>还没 我想等他心情好时再说
<8-2,Amy>No, I'm waiting till he's in a good mood.

167
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,550
<8-3,Penny>亲爱的 那你可能活不到那个时候
<8-3,Penny>Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.

168
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,430
<8-4,Amy>我不知道 或许我不该走
<8-4,Amy>I don't know, maybe I shouldn't go.

169
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,430
<8-5,Penny>别闹了 他会没事的
<8-5,Penny>Oh, stop it, he'll be fine.

170
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,310
<8-6,Amy>应该吧
<8-6,Amy>I guess.

171
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,230
<8-6,Amy>反正他还有你和莱纳德
<8-6,Amy>And he'll have you and Leonard

172
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,310
<8-6,Amy>你们就住在对门
<8-6,Amy>right across the hall the whole time.

173
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,810
<8-6,Amy>糟糕 等等 或许你不该走
<8-6,Amy>Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn't go...

174
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,860
<8-7,Amy>挂了啊
<8-7,Amy>Got to go.

175
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,940
<8-7,Amy>早上好
<8-7,Amy>Morning.

176
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,660
<8-8,Sheldon>我为占用超过分配好的如厕时间道歉
<8-8,Sheldon>I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.

177
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,740
<8-9,Amy>你还好吗
<8-9,Amy>Are you feeling okay?

178
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,120
<8-9,Amy>不好
<8-9,Amy>Not really.

179
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,250
<8-10,Sheldon>显然悲伤会影响人如厕的规律性
<8-10,Sheldon>Apparently grief can make one less regular.

180
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,040
<8-11,Amy>听到这个消息我也很难过
<8-11,Amy>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

181
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,920
<8-12,Sheldon>我坐在马桶上等了又等 但徒劳无功
<8-12,Sheldon>No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.

182
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,800
<8-13,Amy>细节越多 我越难过
<8-13,Amy>Oh, the-the more details, the more sorry.

183
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,970
<8-13,Amy>或许这个能让你开心一点
<8-13,Amy>Well, maybe this'll cheer you up.

184
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,140
<8-13,Amy>我做了你最喜欢的燕麦片
<8-13,Amy>I made your favorite oatmeal...

185
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,760
<9-2,Amy>什么都没加
<9-2,Amy>plain.

186
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,560
<8-14,Sheldon>今天是什么好日子啊
<8-14,Sheldon>What's the occasion?

187
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,900
<8-15,Amy>没什么 我只是想做点让你开心的事
<8-15,Amy>No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you.

188
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,810
<8-16,Sheldon>你人真好
<8-16,Sheldon>You're so kind.

189
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,940
<8-16,Sheldon>真不知道认识你之前 我是怎么活过来的
<8-16,Sheldon>You know, I don't know how I ever got by without you.

190
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,030
<8-17,Amy>你嘴真甜 但你之前一个人也活得好好的
<8-17,Amy>That's sweet, but you... you did just fine on your own.

191
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,200
<8-18,Sheldon>我本来也以为是这样
<8-18,Sheldon>Well, I thought that, too,

192
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,870
<8-18,Sheldon>但我逐渐意识到 我对你十分依赖
<8-18,Sheldon>but I've come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.

193
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,500
<8-19,Amy>谢尔顿 说什么傻话
<8-19,Amy>Sheldon, you're, you're being silly.

194
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,340
<8-20,Sheldon>不 每天早上醒来 知道你在身边
<8-20,Sheldon>No, to wake up every morning and know you're there

195
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,050
<8-20,Sheldon>我都感到很安心
<8-20,Sheldon>is a great comfort to me.

196
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,760
<8-20,Sheldon>寡淡无味
<8-20,Sheldon>Mmm, tasteless.

197
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,560
<8-20,Sheldon>你手艺怎么那么巧
<8-20,Sheldon>How do you do it?

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,640
<8-21,Amy>你现在要做的就是
<8-21,Amy>You know, what you need to do is

199
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,560
<8-21,Amy>忘掉这个空军项目
<8-21,Amy>put this Air Force project behind you

200
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,980
<8-21,Amy>把精力投入新的研究
<8-21,Amy>and just dive into something new.

201
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,150
<8-22,Sheldon>倒是可以投入我们的量子认知试验
<8-22,Sheldon>Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment.

202
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,820
<8-22,Sheldon>我和你可以多花点时间在那上面
<8-22,Sheldon>You and I could spend more time on that.

203
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,530
<8-23,Amy>我说不好
<8-23,Amy>Oh, I don't know,

204
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,820
<8-23,Amy>就算我们成功证明了
<8-23,Amy>I mean, let's say we succeed in proving

205
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,530
<8-23,Amy>我们的意识创造现实
<8-23,Amy>that our consciousness creates reality.

206
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,200
<8-23,Amy>那也算不上什么伟大成就
<8-23,Amy>I mean, what will we have really accomplished?

207
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,040
<8-23,Amy>一块面包还是卖三块钱啊
<8-23,Amy>You know, a loaf of bread's still three bucks.

208
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,830
<8-24,Sheldon>我不懂了
<8-24,Sheldon>I'm confused.

209
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,380
<8-24,Sheldon>是你总说希望有更多时间和我相处
<8-24,Sheldon>You're always saying that you want to spend more time with me.

210
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,250
<8-25,Amy>对 我是这么说过
<8-25,Amy>That is true, I have said that.

211
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,550
<8-26,Sheldon>你整天说 真的很烦
<8-26,Sheldon>Well, a lot, it's very annoying.

212
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,300
<8-26,Sheldon>发生什么变化了吗
<8-26,Sheldon>Has something changed?

213
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,930
<8-26,Sheldon>你是不是有事瞒着我
<8-26,Sheldon>Um, is there something that you're not telling me?

214
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,600
<8-27,Amy>我得到了普林斯顿大学的夏季研究奖学金
<8-27,Amy>I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.

215
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,770
<8-27,Amy>普林斯顿吗
<8-27,Amy>Princeton?

216
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,530
<8-28,Sheldon>很不错的大学
<8-28,Sheldon>A fine institution.

217
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,200
<8-28,Sheldon>阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦教过书的地方
<8-28,Sheldon>The place where Albert Einstein taught.

218
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,360
<8-28,Sheldon>莱纳德也是在那里拿到博士学位
<8-28,Sheldon>And where Leonard got his PhD,

219
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,330
<8-28,Sheldon>所以那学校可能没落了
<8-28,Sheldon>so it may have gone downhill.

220
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,250
<8-29,Amy>对 就是那所
<8-29,Amy>Yeah, that's the one.

221
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,620
<8-30,Sheldon>这是很棒的消息
<8-30,Sheldon>Well, that's wonderful.

222
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,960
<8-30,Sheldon>恭喜你
<8-30,Sheldon>Congratulations.

223
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,380
<8-31,Amy>我还没接受
<8-31,Amy>Well, I-I haven't accepted it yet.

224
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,290
<8-31,Amy>我想先跟你商量一下
<8-31,Amy>I wanted to talk to you first.

225
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,460
<8-32,Sheldon>有什么好商量的
<8-32,Sheldon>Wh-What is there to talk about?

226
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,800
<8-32,Sheldon>你必须接受 这很重要
<8-32,Sheldon>You have to take it. It's important.

227
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,760
<8-33,Amy>你也很重要
<8-33,Amy>So are you.

228
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,300
<8-34,Sheldon>谢谢 但我不会有事的
<8-34,Sheldon>Thank you, but I'll be fine.

229
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,800
<8-35,Amy>你确定吗
<8-35,Amy>Are-are you sure?

230
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,180
<8-36,Sheldon>是的 虽然我可能失去了导向系统和女友
<8-36,Sheldon>Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend,

231
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,020
<8-36,Sheldon>但我结肠里还有昨天吃的食物
<8-36,Sheldon>but I still have a colon full of yesterday's meals

232
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,350
<8-36,Sheldon>陪伴着我
<8-36,Sheldon>to keep me company.

233
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,520
<8-36,Sheldon>不过 因为你做的高纤早餐
<8-36,Sheldon>Although, thanks to your high-fiber breakfast,

234
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,030
<8-36,Sheldon>它们很快也要离我而去了
<8-36,Sheldon>I'm sure that'll be leaving me, too.

235
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,290
<7-2,Howard>真的吗
<7-2,Howard>Really?

236
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,630
<9-1,Bernadette>他都不往里面加葡萄干或香蕉片那些吗
<9-1,Bernadette>He doesn't put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?

237
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,380
<9-2,Amy>我觉得纯燕麦不是这件事的重点
<9-2,Amy>I don't think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.

238
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,800
<9-3,Penny>我是喜欢加点红糖啦
<9-3,Penny>I mean, I like a little brown sugar...

239
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,970
<9-4,Amy>姐妹们
<9-4,Amy>Guys.

240
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,220
<9-5,Penny>- 抱歉  - 不好意思
<9-5,Penny>- Sorry   - Sorry.

241
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,890
<9-6,Bernadette>你还是会去吧
<9-6,Bernadette>You're still gonna go, right?

242
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,640
<9-6,Bernadette>我也不知道
<9-6,Bernadette>I don't know.

243
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,470
<9-7,Amy>谢尔顿现在那么脆弱
<9-7,Amy>Sheldon's so vulnerable right now.

244
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,520
<9-8,Penny>听着 如果你们角色调换
<9-8,Penny>Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed,

245
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,390
<9-8,Penny>他会马上坐第一班火车去新泽西
<9-8,Penny>he'd be on the first train to New Jersey,

246
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,480
<9-8,Penny>如果第一班上有青少年的话 他会搭第二班
<9-8,Penny>or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one.

247
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,610
<9-9,Bernadette>再说距离不见得是坏事啊
<9-9,Bernadette>Well, distance might be nice.

248
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,730
<9-9,Bernadette>上次华仔完成一个大型项目后
<9-9,Bernadette>The last time a big project ended for Howie,

249
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,490
<9-9,Bernadette>我到哪儿他都要跟着
<9-9,Bernadette>he wouldn't stop following me around.

250
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
<9-9,Bernadette>我去做乳腺X光检查他也要一起去
<9-9,Bernadette>He even went with me to get a mammogram.

251
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,780
<9-10,Penny>那有什么问题
<9-10,Penny>Well, what's wrong with that?

252
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,700
<9-11,Bernadette>他想跟我一起做检查
<9-11,Bernadette>No, he wanted to get one with me,

253
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,410
<9-11,Bernadette>跟某种诡异的情侣按摩似的
<9-11,Bernadette>like some kind of weird couple's massage.

254
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,040
<9-12,Penny>然而你还是给他生了孩子 厉害
<9-12,Penny>And yet you bore his child. Neato.

255
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,670
<9-13,Bernadette>你还是对这个机会感到兴奋的 对吧
<9-13,Bernadette>You're excited about this opportunity, right?

256
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,800
<9-14,Amy>当然了 我能成为第一组
<9-14,Amy>Of course. I get to be part of the first team

257
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,220
<9-14,Amy>使用氡标记来映射结构...
<9-14,Amy>to use radon markers to map the structures that...

258
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,260
<9-15,Penny>行了 说“是的”就够了
<9-15,Penny>Okay, a simple yes will do.

259
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,760
<9-16,Bernadette>你一定要去
<9-16,Bernadette>You have to go.

260
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,470
<9-17,Amy>我知道 可如果谢尔顿...
<9-17,Amy>I know, but what if Sheldon...

261
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,310
<9-18,Penny>听我说 就算分隔两地一阵子
<9-18,Penny>Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle

262
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,680
<9-18,Penny>你们俩的感情也不会受影响
<9-18,Penny>being long distance for a while.

263
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,730
<9-18,Penny>你们俩本来“亲密”接触也不多
<9-18,Penny>It's not like you two are very physical.

264
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,980
<9-19,Amy>你又不知道我们关起门来都干了什么
<9-19,Amy>Hey, you don't know what goes on behind closed doors.

265
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,060
<9-20,Penny>总给你讲课吗
<9-20,Penny>A lot of lectures?

266
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,770
<9-21,Amy>看来你还真知道
<9-21,Amy>All right, so you know.

267
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,440
<9-22,Bernadette>相信我 如果你不去
<9-22,Bernadette>I'm telling you, if you don't go

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,900
<9-22,Bernadette>你会后悔一辈子
<9-22,Bernadette>you'll end up regretting it.

269
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,820
<9-23,Howard>- 等等我  - 又来了
<9-23,Howard>- Wait up!  - Oh, great.

270
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,910
<9-25,Howard>你有东西忘记带了哦
<9-25,Howard>You left something at home.

271
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,910
<9-25,Howard>人家的爱心大抱抱
<9-25,Howard>A big hug! Oh!

272
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,750
<9-27,Howard>还有人家的爱心小亲亲
<9-27,Howard>I found it right next to these kisses.

273
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,500
<9-28,Bernadette>我已经没救了
<9-28,Bernadette>It's too late for me.

274
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,840
<9-28,Bernadette>你快逃吧
<9-28,Bernadette>Save yourself.

275
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,180
<10-1,Leonard>又要有自己的窝了 开心吗
<10-1,Leonard>So, are you excited to have your own place again?

276
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,590
<10-2,Raj>开心 不过我会想你们的
<10-2,Raj>I am, but I'll miss you guys.

277
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,140
<10-3,Leonard>我们也会想你的
<10-3,Leonard>Ah, we'll miss you, too.

278
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,890
<10-4,Raj>那... 你说这话时能把那抹窃笑抑制住吗
<10-4,Raj>Wha... you could try saying that without smiling.

279
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,140
<10-5,Leonard>我努力过了 实在是忍不住呀
<10-5,Leonard>I'm trying. This is the best I can do.

280
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,570
<10-5,Leonard>你在干什么
<10-5,Leonard>What are you doing?

281
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,240
<10-6,Sheldon>你们看起来这像什么
<10-6,Sheldon>What does it look like?

282
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,910
<10-6,Sheldon>我在吹奏悲伤的口琴曲
<10-6,Sheldon>I'm playing sad harmonica...

283
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,580
<10-6,Sheldon>在一间四壁空空犹如我心空空的公寓里
<10-6,Sheldon>in an apartment as empty as my heart.

284
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,250
<10-7,Raj>发生什么事了
<10-7,Raj>Why?

285
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,880
<10-8,Sheldon>人家忧郁了
<10-8,Sheldon>I got the blues.

286
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,380
<10-8,Sheldon>我的宝贝要离我而去
<10-8,Sheldon>My baby done left me.

287
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,920
<10-9,Raj>拜托 谢尔顿
<10-9,Raj>Come on, Sheldon.

288
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,050
<10-9,Raj>艾米不过是去几个月而已
<10-9,Raj>Amy's only gone for a few months.

289
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,470
<10-9,Raj>现在我搬走了 你的旧房间也空出来了
<10-9,Raj>And now that I'm moving out, your old room is empty,

290
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,560
<10-9,Raj>你随时随地都可以回去住啊
<10-9,Raj>so you can stay there whenever you want.

291
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,600
<10-10,Leonard>能和你在过道上聊两句吗
<10-10,Leonard>Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?

292
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,020
<10-11,Raj>可以呀
<10-11,Raj>Yeah, sure.

293
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,320
<10-12,Leonard>谢尔顿 你别犯傻了
<10-12,Leonard>Sheldon, you're being silly.

294
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,480
<10-12,Leonard>我在犯傻吗
<10-12,Leonard>Am I?

295
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,240
<10-13,Sheldon>昨天我还在负责空军项目
<10-13,Sheldon>Yesterday I had an Air Force project,

296
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,820
<10-13,Sheldon>有个同居的女友
<10-13,Sheldon>a girlfriend who lived with me,

297
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,870
<10-13,Sheldon>好朋友拉杰就住在我对门
<10-13,Sheldon>and my good friend Raj right across the hall.

298
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,540
<10-14,Leonard>你真的在意最后这一点吗
<10-14,Leonard>Do you really care about that last one?

299
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,710
<10-15,Sheldon>不在意 他是给我这单子凑数的
<10-15,Sheldon>No, but that list was sounding a little thin.

300
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,330
<10-16,Leonard>别光想不好的事 换个角度看问题
<10-16,Leonard>Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this.

301
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,040
<10-16,Leonard>你的女朋友得到了如此珍贵的机会
<10-16,Leonard>Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity,

302
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,840
<10-16,Leonard>也让你可以借机向她
<10-16,Leonard>which gives you an opportunity

303
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,340
<10-16,Leonard>展现你是个能给她爱与支持的男友
<10-16,Leonard>to show her that you're a loving and supportive boyfriend.

304
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,430
<10-17,Sheldon>所以要唬弄她
<10-17,Sheldon>So trick her.

305
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,060
<10-18,Leonard>让我重新说一遍
<10-18,Leonard>All right, let me start again.

306
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,890
<10-18,Leonard>你和艾米
<10-18,Leonard>Uh... you and Amy...

307
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,270
<10-19,Raj (outside)>我能先把东西拿出来吗
<10-19,Raj (outside)>Can I get my stuff?

308
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,860
<10-19,Raj (outside)>听起来你们还得聊好长一段时间呢
<10-19,Raj (outside)>Sounds like it's gonna be a while.

309
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,990
<11-1,Howard>人家好想你
<11-1,Howard>I missed you.

310
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,950
<11-2,Bernadette>过来 我们聊聊
<11-2,Bernadette>Come here, let's talk.

311
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,080
<11-3,Howard>听起来很严重
<11-3,Howard>Ooh. Sounds serious.

312
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,540
<11-3,Howard>是我做错事了吗
<11-3,Howard>Have I been a bad boy?

313
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,410
<11-3,Howard>你要打人家的小屁股了吗
<11-3,Howard>Am I gonna get a spanking

314
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,000
<11-3,Howard>- 你知道我...  - 安静 听我说
<11-3,Howard>- 'cause you know I...  - Just listen.

315
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,460
<11-4,Bernadette>我不知道你有没有发现
<11-4,Bernadette>I don't know if you realize this,

316
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,300
<11-4,Bernadette>但每次你手上没有项目时
<11-4,Bernadette>but whenever you're between projects,

317
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,130
<11-4,Bernadette>你就变得没有安全感
<11-4,Bernadette>you tend to get a little insecure.

318
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,760
<11-6,Bernadette>有点黏人
<11-6,Bernadette>Oh. A little clingy.

319
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,970
<11-7,Howard>我知道 人家错错啦
<11-7,Howard>I know and I'm sorry.

320
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,850
<11-8,Bernadette>好了好了 住手
<11-8,Bernadette>Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop.

321
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,010
<11-8,Bernadette>停下来
<11-8,Bernadette>Stop.

322
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,390
<11-8,Bernadette>我喜欢你情深款款的时候
<11-8,Bernadette>I love when you're affectionate,

323
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,980
<11-8,Bernadette>但你这不是正常的反应
<11-8,Bernadette>but this is not coming from a good place.

324
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,480
<11-9,Howard>哎哟喂
<11-9,Howard>Well, excuse me,

325
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,110
<11-9,Howard>那你上次花了两年时间研发过敏药
<11-9,Howard>but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug

326
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,940
<11-9,Howard>最后研究却被药监局枪毙时呢
<11-9,Howard>for two years and the FDA shut down your project?

327
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,910
<11-10,Bernadette>我替咱俩报名了交际舞的课
<11-10,Bernadette>I signed us up for ballroom dance class.

328
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,280
<11-11,Howard>很好 还有你那一次
<11-11,Howard>Okay, and what did you do

329
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,950
<11-11,Howard>被踢出抗真菌团队的时候呢
<11-11,Howard>when they took you off the antifungal team?

330
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,420
<11-12,Bernadette>我逼着你让我怀孕了
<11-12,Bernadette>I made us have a baby.

331
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,960
<11-13,Howard>所以结论是
<11-13,Howard>So?

332
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,010
<11-14,Bernadette>放马过来吧
<11-14,Bernadette>Bring it in.

333
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,550
<11-15,Howard>本电影刚刚被评为限制级
<11-15,Howard>And now the movie just got rated "R."

334
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,140
<12-1,Amy>你要去哪里吗
<12-1,Amy>You going somewhere?

335
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,850
<12-2,Sheldon>不是 你要走
<12-2,Sheldon>No, but you are,

336
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,400
<12-2,Sheldon>所以我送你这个作为礼物
<12-2,Sheldon>so I got you this as a present.

337
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,480
<12-3,Amy>谢尔顿 你不用这么做
<12-3,Amy>Sheldon, that isn't necessary.

338
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
<12-4,Sheldon>不 我需要
<12-4,Sheldon>No, it is.

339
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,690
<12-4,Sheldon>莱纳德告诉我
<12-4,Sheldon>Leonard pointed out to me

340
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,110
<12-4,Sheldon>我并不是一个时常能给予你爱与支持的男朋友
<12-4,Sheldon>that I'm not always a loving and supportive boyfriend,

341
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,950
<12-4,Sheldon>所以我给你买了高质量的行李箱
<12-4,Sheldon>so here's some quality luggage.

342
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,410
<12-5,Amy>谢谢
<12-5,Amy>Thank you.

343
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,370
<12-6,Sheldon>售货员说坠机这箱子都不会摔坏 所以...
<12-6,Sheldon>The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so...

344
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,590
<12-6,Sheldon>也许你应该坐在箱子里面飞
<12-6,Sheldon>Perhaps you should fly inside it.

345
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,550
<12-7,Amy>这是说你同意我离开吗
<12-7,Amy>Does this mean you're okay with me going?

346
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,390
<12-8,Sheldon>我并不期待
<12-8,Sheldon>Well, I'm not looking forward to it,

347
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,760
<12-8,Sheldon>但这是千载难逢的机会
<12-8,Sheldon>but it is a wonderful opportunity

348
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,520
<12-8,Sheldon>你必须接受
<12-8,Sheldon>and you need to take it.

349
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,690
<12-8,Sheldon>而且普林斯顿在新泽西
<12-8,Sheldon>Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey,

350
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,980
<12-8,Sheldon>所以我也不用怕你想落地生根
<12-8,Sheldon>so it's not like you're gonna want to stay.

351
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,700
<12-8,Sheldon>我知道今天不是你的生日
<12-8,Sheldon>Uh, I know it's not your birthday,

352
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,610
<12-8,Sheldon>但如果你有性趣...
<12-8,Sheldon>but if you're interested...

353
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,410
<12-9,Amy>- 我有  - 好
<12-9,Amy>- I am.  - Okay.

354
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,870
<12-10,Sheldon>我得说清楚
<12-10,Sheldon>Oh, and just to be clear,

355
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,580
<12-10,Sheldon>我和你亲热并不是为了把你留下
<12-10,Sheldon>I'm not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.

356
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,960
<12-11,Amy>我没这样想
<12-11,Amy>I wasn't thinking that.

357
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,340
<12-12,Sheldon>不 我只是警告你
<12-12,Sheldon>Well, no, it's just, I'm just warning you, you know,

358
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,840
<12-12,Sheldon>当你发现自己在五千公里之外
<12-12,Sheldon>if you find yourself 3,000 miles away

359
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,340
<12-12,Sheldon>渴望得到这诱人的身躯
<12-12,Sheldon>and craving a-a hit of this, you know...

360
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,890
<12-12,Sheldon>我不能通过视频给你
<12-12,Sheldon>...I can't Skype it to you.

361
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,390
<12-13,Amy>我愿意冒这个险
<12-13,Amy>That's a risk I'm willing to take.

362
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,100
<12-14,Sheldon>那好吧
<12-14,Sheldon>All right, then.

363
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,980
<12-14,Sheldon>我们进卧室除去衣衫
<12-14,Sheldon>Let's go to the bedroom, remove our clothes,

364
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,480
<12-14,Sheldon>叠得整整齐齐
<12-14,Sheldon>fold them neatly...

365
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,490
<12-14,Sheldon>再开始狂野性爱
<12-14,Sheldon>...and engage in frenzied lovemaking.

366
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,790
<12-15,Amy>如果我们不叠衣服呢
<12-15,Amy>What if we don't fold our clothes at all?

367
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,660
<12-15,Amy>我...或者
<12-15,Amy>I d... or...

<12-16,Sheldon>如果我们叠起来呢
<12-16,Sheldon>what if we fold them?

<13-11,Penny>我想 但我做不到
<13-11,Penny>I want to, but I don't think I can.

<14-1,Amy>Do you want to walk me downstairs?

387
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:09,920
<14-1,Amy>当然
<14-1,Amy>Of course.

388
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,420
<14-2,Sheldon>让我来拿
<14-2,Sheldon>Here, here, let me.

389
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,000
<14-2,Sheldon>我对新泽西做了下调研
<14-2,Sheldon>I've been doing a little research on New Jersey,

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,670
<14-2,Sheldon>我很高兴地得知
<14-2,Sheldon>and I was delighted to learn

391
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,760
<14-2,Sheldon>他们的主要农产品是草皮
<14-2,Sheldon>that their chief agricultural product is sod.

392
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,180
<14-3,Amy>- 是吗  - 没错
<14-3,Amy>- Is it?  - Hmm, yes.

393
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,390
<14-4,Sheldon>也许我以前对他们的态度太严厉了
<14-4,Sheldon>Yeah, perhaps I've been harder on them than they deserve.

394
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,270
<14-5,Amy>你觉得有没可能
<14-5,Amy>Do you think it's possible

395
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,020
<14-5,Amy>你会享受一段独处的时光呢
<14-5,Amy>you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?

396
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,110
<14-6,Sheldon>很难说
<14-6,Sheldon>It's hard to say.

397
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,190
<14-6,Sheldon>我从来没真正一个人住过
<14-6,Sheldon>I've never really lived by myself.

398
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,110
<14-6,Sheldon>如果我变得古怪又神经怎么办
<14-6,Sheldon>What if I become strange and eccentric?

399
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,200
<14-7,Amy>无论怎样我都爱你
<14-7,Amy>I'll love you no matter what.

400
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,290
<14-8,Sheldon>比如霍华德·休斯把自己的尿存在牛奶瓶里
<14-8,Sheldon>Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.

402
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,090
<14-9,Amy>真有这天 船到桥头自然直
<14-9,Amy>We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

403
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,260
<14-10,Sheldon>- 你到机场后会发短信给我吗  - 会
<14-10,Sheldon>- And you'll text me when you arrive at the airport?  - I will

404
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,330
<14-12,Sheldon>到登机口也会吗
<14-12,Sheldon>And when you're at the gate.

405
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,510
<14-14,Sheldon>如果你在头等舱看到《权力的游戏》里的演员呢
<14-14,Sheldon>And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?

406
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,730
<14-15,Amy>我不知道他们的样子 不过我会的
<14-15,Amy>I don't know what they look like, but sure.

407
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,060
<14-16,Sheldon>- 到了后别忘跟我视频  - 好的
<14-16,Sheldon>- And don't forget to Skype me when you arrive.  - I won't

408
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,300
<14-18,Sheldon>- 每天早上  - 明白
<14-18,Sheldon>- And every morning.  - Got it.

409
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,690
<14-20,Sheldon>当然 我这边9点 你那边已经是中午了
<14-20,Sheldon>Now of course, my 9:00 a.m. is your noon,

410
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,110
<14-20,Sheldon>咱们直接避免“早上好”
<14-20,Sheldon>so let's avoid the whole "good morning,"

411
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,110
<14-20,Sheldon>“中午好”的误区
<14-20,Sheldon>"good afternoon" minefield,

412
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,320
<14-20,Sheldon>直接说“你好”吧
<14-20,Sheldon>and let's just say, "Hello."

413
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,150
<14-21,Amy>想得真周到
<14-21,Amy>Good thinking.

414
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,240
<14-22,Sheldon>记住 我为你感到骄傲
<14-22,Sheldon>And just remember, I am proud of you

415
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,280
<14-22,Sheldon>你做什么我都支持你
<14-22,Sheldon>and I support you in all that you do.

416
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,790
<14-23,Amy>谢谢你 意义重大
<14-23,Amy>Thank you. That means a lot.

417
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,910
<14-24,Sheldon>还有一件事
<14-24,Sheldon>Oh, and one last thing.

418
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,790
<14-24,Sheldon>如果你在工作中碰到一位男性科学家
<14-24,Sheldon>If you find yourself working with a male scientist

419
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,460
<14-24,Sheldon>他和我一样聪明 一样高大
<14-24,Sheldon>who's as smart as me, as tall as me

420
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,170
<14-24,Sheldon>留着雷神索尔的发型
<14-24,Sheldon>and has hair like Thor,

421
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,380
<14-24,Sheldon>我要你马上远离现场
<14-24,Sheldon>well, then I want you to step away from the situation
