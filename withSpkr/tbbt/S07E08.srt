<1-2,Leonard>我刚认识你们时这飞镖靶就在这了
<1-2,Leonard>You've had this dart board since I've known you,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,050
<1-3,Penny>但我从没见你们玩过啊
<1-3,Penny>but I've never seen you play.

00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,390
<1-4,Leonard>我们玩过啊  就一次
<1-4,Leonard>Oh, uh, we played... once.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,240
<1-4,Leonard>我把窗户弄破了
<1-4,Leonard>I broke a window.

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,540
<1-6,Leonard>-哪个窗户  -那边的那扇
<1-6,Leonard>- What window? - That one over there.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,810
<1-7,Sheldon>莱纳德  游乐场点卷上哪去了
<1-7,Sheldon>Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,870
<1-8,Leonard>什么点卷
<1-8,Leonard>Skee-Ball tickets?

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,330
<1-9,Sheldon>我们三年前去游乐场时拿到的点卷啊
<1-9,Sheldon>Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago?

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,010
<1-9,Sheldon>我想好我要换什么奖品了
<1-9,Sheldon>I finally decided what prize I want.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,810
<1-9,Sheldon>快点啊
<1-9,Sheldon>Hurry up.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,230
<1-10,Leonard>如果我还有留着
<1-10,Leonard>Uh, if I still have them,

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,240
<1-10,Leonard>估计就放在这个垃圾收集盒里了
<1-10,Leonard>they're probably in the junk box.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,410
<1-11,Penny>你准备换什么呢
<1-11,Penny>Ooh, what are you gonna get?

15
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,810
<1-12,Sheldon>不关你的事
<1-12,Sheldon>None of your business.

16
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,480
<1-12,Sheldon>但如果之后你看到我的西装上
<1-12,Sheldon>But when you see me wearing a flower

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,540
<1-12,Sheldon>别了一朵花
<1-12,Sheldon>in my lapel later,

18
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,930
<1-12,Sheldon>欢迎你来闻闻
<1-12,Sheldon>you are most welcome to sniff it.

19

<1-14,Sheldon>去换个橡皮擦当你的辛苦费吧
<1-14,Sheldon>Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.

22
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,240
<1-15,Leonard>我都忘了这东西
<1-15,Leonard>I forgot about this.

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,500
<1-15,Leonard>我要去上大学时  阿姨做给我的
<1-15,Leonard>My aunt made it for me when I started college.

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,160
<1-16,Penny>她很讨厌你吗
<1-16,Penny>Aw, did she hate you?

25
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,890
<1-17,Leonard>怎么会  是因为我拿到又丑又痒的毛衣
<1-17,Leonard>Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater,

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,540
<1-17,Leonard>而我哥拿到一台车吗  她绝对"比较宠我"
<1-17,Leonard>and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.

27
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,290
<1-18,Sheldon>好像少了几张票
<1-18,Sheldon>Yeah, I seem to be a few tickets short.

28
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,740
<1-18,Sheldon>盒子里还有吗
<1-18,Sheldon>Are there more in the box?

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,700
<1-19,Leonard>应该都拿出来了吧
<1-19,Leonard>Hmm, I think I got them all.

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,290
<1-19,Leonard>没  里面没有了
<1-19,Leonard>Nope, they're not in there.

31
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,530
<1-20,Sheldon>你都没仔细找  我来吧
<1-20,Sheldon>Well, you barely looked. Let me see.

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,580
<1-21,Leonard>不用不用  我看过了
<1-21,Leonard>No, no, no, I-I looked, and...

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,150
<1-21,Leonard>里面没了
<1-21,Leonard>No more tickets.

34
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,750
<1-22,Sheldon>莱纳德  让我看看
<1-22,Sheldon>Leonard, let me look in the box.

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,140
<1-23,Leonard>别  别
<1-23,Leonard>Okay, okay!

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,170
<1-23,Leonard>我可以让你看箱子里有什么
<1-23,Leonard>I'm gonna show you what's in the box.

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,280
<1-23,Leonard>但你得答应你不能跳脚
<1-23,Leonard>but just... promise not to flip out.

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,810
<1-24,Sheldon>我为什么会跳脚
<1-24,Sheldon>Why would I flip out?

39
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,130
<1-24,Sheldon>是里面有蜘蛛吗
<1-24,Sheldon>Is it a spider?

40
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,550
<1-24,Sheldon>有蜘蛛
<1-24,Sheldon>It's a spider!

41
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,040
<1-25,Penny>不会是蜘蛛啦
<1-25,Penny>No, if it was a spider,

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,030
<1-25,Penny>有的话小莱莱早跳脚了
<1-25,Penny>Lenny would've flipped out.

43
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,620
<1-25,Penny>谢尔顿
<1-25,Penny>Okay, Sheldon,

44
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,500
<1-26,Leonard>我知道很久以前就该还这张DVD了
<1-26,Leonard>I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago,

45
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,740
<1-26,Leonard>我也知道这是用你的卡去租的
<1-26,Leonard>and I know we rented it on your card.

46
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,940
<1-26,Leonard>但这都过去七年了
<1-26,Leonard>But it's been, like, seven years

47
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,370
<1-26,Leonard>也没有任何不良后果
<1-26,Leonard>and clearly nothing bad has happened.

48
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,390
<1-26,Leonard>所以...  与其跟平常一样
<1-26,Leonard>So in-in-in-instead of being

49
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,010
<1-26,Leonard>使劲找我麻烦
<1-26,Leonard>a giant pain in the ass like you always are,

50
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,910
<1-26,Leonard>何不就一次
<1-26,Leonard>what if this one time

51
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,530
<1-26,Leonard>你试着保持冷静呢
<1-26,Leonard>you just tried staying calm?

52
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,630
<1-27,Sheldon>你这要求听起来颇为合理
<1-27,Sheldon>That seems like a reasonable request.

53
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,350
<1-27,Sheldon>但是我的要求也很合理  莱纳德兄
<1-27,Sheldon>Although so did, "Hey, Leonard,

54
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,890
<1-27,Sheldon>能否劳烦你去还个DVD呢
<1-27,Sheldon>would you mind returning that DVD?"

55
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,750
<1-28,Leonard>我错了  我会去处理这事
<1-28,Leonard>I'm sorry. I'll-Ill take care of it.

56
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,390
<1-29,Sheldon>好的
<1-29,Sheldon>Okay.

57
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,270
<1-30,Leonard>真心的  我会去处理
<1-30,Leonard>I mean it, I'm going to.

58
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,570
<1-31,Sheldon>我相信你啊
<1-31,Sheldon>I believe you.

59
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,840
<1-32,Leonard>你也会不生气  保持冷静吗
<1-32,Leonard>And you're going to stay calm?

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,890
<1-33,Sheldon>我说了我会
<1-33,Sheldon>I said I would.

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,220
<1-34,Leonard>看到没
<1-34,Leonard>How about that?

62
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,700
<1-34,Leonard>谢尔顿居然讲理了
<1-34,Leonard>Sheldon's being reasonable.

63
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,410
<1-35,Penny>对啊  有点吓到我了  我要走了
<1-35,Penny>Yeah, it's freaking me out. I'm gonna go.

67
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,840
<1-35,Penny>生活大爆炸
<1-35,Penny>第七季  第八集

68
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,940
<2-1,Leonard>所以  当你说你
<2-1,Leonard>So... when you say

69
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,470
<2-1,Leonard>不会为DVD的事情气得跳脚时
<2-1,Leonard>you're not going to freak out about the DVD,

70
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,900
<2-1,Leonard>是指这些意思吧
<2-1,Leonard>here's what that means.

71
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,980
<2-1,Leonard>你不会揪住这事不放
<2-1,Leonard>Don't fixate on it.

72
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,010
<2-1,Leonard>也不会半夜把我闹醒
<2-1,Leonard>Don't wake me up in the middle of the night.

73
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,820
<2-1,Leonard>或我在上厕所时
<2-1,Leonard>Or nag me through the door

74
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,760
<2-1,Leonard>在门外烦我
<2-1,Leonard>while I'm on the toilet.

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,300
<2-2,Sheldon>首先  在你上厕所时跟你说话
<2-2,Sheldon>Okay, first, talking to you while you're on the toilet

76
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,620
<2-2,Sheldon>对我来说也不是很愉快好吗
<2-2,Sheldon>isn't exactly a picnic for me either, okay?

77
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,030
<2-2,Sheldon>别忘了
<2-2,Sheldon>Remember...

78
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,850
<2-2,Sheldon>你听得到我的声音  我也听得到"你的"
<2-2,Sheldon>when you can hear me, I can hear you.

79
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,210
<2-2,Sheldon>第二
<2-2,Sheldon>And second...

80
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,670
<2-2,Sheldon>你完全忽视了
<2-2,Sheldon>you completely disregard

81
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,840
<2-2,Sheldon>悬而未决事情对我的闹心程度
<2-2,Sheldon>how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me.

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,940
<2-2,Sheldon>那感觉就像...
<2-2,Sheldon>It's-it's like, a...

83
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,890
<2-2,Sheldon>我脑子里有个挠不到的痒痒
<2-2,Sheldon>an itch in my brain I can't scratch.

84
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,140
<2-3,Leonard>我以前手臂打石膏时
<2-3,Leonard>When I broke my arm I used

85
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,520
<2-3,Leonard>痒了我就拿衣架子伸进去挠
<2-3,Leonard>to stick a coat hanger down there.

86
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,270
<2-3,Leonard>你试过吗  试试从你耳朵伸进去挠[请勿模仿]
<2-3,Leonard>You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?

87
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,750
<2-4,Sheldon>如果你能理解我  你就不会还在开玩笑了
<2-4,Sheldon>You wouldn't make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.

88
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,930
<2-5,Leonard>我不知道怎么理解你那感受啊
<2-5,Leonard>Well, I don't know how to do that.

89
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,890
<2-5,Leonard>这样吧
<2-5,Leonard>How about this?

90
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,280
<2-6,Sheldon>我答应你不烦你这DVD的事
<2-6,Sheldon>I promise I won't pester you about the DVD.

91
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,560
<2-6,Sheldon>也还你清静的拉屎时光
<2-6,Sheldon>You can defecate in peace.

92
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,750
<2-6,Sheldon>这对我们也是双赢  但是...
<2-6,Sheldon>That's a win for both of us. But...

93
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,520
<2-6,Sheldon>在你处理完这事之前
<2-6,Sheldon>until this matter is resolved,

94
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,200
<2-6,Sheldon>我要你
<2-6,Sheldon>I would like you

95
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,280
<2-6,Sheldon>穿着这件毛衣
<2-6,Sheldon>to wear this sweater.

96
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,110
<2-6,Sheldon>而且底下不许穿任何衣服
<2-6,Sheldon>With nothing underneath it.

97
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,710
<2-7,Leonard>这蠢爆了  为啥要我穿
<2-7,Leonard>That's stupid. Why?

98
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,250
<2-8,Sheldon>你说这穿起来又痒又不舒服
<2-8,Sheldon>You say it's itchy and uncomfortable.

99
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,380
<2-8,Sheldon>我对这事的感受也正是如此
<2-8,Sheldon>I say situations like this make me feel the same way.

100
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,960
<2-9,Leonard>信我的  试试用衣架子啊
<2-9,Leonard>I'm telling you, try the hanger.

101
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,700
<2-10,Sheldon>穿上
<2-10,Sheldon>Put it on.

102
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,960
<2-10,Sheldon>体验体验我的感受
<2-10,Sheldon>Let's share the experience.

103
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,050
<2-11,Leonard>满足你
<2-11,Leonard>You got it.

104
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,400
<2-11,Leonard>如果穿上这毛衣就能让你闭嘴
<2-11,Leonard>If this sweater shuts you up,

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,410
<2-11,Leonard>那我以后光卖这个
<2-11,Leonard>I'm gonna make a fortune

106
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,580
<2-11,Leonard>给我们认识的人  就能发大财
<2-11,Leonard>selling them to everyone we know.

107
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,150
<2-11,Leonard>现在
<2-11,Leonard>Now...

108
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,280
<2-11,Leonard>我只需要走到录像带店
<2-11,Leonard>all I need to do is head down to the video store

109
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,360
<2-11,Leonard>还了这DVD就行了
<2-11,Leonard>and return the DVD.

110
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,110
<2-12,Sheldon>我忘了跟你说了吗
<2-12,Sheldon>Oh, did I forget to tell you?

111
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,490
<2-12,Sheldon>那家店几年前就倒闭了
<2-12,Sheldon>That store went out of business years ago.

112
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,160
<2-13,Leonard>是吗
<2-13,Leonard>Really?

113

<3-5,Penny>I scraped gum off the bottom of that table.

120

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,080
<3-8,Penny>不知道为什么  我总是以为那个女是个印度人
<3-8,Penny>I don't know why but I always pictured her as Indian.

125
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,710
<3-9,Bernadette>因为你有种族歧视
<3-9,Bernadette>I think that reason's called racism.

126
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,270
<3-10,Penny>我要过去跟她说话
<3-10,Penny>I'm gonna go talk to her.

127
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,240
<3-11,Bernadette>为什么  你要说什么
<3-11,Bernadette>Why? What are you gonna say?

128
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,190
<3-12,Penny>我什么都不会说
<3-12,Penny>I'm not gonna say anything.

129
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,320
<3-12,Penny>我只是想探下她的口风
<3-12,Penny>I just want to check her out.

130
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,350
<3-12,Penny>因为她伤害了我的朋友
<3-12,Penny>Because she hurt my friend.

131
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,980
<3-12,Penny>我的印度朋友
<3-12,Penny>My Indian friend.

132
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,710
<3-12,Penny>-现在是谁种族歧视  -你啊
<3-12,Penny>- Who's racist now? - You.

133
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,060
<3-13,Bernadette>因为你刚称拉杰是你的"印度朋友"
<3-13,Bernadette>Because you just called him your "Indian friend."

134
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,890
<3-14,Penny>怎样  你个矮冬瓜
<3-14,Penny>Yeah, well, you're short.

135
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,670
<3-15,Amy>看来我们喝不上东西了
<3-15,Amy>We're never getting our drinks.

136
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,850
<3-16,Bernadette>是啊  但我们早就料到了
<3-16,Bernadette>No, but we knew that.

137
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,860
<3-17,Penny>你想先来点喝的吗
<3-17,Penny>Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?

138
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,360
<3-18,Lucy>-来杯水吧  -好的
<3-18,Lucy>- Oh, water would be great. - Okay.

139
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,490
<3-19,Penny>你是露西吧
<3-19,Penny>Um, you're Lucy, right?

140
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,020
<3-19,Penny>我是拉杰什·库萨帕里的朋友
<3-19,Penny>I'm a friend of Raj Koothrappali's.

141
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,040
<3-19,Penny>其实先认出你的是艾米
<3-19,Penny>Actually Amy recognized you.

142
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,510
<3-20,Lucy>他现在怎么样
<3-20,Lucy>How's he doing?

143
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,100
<3-21,Penny>还不错
<3-21,Penny>Oh, you know, he's good.

144
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,310
<3-22,Lucy>很好
<3-22,Lucy>Great.

145
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,490
<3-23,Penny>这虽然不关我的事
<3-23,Penny>Yeah, this is none of my business.

146
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,130
<3-23,Penny>但你为什么要用一封电邮跟他分手
<3-23,Penny>But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?

147
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,720
<3-23,Penny>我也不知道
<3-23,Penny>Oh, I don't know.

148
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,060
<3-24,Lucy>可能当时我觉得这样轻松点吧
<3-24,Lucy>I guess I thought it would be easier.

149
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,030
<3-25,Penny>好吧  我懂了
<3-25,Penny>Yeah, I get that.

150
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,580
<3-25,Penny>我去给你拿水
<3-25,Penny>I'll go get you your water.

151
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,220
<3-25,Penny>你刚说"轻松点"
<3-25,Penny>When you say "easier,"

152
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,190
<3-25,Penny>是指对你而言  对吧
<3-25,Penny>you mean easier for you, right?

153
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,030
<3-25,Penny>因为这对他而言  一点也不轻松
<3-25,Penny>'Cause it certainly didn't make it easier for him.

154
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,210
<3-26,Lucy>我能换一个服务员吗
<3-26,Lucy>Any chance I can get a different waitress?

155
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,810
<3-27,Penny>很抱歉  我失礼了
<3-27,Penny>I-I'm sorry, this is rude of me.

156
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,640
<3-27,Penny>我现在就给你拿水
<3-27,Penny>I will go get that water.

157
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,090
<3-27,Penny>瞧瞧  瞧瞧
<3-27,Penny>See, see, see, see.

158
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,330
<3-27,Penny>刚才你就当着我的面  表达了你的感受
<3-27,Penny>Just now you expressed your feelings to my face.

159
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,470
<3-27,Penny>为什么对我就可以  对拉杰就不行呢
<3-27,Penny>How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?

160
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,490
<3-28,Lucy>因为我不知道你的邮箱
<3-28,Lucy>I don't know your e-mail.

161
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,930
<3-29,Penny>你知道最糟糕的是什么吗
<3-29,Penny>You know what the worst part is?

162
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,500
<3-29,Penny>你坐在这里  喜眉笑眼
<3-29,Penny>You're sitting here, perfectly happy

163
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,520
<3-29,Penny>而他却窝在家  以泪洗面
<3-29,Penny>and he's at home, a blubbering mess.

164
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,790
<3-30,Lucy>你刚不是说他过得还不错吗
<3-30,Lucy>Oh, I thought you said he was okay.

165
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,090
<3-31,Penny>我还说给你端水过来呢
<3-31,Penny>Well, I also said I was getting you water,

166
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,810
<3-31,Penny>但我现在不还站在这教训你吗
<3-31,Penny>but look at me still standing here.

167
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,790
<3-31,Penny>或许我是个烂服务员
<3-31,Penny>You know, I may be a bad waitress,

168
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,680
<3-31,Penny>但你是个烂人
<3-31,Penny>but you are a bad person.

169
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,450
<3-31,Penny>对了  你想听听今晚的特餐吗
<3-31,Penny>Now, you want to hear the specials?

170
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,390
<4-1,Howard>你永远都不能脱下来吗
<4-1,Howard>So, you can never take it off?

171
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,150
<4-2,Leonard>是的
<4-2,Leonard>No.

172
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,520
<4-3,Raj>连睡觉都不行吗
<4-3,Raj>Not even to sleep?

173
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,810
<4-4,Leonard>是的
<4-4,Leonard>No.

174
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,890
<4-5,Howard>所以你就是一白痴嘛
<4-5,Howard>So, you're just an idiot?

175
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,410
<4-6,Leonard>我是为了证明我的观点
<4-6,Leonard>It's called proving a point.

176
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,190
<4-7,Howard>你的观点就是你的白痴吗
<4-7,Howard>Is the point you're an idiot?

177
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,940
<4-8,Sheldon>先生们  别这样嘛
<4-8,Sheldon>Gentlemen, please.

178
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,020
<4-8,Sheldon>莱纳德只是假设性穿着我的鞋  换位思考而已
<4-8,Sheldon>Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes.

179
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,010
<4-8,Sheldon>当然他不能真穿我的鞋子
<4-8,Sheldon>He can't walk in my actual shoes.

180
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,100
<4-8,Sheldon>因为他有双婴儿脚
<4-8,Sheldon>He has the feet of a toddler.

181
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,570
<4-9,Raj>如果那家店已经关门了
<4-9,Raj>So, how are you gonna return the DVD

182
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,970
<4-9,Raj>你要怎么把DVD还给人家
<4-9,Raj>if the store went out of business?

183
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,280
<4-10,Leonard>周一上午我会去市中心一趟
<4-10,Leonard>Monday morning I'll go downtown

184
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,240
<4-10,Leonard>查一下店主的资料
<4-10,Leonard>look up the owner's information.

185
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,070
<4-10,Leonard>然后把DVD寄回去给他
<4-10,Leonard>And send him the DVD.

186
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,180
<4-10,Leonard>再把滞纳金交了
<4-10,Leonard>Pay the late fee.

187
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,790
<4-10,Leonard>同时向谢尔顿证明
<4-10,Leonard>And prove to Sheldon

188
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,750
<4-10,Leonard>在遇到问题和解决问题的过程中
<4-10,Leonard>that you can have a problem and solve it...

189
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
<4-10,Leonard>人不一定都要表现得像个十足的疯子
<4-10,Leonard>...without acting like a complete lunatic.

190
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,750
<4-11,Howard>而那个假扮成熊的人会希望大家知道
<4-11,Howard>And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know

191
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,540
<4-11,Howard>护林熊身穿美国护林警服装的漫画熊
<4-11,Howard>其身上印有"Only you can prevent forest fires"字样

192
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,540
<4-11,Howard>"只有你能防止森林火灾"
<4-11,Howard>that "Only you can prevent forest fires."

193
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,600
<4-12,Raj>我没明白笑点
<4-12,Raj>I don't get it.

194
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,880
<4-13,Howard>-你们印度没有护林熊吗  -没有
<4-13,Howard>- You didn't have Smokey the Bear in India? - No.

196
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,680
<4-14,Raj>是不是像我们的獴狐猴
<4-14,Raj>Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose?

197
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,220
<4-14,Raj>它教导我们不要跟眼镜蛇一起玩
<4-14,Raj>He taught us not to play with cobras.

198
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,840
<4-15,Howard>没人教你们就会去跟眼镜蛇玩吗
<4-15,Howard>You had to be taught not to play with cobras?

199
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,070
<4-16,Raj>没人教你们就会去烧森林吗
<4-16,Raj>You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?

200
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,160
<5-1,Penny>你们要是肚子饿
<5-1,Penny>Hey, if you guys were hungry,

201
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,900
<5-1,Penny>为什么在餐厅时不点东西吃呢
<5-1,Penny>why didn't you order something at the restaurant?

202
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,680
<5-2,Bernadette>我们点了啊  你没上菜而已
<5-2,Bernadette>We did, you never brought it.

203
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,800
<5-3,Penny>对哦
<5-3,Penny>Oh, that's right.

204
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,680
<5-3,Penny>玉米片与火鸡三明治
<5-3,Penny>Nachos and a turkey club.

205
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,110
<5-4,Amy>完全不对
<5-4,Amy>Not even close.

206
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,250
<5-5,Penny>那是因为我当时忙着在
<5-5,Penny>Well, I was too busy standing up

207
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,250
<5-5,Penny>为我们的朋友挺身而出  没空上...
<5-5,Penny>for my friend to worry about your...

208
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,300
<5-5,Penny>我想说是三文鱼吧
<5-5,Penny>I want to say salmon.

209
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,850
<5-6,Amy>你想说的应该是对不起
<5-6,Amy>You want to say sorry.

210
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,530
<5-7,Bernadette>所以你打算怎么跟拉杰解释你的行为
<5-7,Bernadette>So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?

211
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,150
<5-8,Penny>干嘛要想怎么解释  没什么大不了的
<5-8,Penny>What do you mean "how"? What's the big deal?

212
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,360
<5-9,Amy>你告诉露西他以泪洗面
<5-9,Amy>You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.

213
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,430
<5-10,Bernadette>把人家都说到哭着跑了
<5-10,Bernadette>Then you made her cry and leave.

214
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,120
<5-11,Penny>够了  你们想得也太严重了
<5-11,Penny>Okay, you guys are overreacting.

215
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,720
<5-11,Penny>拉杰会感谢我为他挺身而出的
<5-11,Penny>Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.

216
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,080
<5-11,Penny>你脑子进水了吗  佩妮
<5-11,Penny>What is wrong with you, Penny?!

217
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,500
<6-1,Raj>你毁了我与她重修旧好的可能性
<6-1,Raj>You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy!

218
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,710
<6-1,Raj>现在她知道我很悲催凄凉了
<6-1,Raj>Now she knows I'm a desperate mess

219
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,160
<6-1,Raj>她本来只能九成确定呢
<6-1,Raj>instead of just being pretty sure!

220
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,890
<6-1,Raj>是露西
<6-1,Raj>It's Lucy.

221
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,660
<6-1,Raj>她想邀我一起喝咖啡
<6-1,Raj>She wants to meet for coffee.

222
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,040
<6-1,Raj>我爱你  佩妮
<6-1,Raj>I love you, Penny!

223
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,260
<7-1,Howard>你在忙什么呢
<7-1,Howard>Hey, what're you working on?

224
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,030
<7-2,Sheldon>我在思考能不能借助
<7-2,Sheldon>I'm thinking about how one could use

225
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,580
<7-2,Sheldon>快速旋转镜把虚光子
<7-2,Sheldon>the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror

226
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,860
<7-2,Sheldon>转化为光子的方法
<7-2,Sheldon>turns virtual photons into real ones

227
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,820
<7-2,Sheldon>来解决吸收暗能量的问题
<7-2,Sheldon>as a method of observing dark energy.

228
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,850
<7-3,Howard>这主意挺有意思
<7-3,Howard>That's a pretty cool idea.

229
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,340
<7-4,Sheldon>是的  你来得正好
<7-4,Sheldon>Yeah. It's great you're here.

230
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,290
<7-4,Sheldon>我非常想听听工程师的意见
<7-4,Sheldon>I'd love to get an engineer's opinion.

231
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,370
<7-5,Howard>没问题
<7-5,Howard>Sure.

232
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,630
<7-6,Sheldon>我这椅子老吱吱响
<7-6,Sheldon>This chair is squeaky.

233
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,900
<7-6,Sheldon>你说我是送修还是买把新的
<7-6,Sheldon>Now, do I fix it or get a new one?

234
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,580
<7-7,Leonard>谢尔顿  我花了一早上的时间
<7-7,Leonard>Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning,

235
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,150
<7-7,Leonard>终于找到了那家录像店的店主
<7-7,Leonard>but I found the owner of the video store.

236
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,790
<7-7,Leonard>我很高兴地宣布  他是在睡梦中平静地死去
<7-7,Leonard>And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep,

237
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,670
<7-7,Leonard>也就是喝醉后淹死在泳池底了
<7-7,Leonard>drunk at the bottom of a pool.

238
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,390
<7-7,Leonard>总之  这DVD没有地方还
<7-7,Leonard>Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to,

239
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,080
<7-7,Leonard>问题圆满解决了
<7-7,Leonard>so this issue is resolved.

240
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,400
<7-7,Leonard>我要特别说明一点
<7-7,Leonard>And I'd just like to point out that

241
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,230
<7-7,Leonard>虽然这毛衣让人好不舒服
<7-7,Leonard>even though the sweater was uncomfortable,

242
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,210
<7-7,Leonard>我也没有以此为借口
<7-7,Leonard>I didn't use it as an excuse

243
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,800
<7-7,Leonard>到处顶撞周围的人
<7-7,Leonard>to antagonize everyone around me.

244
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,950
<7-8,Howard>你可以把它还给录像店老板的亲戚嘛
<7-8,Howard>You know, you could reimburse the video store owner's next of kin.

245
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,980
<7-9,Leonard>都说问题已经解决了
<7-9,Leonard>Or it's resolved!

246
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,870
<7-10,Sheldon>还给亲戚这主意听上去不错
<7-10,Sheldon>Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.

247
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,730
<7-11,Howard>这是你掉的吧
<7-11,Howard>I believe this is yours.

248
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,660
<7-11,Howard>能问你们个问题吗
<7-11,Howard>Can I ask you guys a question?

249
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,570
<8-1,Raj>我明晚就要去见露西了
<8-1,Raj>So, I'm seeing Lucy tomorrow night,

250
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,630
<8-1,Raj>我从来没和甩掉我的人出去玩过
<8-1,Raj>and I've never hung out with someone who broke up with me.

251
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,910
<8-1,Raj>我该怎么做呢
<8-1,Raj>How do you do it?

252
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,240
<8-2,Howard>你不能让她发现你很受伤
<8-2,Howard>You can't let her know you're hurting.

253
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,850
<8-2,Howard>关键是要充满自信
<8-2,Howard>You know, the key is confidence.

254
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,940
<8-3,Raj>为什么每件事的关键都是充满自信
<8-3,Raj>Why is the key always confidence?

255
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,480
<8-3,Raj>怎么就不能是腰间赘肉啦  焦虑不安啦
<8-3,Raj>How come it's never love handles and flop sweat?

256
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,970
<8-4,Bernadette>如果这姑娘伤你这么深
<8-4,Bernadette>If this girl hurt you so much,

257
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,640
<8-4,Bernadette>你真的还想和她见面吗
<8-4,Bernadette>are you sure you want to see her again?

258
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,710
<8-5,Howard>容我说明一下
<8-5,Howard>Well, if I may...

259
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,150
<8-5,Howard>他这人自尊心几乎为零
<8-5,Howard>he has so little self-respect

260
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,820
<8-5,Howard>又极度渴望哪怕是微乎其微的爱情
<8-5,Howard>and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection,

261
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,640
<8-5,Howard>所以她就算在拉杰的床上
<8-5,Howard>she could literally sleep with his own father

262
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,630
<8-5,Howard>睡了他爹  还把视频发到网上
<8-5,Howard>in his own bed and post the video to YouTube,

263
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,380
<8-5,Howard>拉杰还是会送花给她
<8-5,Howard>and he'd still buy her flowers

264
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,050
<8-5,Howard>并向她求婚
<8-5,Howard>and ask her to be his bride.

265
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,750
<8-5,Howard>他说得没错
<8-5,Howard>He's right.

266
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,150
<8-6,Raj>但我的理由是  如果能通过这个考验
<8-6,Raj>But in my defense, if we could survive that,

267
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,300
<8-6,Raj>世上还有什么能把我俩分开呢
<8-6,Raj>we could survive anything.

268
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,040
<8-7,Bernadette>既然你真的愿意这么做
<8-7,Bernadette>Well, if you're sure you want to do this,

269
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
<8-7,Bernadette>反正也只是喝个咖啡而已
<8-7,Bernadette>it's only coffee...

270
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,380
<8-7,Bernadette>你就放松心态  静观其变吧
<8-7,Bernadette>just relax and see what happens.

271
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,350
<8-8,Raj>-那我能夸她气色不错吗  -当然
<8-8,Raj>- Well, can I say she looks nice? - Sure.

272
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,100
<8-10,Raj>能说我好想她吗
<8-10,Raj>Can I tell her I miss her?

273
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,880
<8-11,Bernadette>如果她问起的话  也许吧
<8-11,Bernadette>Maybe, if she asks.

274
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,280
<8-12,Raj>能给她看看我手绘的一幅
<8-12,Raj>Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made

275
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,220
<8-12,Raj>我和她被儿孙们环绕的油画吗
<8-12,Raj>of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?

276
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,070
<8-13,Bernadette>这还是留着第二次见面时再说吧
<8-13,Bernadette>I'd save that for the second date.

277
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,630
<8-14,Raj>也好  也好
<8-14,Raj>Good, good.

278
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,170
<8-14,Raj>反正不管我怎么努力
<8-14,Raj>'Cause no matter how hard I try,

279
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,900
<8-14,Raj>都没法把那对双胞胎画得一模一样
<8-14,Raj>I cannot get the twins to look alike.

280
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,450
<9-1,Penny>你在干什么
<9-1,Penny>What are you doing?

281
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,290
<9-2,Leonard>我在寻找那个傻逼店主的
<9-2,Leonard>Oh, I'm just trying to find the stupid next of kin

282
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,640
<9-2,Leonard>傻逼亲戚  好把DVD还给他们
<9-2,Leonard>to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD

283
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,560
<9-2,Leonard>好欣赏谢尔顿看到这事没烦到我时
<9-2,Leonard>and see the look on Sheldon's stupid face

284
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,390
<9-2,Leonard>他脸上的傻逼表情
<9-2,Leonard>when he sees that I didn't let this get to me.

285
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,170
<9-3,Penny>谢尔顿又不在
<9-3,Penny>Sheldon's not here.

286
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,490
<9-3,Penny>干嘛不把毛衣脱下来
<9-3,Penny>Why don't you take the sweater off?

287
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,650
<9-4,Leonard>这牵涉到原则问题
<9-4,Leonard>Th-Th-There's a principle at stake!

288
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,110
<9-5,Penny>-什么原则  -我也不知道
<9-5,Penny>- Which is? - Oh, I don't know.

289
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,950
<9-6,Leonard>谁管它呀  看我这一身
<9-6,Leonard>Who cares? Look at me!

290
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,610
<9-7,Penny>我的天
<9-7,Penny>Oh, my God!

291
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,880
<9-7,Penny>这毛衣是用蜜蜂织的吗
<9-7,Penny>Is that sweater made of bees?

292
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,510
<9-7,Penny>快脱下来吧  我不会告诉他的
<9-7,Penny>Come on, take it off. I won't tell.

293
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,670
<9-8,Leonard>不行  如果我脱下来的话  谢尔顿就赢了
<9-8,Leonard>No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.

294
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,570
<9-9,Penny>亲爱的
<9-9,Penny>Sweetie...

295
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,930
<9-9,Penny>每天夜里你没有把他谋杀在睡梦之中时
<9-9,Penny>every night you don't kill him in his sleep,

296
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,620
<9-9,Penny>他就已经赢了
<9-9,Penny>he wins.

297
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,910
<9-10,Leonard>算了...我就快成功了
<9-10,Leonard>Nah, I-it's... it's almost done.

298
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,230
<9-10,Leonard>我只需要找到他的亲戚
<9-10,Leonard>I just, I have to find...the next of kin,

299
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,470
<9-10,Leonard>把DVD寄给他们
<9-10,Leonard>and send 'em the DVD

300
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,690
<9-10,Leonard>然后坐等和我肤色相同的人死掉
<9-10,Leonard>and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die

301
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,680
<9-10,Leonard>我就可以植皮了
<9-10,Leonard>so I can get a skin graft.

302
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,820
<9-11,Penny>笑一个
<9-11,Penny>Smile.

303
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,400
<9-12,Leonard>你这是干嘛  拍照干嘛
<9-12,Leonard>What-what is that? What is that for?

304
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,510
<9-13,Penny>你可以把它发给普林斯顿大学
<9-13,Penny>So you can send it to Princeton

305
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,380
<9-13,Penny>把你白交的学费要回来
<9-13,Penny>and get your money back.

306
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,170
<10-1,Amy>不得不说  谢尔顿
<10-1,Amy>I must say, Sheldon,

307
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,680
<10-1,Amy>这DVD的事  你处理得
<10-1,Amy>you're handling this DVD business

308
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,710
<10-1,Amy>相当成熟  令我刮目相看
<10-1,Amy>with an impressive amount of maturity.

309
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,810
<10-2,Sheldon>这有什么可感叹的
<10-2,Sheldon>I don't know why that surprises you.

310
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,230
<10-2,Sheldon>我本来就是个成熟的人
<10-2,Sheldon>I'm a grown man.

311
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,320
<10-2,Sheldon>我的运动夹克
<10-2,Sheldon>As should be evident by this sport coat

312
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,280
<10-2,Sheldon>和这朵逼真的胸花也证实了这一点
<10-2,Sheldon>and very real flower in my lapel.

313
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,210
<10-3,Amy>你是不是实践了某种新的应对机制呀
<10-3,Amy>Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you're employing?

314
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,260
<10-4,Sheldon>你应该问点更有趣的问题
<10-4,Sheldon>The more interesting question you should be asking is,

315
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,130
<10-4,Sheldon>比如"这朵花闻起来是什么香味呢"
<10-4,Sheldon>"What does this flower smell like?"

316
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,770
<10-5,Amy>我看是"可悲味"吧
<10-5,Amy>I'm gonna go with sad.

317
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,220
<10-5,Amy>所以那DVD背后有什么内幕吗
<10-5,Amy>So what's the story with you and this DVD?

318
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,700
<10-6,Sheldon>哪有什么内幕
<10-6,Sheldon>There's nothing to tell.

319
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,610
<10-6,Sheldon>也许是因为我买了一本书
<10-6,Sheldon>Maybe I purchased a book entitled,

320
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,430
<10-6,Sheldon>叫做《别为小事担忧》
<10-6,Sheldon>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff

321
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,040
<10-6,Sheldon>我听从了里面的睿智建议
<10-6,Sheldon>and I followed its wise suggestions,

322
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,340
<10-6,Sheldon>其中一条是
<10-6,Sheldon>one of which was:

323
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,900
<10-6,Sheldon>驻足片刻闻花香[别说了  快闻花吧]
<10-6,Sheldon>stop and smell the flowers.

324
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,820
<10-7,Amy>-你不是吧  -求你啦
<10-7,Amy>- Seriously? - Please.

325
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,800
<11-1,Lucy>-你好  -来啦
<11-1,Lucy>- Hi. - Hello.

326
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,110
<11-2,Raj>见到你我真高兴
<11-2,Raj>Oh, it's so good to see you.

327
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,450
<11-3,Lucy>我也是
<11-3,Lucy>You, too.

328
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,820
<11-4,Raj>请坐
<11-4,Raj>Please, sit.

329
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,700
<11-4,Raj>我帮你点了卡布奇诺
<11-4,Raj>I, uh, I got you a cappuccino.

330
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,370
<11-4,Raj>我记得这是你最喜欢的
<11-4,Raj>I remembered it was your favorite.

331
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,630
<11-4,Raj>我还点了屑饼蛋糕
<11-4,Raj>I also got crumb cake,

332
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,350
<11-4,Raj>但我想起来这是我最喜欢的  我就吃了
<11-4,Raj>but I remembered it was my favorite and I ate it.

333
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,330
<11-4,Raj>总之  你还好吗
<11-4,Raj>Anyway, uh, how are you?

334
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,180
<11-4,Raj>挺好的
<11-4,Raj>I'm pretty good.

335
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,450
<11-5,Lucy>听我说  我想跟你道歉
<11-5,Lucy>Listen, I just wanted to apologize

336
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,290
<11-5,Lucy>我不该用一封电邮和你分手
<11-5,Lucy>for breaking up with you in an e-mail.

337
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,360
<11-6,Raj>我也吃光了屑饼蛋糕
<11-6,Raj>Well, and I ate all the crumb cake.

338
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,900
<11-6,Raj>人都会犯错的嘛
<11-6,Raj>we both made mistakes.

339
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,460
<11-7,Lucy>好的
<11-7,Lucy>Okay.

340
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,450
<11-8,Raj>你约我出来我真是太高兴了
<11-8,Raj>I'm so happy you asked me here,

341
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,030
<11-8,Raj>希望我们改天还能再聚
<11-8,Raj>and I hope we can hang out again sometime.

342
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,680
<11-8,Raj>不论是朋友关系
<11-8,Raj>You know, as friends,

343
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
<11-8,Raj>还是炮友关系  都行
<11-8,Raj>lovemaking partners, whatever.

344
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,750
<11-9,Lucy>其实我有对象了
<11-9,Lucy>I'm kind of seeing someone.

345
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,920
<11-10,Raj>我想我知道怎么回答
<11-10,Raj>I think I know the answer to this,

346
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,750
<11-10,Raj>但还是要搞清楚  你说的不是我  对吗
<11-10,Raj>but just to be clear, it's not me, right?

347
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,370
<12-1,Raj>这全是你的错
<12-1,Raj>This is all your fault!

348
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,520
<12-1,Raj>我应该听獴狐猴的话
<12-1,Raj>I should've listened to Mun-Mun

349
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,110
<12-1,Raj>因为我一直在和
<12-1,Raj>because I've been playing with a cobra

350
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,140
<12-1,Raj>叫做佩妮的眼镜蛇玩
<12-1,Raj>and her name is Penny!

351
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,920
<12-1,Raj>你为什么这么残忍
<12-1,Raj>Why are you so cruel?

352
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,340
<12-1,Raj>看着我痛苦你很享受吗
<12-1,Raj>Do you enjoy my pain?

353
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,440
<12-2,Penny>芝士蛋糕工厂有个女生  我可以帮你介绍
<12-2,Penny>There's a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.

354
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,830
<12-3,Raj>我爱你  佩妮
<12-3,Raj>I love you, Penny!

355
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,500
<12-3,Raj>为什么我能将检测宇宙暗物质的
<12-3,Raj>How is it I can conceptualize a methodology

356
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,710
<13-1,Sheldon>方法概念化
<13-1,Sheldon>of examining dark matter in the universe

357
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,990
<13-1,Sheldon>却想不出办法修好整蛊喷水花呢
<13-1,Sheldon>but can't figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?

358
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,570
<13-2,Amy>我想真正的问题在于
<13-2,Amy>I think the real question is,

359
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,250
<13-2,Amy>你为什么要将时间浪费在廉价幼稚的恶作剧上
<13-2,Amy>why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?

360
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,360
<13-3,Sheldon>可能有深层的原因
<13-3,Sheldon>There's probably a deep reason.

361
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,430
<13-3,Sheldon>我很乐意和你一边吃点罐子里的花生糖
<13-3,Sheldon>Which I'd be happy to discuss with you

362
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,160
<13-3,Sheldon>一边讨论这个问题
<13-3,Sheldon>over some peanut brittle in a can.

363
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,890
<13-4,Leonard>谢尔顿  我已经没办法了
<13-4,Leonard>Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options!

364
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,540
<13-4,Leonard>录像带店的老板  勒西斯·曼鲁奇恩
<13-4,Leonard>Video store owner, Nursis Manookian,

365
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,460
<13-4,Leonard>根本就没有直系亲属
<13-4,Leonard>has no next of kin!

366
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,100
<13-5,Sheldon>你看起来怒气冲冲的
<13-5,Sheldon>Well, you seem hot under the collar...

367
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,210
<13-5,Sheldon>是毛衣闹的吗
<13-5,Sheldon>or is that the sweater?

368
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,510
<13-5,Sheldon>不不
<13-5,Sheldon>Oh, oh, no, no.

369
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,600
<13-6,Leonard>是因为我花了一下午时间
<13-6,Leonard>I-It's because I spent all afternoon

370
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,260
<13-6,Leonard>去举行他葬礼的亚美尼亚教堂调查
<13-6,Leonard>at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held.

371
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,030
<13-6,Leonard>据索拉奇恩神父所说
<13-6,Leonard>According to Father Solakian,

372
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,540
<13-6,Leonard>没人参加葬礼
<13-6,Leonard>no one attended.

373
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,530
<13-6,Leonard>幸运的是  我跑这趟并不是完全浪费时间
<13-6,Leonard>Luckily, my trip wasn't a complete waste.

374
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,090
<13-6,Leonard>我点了根蜡烛  祈祷你快死
<13-6,Leonard>I lit a candle and prayed for your death.

375
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,720
<13-6,Leonard>但我不是亚美尼亚人  所以可能不管用
<13-6,Leonard>But I'm not Armenian, so it probably won't work!

376
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,690
<13-6,Leonard>这事结束了  对吧
<13-6,Leonard>This is over, right?

377
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,700
<13-7,Sheldon>不一定
<13-7,Sheldon>Oh, not necessarily.

378
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,280
<13-7,Sheldon>我建议你去亚美尼亚或是黎巴嫩
<13-7,Sheldon>I suggest you look for long-lost relatives

379
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,780
<13-7,Sheldon>找找有没有失联已久的亲戚
<13-7,Sheldon>either in Armenia or Lebanon.

380
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,980
<13-8,Leonard>听好了  谢尔顿
<13-8,Leonard>Listen to me, Sheldon.

381
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,010
<13-8,Leonard>我不会去黎巴嫩
<13-8,Leonard>I am not going to Lebanon

382
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,870
<13-8,Leonard>还《超级马里奥兄弟》的影碟
<13-8,Leonard>to return Super Mario Bros. the movie!

383
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,270
<13-9,Sheldon>也许很好玩呢
<13-9,Sheldon>You know, it might be fun.

384
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,590
<13-9,Sheldon>反正你爱吃鹰嘴豆泥[黎巴嫩特色食品]
<13-9,Sheldon>You love hummus.

385
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,820
<13-10,Leonard>为什么你好像不在意这事呢
<13-10,Leonard>Why isn't this bothering you?

386
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,050
<13-10,Leonard>你的脑袋里面不痒吗
<13-10,Leonard>I-Isn't your brain getting itchy?

387
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,430
<13-10,Leonard>这是你的卡借的
<13-10,Leonard>This is on your card.

388
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,590
<13-10,Leonard>有可能会毁了你的信用记录
<13-10,Leonard>This could be ruining your credit score!

389
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,170
<13-10,Leonard>为什么这事没让你发疯呢
<13-10,Leonard>Why isn't this making you crazy?

390
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,820
<13-10,Leonard>莱纳德
<13-10,Leonard>Leonard...

391
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,330
<13-11,Sheldon>我有话跟你说
<13-11,Sheldon>I have something to tell you,

392
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,430
<13-11,Sheldon>但我要你保证  不许跳脚
<13-11,Sheldon>but I want you to promise not to flip out.

393
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,160
<13-12,Leonard>什么事
<13-12,Leonard>What?

394
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,290
<13-13,Sheldon>七年前
<13-13,Sheldon>Seven years ago,

395
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,460
<13-13,Sheldon>我发现DVD过期未还
<13-13,Sheldon>I found out the DVD was late

396
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,430
<13-13,Sheldon>已经付了钱了
<13-13,Sheldon>and I paid for it.

397
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,270
<13-12,Leonard>什么
<13-12,Leonard>What?

398
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,290
<13-15,Sheldon>我当时准备跟你说的
<13-15,Sheldon>I was going to mention it at the time,

399
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,900
<13-15,Sheldon>但我想  有一天
<13-15,Sheldon>but then I thought, some day,

400
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,560
<13-15,Sheldon>这件事能给你好好上一课
<13-15,Sheldon>this might be a teachable moment.

401
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,450
<13-16,Leonard>我...你...
<13-16,Leonard>I... You...

402
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,510
<13-16,Leonard>怎么这样
<13-16,Leonard>How can...

403
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,670
<13-16,Leonard>你是不是人啊
<13-16,Leonard>What?!

404
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,680
<13-17,Amy>谢尔顿
<13-17,Amy>Sheldon...

405
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,970
<13-17,Amy>你这样做太恶毒了
<13-17,Amy>that was diabolical.

406
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,780
<13-17,Amy>我知道
<13-17,Amy>I know.

407
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,550
<13-18,Sheldon>其实我也不容易
<13-18,Sheldon>And it wasn't easy.

408
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,780
<13-18,Sheldon>你明白等待多年却不知道
<13-18,Sheldon>Do you have any idea what it's like to wait for years

409
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,820
<13-18,Sheldon>能否得到最终的"满足"  有多痛苦吗
<13-18,Sheldon>and never know if you're going to finally get satisfaction?

410
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,620
<14-1,Raj>你比佩妮形容的还要漂亮
<14-1,Raj>You're even prettier than Penny said.

411
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,030
<14-1,Raj>我不敢相信你这样的女生
<14-1,Raj>I can't believe a girl like you

412
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,400
<14-1,Raj>居然没有男友
<14-1,Raj>doesn't have a boyfriend.

413
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,330
<14-2,Girl>我没有
<14-2,Girl>Well, I don't.

414
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,540
<14-3,Raj>我不相信你  你在骗我
<14-3,Raj>I don't believe you, you're lying to me!

415
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,750
<14-4,Girl>什么
<14-4,Girl>What?

416
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,680
<14-4,Girl>没关系
<14-4,Girl>Oh, it's okay.

417
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,660
<14-5,Raj>我没道德底线  我寂寞到绝望的程度
<14-5,Raj>I have no morals and I'm desperately lonely.

418
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,480
<14-5,Raj>我不介意做小三
<14-5,Raj>I'll be the other man

419
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,160
<14-5,Raj>你要一枝红杏出墙来  我会依着墙角站
<14-5,Raj>if you want a little something-something on the side.

420
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,580
<15-1,Girl (to Penny)>你脑子进水了吗
<15-1,Girl (to Penny)>What is wrong with you?!

421
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,280
<15-1,Girl (to Penny)>你脑子进水了吗
<15-1,Girl (to Penny)>What is wrong with you?!

422
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,350
<15-1,Girl (to Penny)>你脑子进水了吗
<15-1,Girl (to Penny)>What is wrong with you?!
