2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,280
<1-1,Amy>你为我取的爱称
<1-1,Amy>your pet name for me.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,020
<1-1,Amy>时间不多了  你得下决定
<1-1,Amy>Time's running out on this. You need to make a decision.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,590
<1-2,Sheldon>我发给你公证过的爱称提议表了
<1-2,Sheldon>I submitted you a notarized list.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,730
<1-3,Amy>抱歉  你提的"咕噜"跟"疯婆子"不行好吗
<1-3,Amy>I'm sorry, but "Gollum" and "Flakey" are not acceptable.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,070
<1-4,Sheldon>你也不喜欢"玉米公主"
<1-4,Sheldon>Well, you don't like "Princess Corncob"

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,310
<1-4,Sheldon>也不喜欢"费斯特"  你真是太难伺候了
<1-4,Sheldon>you don't like "Fester"-- you're just impossible to please.

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,220
<1-5,Amy>这项之后再说好了
<1-5,Amy>We'll come back to that one.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,590
<1-5,Amy>现在到了我们的
<1-5,Amy>This brings us to the final item

12

14
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,880
<1-6,Sheldon>图穷匕就现了
<1-6,Sheldon>Ah, the worst for last.

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,180
<1-6,Sheldon>完全的疯婆作风
<1-6,Sheldon>Classic Flakey.

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,580
<1-7,Amy>先别不开心  我相信我已经想到了
<1-7,Amy>Before you get upset, I believe I've come up with

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,980
<1-7,Amy>一个既能庆祝节日  又能让你我
<1-7,Amy>a way for us to celebrate the occasion

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,480
<1-7,Amy>都开心的好计划
<1-7,Amy>that we both can enjoy.

19
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,890
<1-8,Sheldon>大多数人都是在会议开始前用笑话开场
<1-8,Sheldon>People usually start a meeting with a joke,

20
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,440
<1-8,Sheldon>但你继续  用笑话结尾也行
<1-8,Sheldon>but you go ahead-- end with one.

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,350
<1-9,Amy>我提议我们去纳帕谷酒庄的
<1-9,Amy>I propose we spend a weekend

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,650
<1-9,Amy>住宿加早餐酒店共度一个周末
<1-9,Amy>at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,880
<1-10,Sheldon>我讨厌你句子里的每个字
<1-10,Sheldon>I hate every word in that sentence.

24
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,090
<1-10,Sheldon>包含"共度"  "去"  "我们"以及"一个"
<1-10,Sheldon>Including "in" "at," "we" and "a".

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,310
<1-11,Amy>为什么  谢尔顿  给个理由
<1-11,Amy>Come on, Sheldon. Why not?

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,950
<1-12,Sheldon>首先  住那种酒店就一定得跟
<1-12,Sheldon>For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you

27
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,040
<1-12,Sheldon>陌生人坐一起共进早餐
<1-12,Sheldon>to eat with strangers at your table.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,080
<1-13,Amy>我早想到了
<1-13,Amy>One step ahead of you--

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,120
<1-13,Amy>伯纳黛特跟沃罗威茨会一起来
<1-13,Amy>Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.

30
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,040
<1-14,Sheldon>很好
<1-14,Sheldon>Oh, very well.

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,630
<1-14,Sheldon>那房间怎么安排
<1-14,Sheldon>What are the sleeping arrangements?

32
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,320
<1-14,Sheldon>我们才刚约会三年呢
<1-14,Sheldon>We've only been dating for three years.

33
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,590
<1-14,Sheldon>如果我们睡同一间  会被人说闲话的
<1-14,Sheldon>If we were to share a room, people might talk.

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,640
<1-15,Amy>我帮你订了自己一间
<1-15,Amy>I got you your own room.

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,060
<1-16,Sheldon>-万一我房里的是爪脚浴缸怎么办  -不是的
<1-16,Sheldon>- What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub? - It doesn't.

36
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,060
<1-17,Amy>我知道你会觉得那像是在怪兽肚里洗澡
<1-17,Amy>I know it makes you feel like you're bathing inside a monster.

37
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,180
<1-18,Sheldon>我很谢谢你的心意
<1-18,Sheldon>Look, I appreciate the effort,

38
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,150
<1-18,Sheldon>但我还是不知道
<1-18,Sheldon>but I'm still unclear how this trip

39
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,020
<1-18,Sheldon>这旅行有什么值得让我开心的地方
<1-18,Sheldon>is supposed to be enjoyable for me.

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,210
<1-19,Amy>我们的情人节晚餐的地点就在
<1-19,Amy>We're going to have Valentine's Day dinner

41
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,830
<1-19,Amy>一辆运作正常的古董火车上
<1-19,Amy>on a fully functioning vintage train.

42
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,850
<1-20,Sheldon>怎么古董  解释详细点
<1-20,Sheldon>Vintage? Be specific.

43
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,320
<1-21,Amy>美国铝业FA-4型柴油火车头
<1-21,Amy>An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,450
<1-21,Amy>拉着完美修复的

00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,760
<1-21,Amy>1915年款的普尔曼头等火车厢
<1-21,Amy>1915 Pullman first-class coaches.

46
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,440
<1-22,Sheldon>我有一股想抱你的冲动
<1-22,Sheldon>I'm feeling the urge to hug you.

47
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,520
<1-22,Sheldon>一  二...
<1-22,Sheldon>And one... and two...

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,620

<2-1,Bernadette>你们确定不跟我们一起去纳帕谷酒庄吗
<2-1,Bernadette>Are you sure you guys don't want to come with us to Napa?

56
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,200
<2-1,Bernadette>现在还来得及订房哦
<2-1,Bernadette>You could probably still get a room.

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,780
<2-2,Penny>不用了  我们就在家静度周末吧
<2-2,Penny>No, I think we're just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.

58
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,280
<2-3,Leonard>而且我觉得带佩妮
<2-3,Leonard>Plus, I'm not sure it's a great idea

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,990
<2-3,Leonard>去生产酒的地方  不是个好主意
<2-3,Leonard>to take Penny to where wine comes from.

60
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,840
<2-3,Leonard>干嘛  开玩笑而已
<2-3,Leonard>What? It's a joke.

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,150
<2-3,Leonard>别这样  我们整天吐槽对方
<2-3,Leonard>Oh, come on. We bust on each other.

62
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,520
<2-3,Leonard>我戴傻逼眼镜  你可能有酗酒问题
<2-3,Leonard>I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem--

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,260
<2-3,Leonard>就是图个乐嘛
<2-3,Leonard>it's all for laughs.

64
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,540
<2-4,Penny>幸好我喝了有点晕乎  不然你死定了
<2-4,Penny>That would really piss me off if I didn't have a buzz going on.

65
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,170
<2-5,Sheldon>霍华德  你在火车上时会佩戴
<2-5,Sheldon>Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing

66
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,380
<2-5,Sheldon>哪块怀表呢
<2-5,Sheldon>for dinner on the train?

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,260
<2-6,Howard>麻烦再说一次
<2-6,Howard>I'm sorry, what?

68
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,620
<2-7,Sheldon>我是怕如果我们戴了同一块表
<2-7,Sheldon>Oh, I'm afraid if we wear the same pocket watch,

69
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,110
<2-7,Sheldon>会很尴尬
<2-7,Sheldon>it will be embarrassing.

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,420
<2-8,Howard>-我没有任何怀表  -天啊
<2-8,Howard>- I don't own a pocket watch. - Oh, my.

<2-9,Sheldon>抱歉  我不应该提起你的痛处
<2-9,Sheldon>Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,700
<2-10,Raj>既然你们两个情人节会在家
<2-10,Raj>Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine's,

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,070
<2-10,Raj>能帮忙我看一下小桂子吗

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,990
<2-11,Penny>你丫情人节有约啊
<2-11,Penny>You have Valentine's plans?!

75
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,340
<2-11,Penny>语气有点夸张了  其实我没那么惊讶
<2-11,Penny>Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant.

76
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,560
<2-11,Penny>我再重说一遍  你丫有...
<2-11,Penny>L-Let me try that again. You have Val...

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,550
<2-11,Penny>臣妾做不到啊
<2-11,Penny>See? I can't do it.

78
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,130
<2-12,Raj>我没有约  所以才订了那晚
<2-12,Raj>I don't have plans, which is why I booked time

79
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,910
<2-12,Raj>去看天文望远镜
<2-12,Raj>on the big telescope that night.

<2-13,Amy>整个夜晚都在看着满天星斗
<2-13,Amy>Well, an evening looking at the stars--

82
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,100
<2-14,Raj>可我是独自一人看
<2-14,Raj>Except I'll be alone.

83
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,430
<2-15,Amy>救这场跟给猪画口红一样难  你配合点好吗
<2-15,Amy>I'm trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.

<2-18,Raj>Oh, and I'd like for at least one of us to see some action,

87
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,890
<2-18,Raj>所以如果你们两个要做爱
<2-18,Raj>so if you guys happen to have sex,

<3-4,Sheldon>I'm prepared to say I love it,

95
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,840
<3-4,Sheldon>但我要先检查  车上有没有流浪汉
<3-4,Sheldon>as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.

111
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,470

<4-7,Leonard>It gets better. Instead of me,

112
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,510
<4-7,Leonard>你可以带其他爱看球的朋友去

<4-10,Penny>我们是不是该挪去房里再"庆祝"呢
<4-10,Penny>Should we take this little party to the bedroom?

<4-11,Leonard>不用了  整个家只剩我们
<4-11,Leonard>Don't have to-- we have the whole place to ourselves.

<4-13,Leonard>我们可以在谢尔顿的宝座上"做"
<4-13,Leonard>we can do it right here on Sheldon's spot.

<4-14,Penny>这是我这辈子听到过最让人失"性"致的话
<4-14,Penny>That is the least sexy thing anyone's ever said to me.

<5-2,Sheldon>这火车车厢是用着原来的杆销联结器呢
<5-2,Sheldon>Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler

125
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,650
<5-2,Sheldon>还是米勒式的
<5-2,Sheldon>or the Miller Hook and Platform?

126
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,940
<5-3,Waiter>抱歉  我是指对食物方面的问题

<5-4,Sheldon>with the original link-and-pin coupler

130
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,950
<5-4,Sheldon>还是在使用米勒式连接器的车厢上提供
<5-4,Sheldon>or the Miller Hook and Platform?

<5-5,Amy>我们还是待会儿再点菜吧

00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,100
<5-6,Man in seat behind>他们用的是AAR  E型的连接器
<5-6,Man in seat behind>They actually use the AAR type E coupler.

134
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,770
<5-6,Man in seat behind>如果你在火车头分开连接时仔细听
<5-6,Man in seat behind>If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects,

135
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,960
<5-6,Man in seat behind>你就能听到连接处
<5-6,Man in seat behind>you'll hear the characteristic

142
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,480
<6-3,Leonard>喊的有点晚  不过我也接受了
<6-3,Leonard>It's a little late, but I'll take it.

143
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,210
<6-4,Penny>不是啦  小桂子把巧克力都吃了
<6-4,Penny>No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates.

144
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,000
<6-4,Penny>巧克力会让狗狗致命的
<6-4,Penny>That's really bad for dogs.

145
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,870
<6-4,Penny>巧克力中含有可可碱  会作用于小狗的中枢神经和心肌
<6-4,Penny>从而让狗狗中毒

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,870
<6-5,Leonard>糟糕  那我们该怎么办
<6-5,Leonard>Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?

147
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,540
<6-6,Penny>我们应该立刻带她去看兽医
<6-6,Penny>We gotta get her to a vet right now.

148
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,860
<6-7,Leonard>我不认识兽医
<6-7,Leonard>I don't have a vet.

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,060
<6-7,Leonard>还有治皮肤病和泌尿科的医生
<6-7,Leonard>a dermatologist, a urologist.

151
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,250
<6-7,Leonard>怪不得你会觉得我认识兽医
<6-7,Leonard>You'd think I'd have a vet.

152
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,430
<6-8,Penny>离这不远有个兽医  咱们赶紧带她去
<6-8,Penny>Okay. There's one not far from here. Come on. Let's go.

158
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,370
<7-2,Man>飞驰在东部走廊线上的印象
<7-2,Man>barreling down the Eastern Corridor.

159
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,310
<7-3,Sheldon>你的嘴真能"跑火车"啊
<7-3,Sheldon>It's like there's a train in your mouth.

<7-4,Man>我坐过那趟火车
<7-4,Man>I've been on that train.

163
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,350
<7-4,Man>刚仿佛让我置身其中
<7-4,Man>And I just was again.

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,620
<7-5,Amy>看看你们能不能猜到我是什么意思
<7-5,Amy>Hey, see if you guys can guess this one.

<7-7,Man>现在就领领救济金  坐坐火车来打发时间
<7-7,Man>Now I just collect disability and ride trains.

173
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,590
<7-10,Amy>我干嘛要做这种无谓的尝试
<7-10,Amy>Why do I even try?

218
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,250
<9-1,Man>什么是美国建造过最棒的
<9-1,Man>Okay, what was the best four-ten-four

219
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,110
<9-1,Man>4-10-4设计类型的火车头是哪款
<9-1,Man>U.S. Locomotive ever built?

220
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,540
<9-2,Sheldon>这是陷阱题  因为从来就没有建过
<9-2,Sheldon>Trick question. There never was one.

221
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,650
<9-3,Man>抑或曾经有过
<9-3,Man>Or was there?

222
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,850
<9-4,Sheldon>神马
<9-4,Sheldon>What?!

223
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,050
<9-5,Man>1944年  太平洋铁路公司建造出第6131号火车头
<9-5,Man>In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131,

224
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,960
<9-5,Man>重新配置了传动器和气缸

225
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,510
<9-5,Man>解决了Q-1的问题
<9-5,Man>solving the problem of the Q-1,

226
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,700
<9-5,Man>并创造了双驱动的4-4-6-4型
<9-5,Man>creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.

227
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,020
<9-6,Sheldon>在哪个美好世界
<9-6,Sheldon>In what world is

228
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,350
<9-6,Sheldon>4-4-6-4会是4-10-4啊
<9-6,Sheldon>a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?

229
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,370
<9-7,Howard>一个我不想存在的世界
<9-7,Howard>A world I don't want to live in!

230
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,230
<9-7,Howard>说真的  我有种股想"与世长辞"的冲动
<9-7,Howard>Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.

231
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,100
<9-8,Man>戴上你车长思考帽
<9-8,Man>Hold on to your conductor's hat.

232
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,990
<9-8,Man>如果你曲柄转动第二个和第三个车轴
<9-8,Man>You crank the second and third axles,

233
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,390
<9-8,Man>创造出一对内部连杆
<9-8,Man>creating a pair of internal connecting rods,

234
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,620
<9-8,Man>4-10-4型就诞生啦
<9-8,Man>and boom-- four-ten-four.

235
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,030
<9-8,Man>如果你仔细想想  Q2型
<9-8,Man>If you think about it, the Q-2

236
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,180
<9-8,Man>就像是美国从未创造出的4-10-4型号
<9-8,Man>was like the four-ten-four America never made.

237
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,720
<9-9,Sheldon>这下我会忍不住一直想的
<9-9,Sheldon>I may never stop thinking about it.

238
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,310
<9-9,Sheldon>艾米  我们能遇见这家伙的几率是多少啊
<9-9,Sheldon>Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?

239
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,670
<9-10,Waiter>比你想象中多得多
<9-10,Waiter>Better than you think.

240
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,380
<9-11,Man>如果你客气地问乘务员
<9-11,Man>You know, if you ask nicely,

241
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,410
<9-11,Man>他们会让你去参观引擎舱
<9-11,Man>they'll let you visit the engine room.

242
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,360
<9-12,Sheldon>我希望这一天永不结束
<9-12,Sheldon>I never want this day to end.

243
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,190
<9-13,Amy>已经感觉像永远不会结束了
<9-13,Amy>It's feeling like it never will.

244
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,680
<9-14,Sheldon>走吧
<9-14,Sheldon>Come on.

245
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,700
<9-15,Man>我有告诉你  我当快递时发生过什么意外吗
<9-15,Man>Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?

246
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,710
<10-1,Raj>好像情人节对我的打击还不够大
<10-1,Raj>As if Valentine's Day wasn't bad enough,

247
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,270
<10-1,Raj>你们还想害死我的狗
<10-1,Raj>you try to kill my dog?!

248
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,430
<10-1,Raj>居然还是用便宜的巧克力
<10-1,Raj>And with cheap chocolate, no less?

249
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,000
<10-2,Penny>那不是便宜货
<10-2,Penny>It wasn't cheap.

250
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,040
<10-2,Penny>那是免费白送的
<10-2,Penny>It was free.

251
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,560
<10-3,Leonard>我们真的很抱歉  那是个意外
<10-3,Leonard>We're really sorry. It was an accident.

252
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,340
<10-4,Penny>对啊  我们不在客厅也没多久
<10-4,Penny>Yeah, we weren't even out of the room that long.

253
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,250
<10-5,Leonard>拜托  好一阵子好吗
<10-5,Leonard>Oh, no, come on. It was a while.

254
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,030
<10-5,Leonard>好一阵子呢
<10-5,Leonard>It was a while.

255
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,950
<10-6,Raj>小桂子没事吧
<10-6,Raj>Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?

256
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,110
<10-7,Vet>她反应良好
<10-7,Vet>She's responding well.

257
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,750
<10-7,Vet>我们只需要要她留院多观察一会
<10-7,Vet>We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.

258
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,150
<10-8,Raj>好的  可以让我进去看看她吗
<10-8,Raj>All right. Uh, would-would it be okay for me to see her?

259
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,520
<10-8,Raj>平常这时候我们都上床睡觉了
<10-8,Raj>We're usually in bed by now,

260
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,770
<10-8,Raj>我想让她知道  我就在她身边
<10-8,Raj>and I want her to know that I'm here.

261
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,710
<10-8,Raj>是啦  我们同睡一张床  有时还跟对方抱抱
<10-8,Raj>Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.

262
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,180
<10-9,Vet>没关系  我也跟我的狗狗一起睡
<10-9,Vet>It's okay. I sleep with my dog, too.

263
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,110
<10-9,Vet>虽然有规定不让外人进去
<10-9,Vet>We're not supposed to let people in back,

264
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,750
<10-9,Vet>但我可以破例一次
<10-9,Vet>but I think I can make an exception.

265
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,780
<10-10,Raj>-谢谢你  -进去吧
<10-10,Raj>- Thank you. - Come on.

266
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,380
<10-11,Vet>对了  我唱水果姐姐的歌给她听了
<10-11,Vet>By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.

267
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,910
<10-12,Raj>-是吗  -我才不管
<10-12,Raj>- Oh, yeah? - And I don't care

268
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,530
<10-13,Vet>里面那只令人讨厌的鹦鹉在嚷什么
<10-13,Vet>what that obnoxious parrot back there says.

269
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,400
<10-13,Vet>姐唱得可棒了
<10-13,Vet>I crushed it.

270
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,000
<10-14,Penny>我觉得他们俩之间会擦出爱的火花哟
<10-14,Penny>I think there's something going on between the two of them.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,650
<10-15,Leonard>或许吧  但你也觉得九分钟不算久
<10-15,Leonard>Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn't a while,

272
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,510
<10-15,Leonard>所以你懂个屁啊
<10-15,Leonard>so what do you know?

273
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,780
<11-1,Howard>-你没事吧  -干嘛这么问
<11-1,Howard>- You okay? - Why?

274
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,340
<11-2,Amy>因为我男友跟某个怪胎一起去玩火车了吗
<11-2,Amy>Because my boyfriend's off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?

275
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,140
<11-3,Howard>凭良心说  他俩都是怪胎
<11-3,Howard>Well, to be fair, they're both weirdos.

276
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,140
<11-4,Amy>我居然会以为今晚他会有所不同
<11-4,Amy>I don't know what made me think tonight would be any different.

277
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,300
<11-5,Bernadette>你能让他来这里  就已经很了不起了
<11-5,Bernadette>Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot.

278
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,920
<11-5,Bernadette>说实话  我跟华仔赌两百块
<11-5,Bernadette>To be honest, I bet Howie 200 bucks

279
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,120
<11-5,Bernadette>说谢尔顿不可能会来
<11-5,Bernadette>it wasn't gonna happen.

280
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,010
<11-6,Howard>这下我能去乐高积木店买个超酷的R2机器人了
<11-6,Howard>I'm going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.

281
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,350
<11-7,Bernadette>瞧  不仅是谢尔顿
<11-7,Bernadette>See? It's not just Sheldon.

282
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,070
<11-7,Bernadette>男人全是白痴
<11-7,Bernadette>They're all idiots.

283
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,040
<11-8,Howard>她说得对
<11-8,Howard>She's right.

284
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,690
<11-9,Bernadette>你男友是个待整改户又如何
<11-9,Bernadette>So, your boyfriend's a fixer-upper.

285
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,930
<11-9,Bernadette>大多数男人都是
<11-9,Bernadette>Most of them are.

286
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,860
<11-9,Bernadette>看这个家伙
<11-9,Bernadette>I mean, look at this guy.

287
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,240
<11-9,Bernadette>你觉得他生来就这么乖巧吗
<11-9,Bernadette>You think he came like this?

288
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,190
<11-9,Bernadette>我认识他时  他只是个性感的笨阿呆
<11-9,Bernadette>When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess.

289
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,420
<11-9,Bernadette>现在他连太空都去过了
<11-9,Bernadette>Now, he's been to space.

290
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,620
<11-9,Bernadette>全是姐教育有方
<11-9,Bernadette>That's all me.

291
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,530
<11-10,Howard>也有点我自己的因素吧
<11-10,Howard>I had a little to do with it.

292
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,890
<11-11,Bernadette>当然啦
<11-11,Bernadette>Oh, sure you did.

<12-1,Leonard>他们都进去半个小时了
<12-1,Leonard>They've been in there, like, half an hour.

296
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,650
<12-2,Penny>为以后定个标准  这时间才能算"好一阵"
<12-2,Penny>Yeah, for future reference, that's a while.

<13-23,Sheldon>Did you mean that,

351
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,740
<13-23,Sheldon>还是只是想骗我来
