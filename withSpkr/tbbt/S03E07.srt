1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,190
<1-1,Penny>哇  谢尔顿  真不敢相信你居然自创了游戏
<1-1,Penny>Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,390
<1-2,Sheldon>"研究实验室"可不仅仅是游戏
<1-2,Sheldon>Oh, "Research Lab" is more than a game.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,350
<1-2,Sheldon>就像这标语写的  "物理虽然只存在于理论中
<1-2,Sheldon>It's like the slogan says: "The physics is theoretical,

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,250
<1-2,Sheldon>但其中的快乐却是实实在在的"
<1-2,Sheldon>but the fun is real."

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,890
<1-3,Leonard>那我们现在肯定玩的不对
<1-3,Leonard>We must not be playing it right.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,420
<1-4,Penny>好  五
<1-4,Penny>All right, five.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,020
<1-4,Penny>一  二  三  四  五
<1-4,Penny>One, two, three, four, five.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,350
<1-4,Penny>喔  看呐
<1-4,Penny>Oh, wow, look at that.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,090
<1-4,Penny>我的国防部科研资金再度下拨
<1-4,Penny>My Department of Defense research grant is renewed.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,090
<1-5,Sheldon>掷得好
<1-5,Sheldon>Oh! Great roll!

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,050
<1-5,Sheldon>现在你可以拆了你的苏式回旋加速器
<1-5,Sheldon>Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,920
<1-5,Sheldon>然后建造一个大型强子对撞机
<1-5,Sheldon>and build the large Hadron Collider.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,920
<1-6,Penny>吔
<1-6,Penny>Yay.

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,690
<1-7,Sheldon>你玩这个很有天赋  佩妮
<1-7,Sheldon>You're a natural at this, Penny.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,520
<1-7,Sheldon>作为首批第二版测试者  你们会在周日
<1-7,Sheldon>And as the first beta testers, you two'll have quite the edge

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,890
<1-7,Sheldon>与沃罗威茨和库萨帕里的对决上获得不小优势
<1-7,Sheldon>when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,850
<1-8,Leonard>天呐  谢尔顿
<1-8,Leonard>Oh, gee, Sheldon,

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,290
<1-8,Leonard>我不认为我们周日能来玩
<1-8,Leonard>I don't think we can play on Sunday.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,150
<1-9,Sheldon>为什么
<1-9,Sheldon>Why not?

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,290
<1-10,Leonard>原因佩妮现在告诉你
<1-10,Leonard>Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you.

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,720
<1-10,Leonard>佩妮
<1-10,Leonard>Penny?

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,150
<1-11,Penny>事实上  我要去机场接我的朋友贾斯汀
<1-11,Penny>Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,620
<1-12,Leonard>听到了吧  她必须去机场接她的朋友贾斯汀
<1-12,Leonard>There you go-- she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport.

24
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,920
<1-12,Leonard>而且我玩不了因为我要和她一起去  对吗
<1-12,Leonard>And I can't play 'cause I'm going with her-- right?

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,250
<1-13,Penny>对  如果你想的话
<1-13,Penny>Um, yeah, if you want.

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,750
<1-13,Penny>我是说  车子也许没有空间了
<1-13,Penny>I mean, there may not be room.

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,450
<1-13,Penny>他带了好多东西  比如吉他和放大器什么的
<1-13,Penny>He's got a lot of stuff--like guitars and amplifiers...

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,650
<1-14,Leonard>等等
<1-14,Leonard>Wait.

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,350
<1-14,Leonard>你在说什么呢
<1-14,Leonard>What are you talking about?

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,550
<1-15,Penny>我朋友贾斯汀
<1-15,Penny>My friend Justin.

31
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,690
<1-16,Sheldon>注意力集中点  莱纳德
<1-16,Sheldon>Pay attention, Leonard.

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,950
<1-16,Sheldon>这是她周日不能来的原因
<1-16,Sheldon>That's why she can't play on Sunday.

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,450
<1-17,Leonard>这个贾斯汀是谁
<1-17,Leonard>Who is this Justin?

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,190
<1-20,Leonard>-到你了  莱纳德  -我跟你提过他
<1-20,Leonard>- Your turn, Leonard.  - I told you about him.

35
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,820
<1-21,Sheldon>-你没有  -掷骰子  莱纳德
<1-21,Sheldon>- No, you didn't. - Roll the dice, Leonard.

36
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,220
<1-22,Penny>有的  我一个来自奥马哈并玩吉他的朋友
<1-22,Penny>Yeah-- my friend from Omaha; plays the guitar.

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,220
<1-22,Penny>不论如何  他要来洛杉矶找些演奏的工作
<1-22,Penny>Anyway, he's coming to L.A. looking for some session work,

38
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,450
<1-22,Penny>所以我跟他说可以在我家的沙发上睡几个星期
<1-22,Penny>so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,490
<1-23,Sheldon>快点  莱纳德  如果你掷了六
<1-23,Sheldon>Come on, Leonard--if you roll a six,

40
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,690
<1-23,Sheldon>佩妮就会在核外泄中惨死
<1-23,Sheldon>Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown.

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,750
<1-23,Sheldon>明白我为什么说乐趣是实实在在的了吗
<1-23,Sheldon>See what I mean when I say the fun is real?

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,920
<1-24,Leonard>等等
<1-24,Leonard>Hang on.

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,150
<1-24,Leonard>某男要去睡你的沙发
<1-24,Leonard>Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?

44
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,490
<1-25,Penny>他不是"某男"
<1-25,Penny>He's not "some guy."

45
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,720
<1-25,Penny>他是我朋友
<1-25,Penny>He's my friend.

46
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,920
<1-26,Leonard>你说的"朋友"  是指"朋友般的朋友"
<1-26,Leonard>So by "friend," do you mean "friend friend,"

47
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,790
<1-26,Leonard>"同性恋朋友"还是
<1-26,Leonard>"gay friend," or "ex-boyfriend

48
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,050
<1-26,Leonard>"前男友兼现在你正柏拉图式暗恋
<1-26,Leonard>"who you're now platonic with

49
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,320
<1-26,Leonard>且有可能发生关系的朋友"
<1-26,Leonard>but still might have a thing for you friend"?

50
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,050
<1-27,Penny>他肯定不是同性恋
<1-27,Penny>Well, he's definitely not gay.

51
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,150
<1-28,Leonard>肯定不是同性恋的音乐人
<1-28,Leonard>Oh, ho-ho, a definitely not gay musician

52
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,120
<1-28,Leonard>睡在我女朋友的沙发上
<1-28,Leonard>sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

53
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,120
<1-28,Leonard>真开心
<1-28,Leonard>Yippee.

54
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,220
<1-29,Penny>好吧  我们很久之前是曾经拍拖过
<1-29,Penny>Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago.

55
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,290
<1-29,Penny>但绝对不是正在拍拖
<1-29,Penny>But we were never like "going out."

56
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,550
<1-30,Leonard>不是为了表示我很有学问  但是上一次我查证
<1-30,Leonard>Okay, not to be pedantic, but last I checked

57
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,550
<1-30,Leonard>"曾经拍拖"实际上是"正在拍拖的"过去式
<1-30,Leonard>"went out" was in fact the past tense of "going out"--

58
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,190
<1-30,Leonard>并且地球人都知道这是"坦诚相见"的
<1-30,Leonard>which I think we all know is a popular euphemism

59
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,220
<1-30,Leonard>委婉说法
<1-30,Leonard>for "saw each other naked."

60
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,890
<1-31,Sheldon>干脆我来替你掷好了
<1-31,Sheldon>I'll just roll for you.

61
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,250
<1-32,Penny>你对贾斯汀跟我住有意见吗
<1-32,Penny>Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?

62
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,820
<1-33,Leonard>你当初是怎么想的
<1-33,Leonard>What was your first clue?

63
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,850
<1-34,Sheldon>糟糕  工业事故
<1-34,Sheldon>Uh-oh! Industrial accident.

64
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,750
<1-35,Penny>告诉你  跟我说话的时候别把我当白痴
<1-35,Penny>You know what? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

65
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,220
<1-36,Leonard>我跟你说话时没把你当做白痴
<1-36,Leonard>I'm not talking to you like you're an idiot!

66
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,650
<1-36,Leonard>我是说这整件事很愚蠢
<1-36,Leonard>I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!

67
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,890
<1-37,Sheldon>"你一不小心直视氦氩激光
<1-37,Sheldon>"You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser.

68
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,590
<1-37,Sheldon>暂停一轮并失去一只眼睛的视网膜"
<1-37,Sheldon>Lose one turn and a retina."

69
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,720
<1-38,Penny>难道你不是把我当白痴
<1-38,Penny>How is that not talking to me like I'm an idiot?

70
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,520
<1-38,Penny>那是我的朋友  我的沙发
<1-38,Penny>It's my friend, it's my couch,

71
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,520
<1-38,Penny>是我TM自己的生活
<1-38,Penny>and it's my freakin' life!

72
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,420
<1-39,Sheldon>也到你掷骰子了
<1-39,Sheldon>It's also your roll.

73
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,290
<1-40,Leonard>没错  那是你的生活
<1-40,Leonard>You know what? It is your life.

74
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,720
<1-40,Leonard>你要是想让什么狗屁吉他手睡你的沙发上  随你
<1-40,Leonard>If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine!

75
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,750
<1-40,Leonard>那你干嘛不租几张
<1-40,Leonard>Why don't you just rent

76
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,320
<1-40,Leonard>双层床然后把黑眼豆豆请来
<1-40,Leonard>some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?!

77
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,950
<1-41,Penny>听着  如果我想邀请整个洛拉帕罗扎音乐节的
<1-41,Penny>Hey, if I want to invite the entire lineup of Lollapalooza

78
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,550
<1-41,Penny>阵容来我公寓睡觉  我绝对会的
<1-41,Penny>to sleep in my apartment, I will,

79
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,750
<1-41,Penny>而且这与你无关
<1-41,Penny>and it's none of your business!

80
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,850
<1-42,Leonard>你在听自己都说了些什么吗
<1-42,Leonard>Are you listening to yourself?

81
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,290
<1-42,Leonard>你知道你现在听起来是多么的小孩子气吗
<1-42,Leonard>Do you know how childish you sound right now?

82
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,420
<1-43,Penny>哦  现在我变小孩子了
<1-43,Penny>Oh, now I'm a child?

83
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,920
<1-43,Penny>至少我再也不是白痴了
<1-43,Penny>Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!

84
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,620
<1-44,Leonard>这两个词可不是互斥的
<1-44,Leonard>The two aren't mutually exclusive!

85
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,250
<1-45,Penny>你真是个...
<1-45,Penny>Oh, you are such a--

86
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,250
<1-45,Penny>他这是TMD在干嘛呢
<1-45,Penny>What the hell is he doing?!

87
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,490
<1-46,Leonard>他要把我们逼出去
<1-46,Leonard>He's drowning us out.

88
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,990
<1-46,Leonard>他不喜欢吵架
<1-46,Leonard>He doesn't like fighting.

89
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,950
<1-47,Penny>谢尔顿  快停下来  吵架结束了
<1-47,Penny>Sheldon, just stop! Look, the fight is over!

90
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,690
<1-47,Penny>还有  仅供参考
<1-47,Penny>Oh, and FYI,

91
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,490
<1-47,Penny>你在遇到我之前根本就没听说过
<1-47,Penny>you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas

92
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,450
<1-47,Penny>黑眼豆豆
<1-47,Penny>until you met me!

93
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
<1-48,Leonard>我听说过他们
<1-48,Leonard>I heard of 'em!

94
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,050
<1-48,Leonard>只不过不知道他们是个组合罢了
<1-48,Leonard>Didn't know they were a band.

95
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,220
<1-48,Leonard>谢尔顿  她已经走了
<1-48,Leonard>Sheldon, she's gone.

96
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,590
<1-48,Leonard>你可以关掉搅拌机了
<1-48,Leonard>You can turn off the blender.

97
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,720
<1-49,Sheldon>你的恋爱关系已经到了一定要丑陋结束的地步吗
<1-49,Sheldon>Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?

98
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,420
<1-50,Leonard>不  我们只是有了点小争执
<1-50,Leonard>No, we just had a little spat.

99
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,090
<1-51,Sheldon>往好的一面想想
<1-51,Sheldon>Look on the bright side.

100
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,050
<1-51,Sheldon>作为对佩妮的惩罚
<1-51,Sheldon>As a result of Penny's forfeit

101
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,820
<1-51,Sheldon>你成为了世界首位"研究实验室"的胜者
<1-51,Sheldon>you have become the world's first winner of "Research Lab."

102
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,820
<1-51,Sheldon>你要来份纪念沙冰吗
<1-51,Sheldon>Would you like a commemorative snow cone?

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
<1-51,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-51,Sheldon>第三季第七集

104
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,800
<1-51,Sheldon>我真不明白她怎么就这么直接宣布
<1-51,Sheldon>I don't get how she can just announce

105
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,240
<2-1,Leonard>她的前男友要来睡她沙发上
<2-1,Leonard>that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,800
<2-2,Sheldon>我想到了一个在车里能玩的游戏
<2-2,Sheldon>Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.

107
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,270
<2-3,Leonard>我不想玩游戏  谢尔顿
<2-3,Leonard>I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.

108
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,500
<2-4,Sheldon>游戏名字叫"科学家"
<2-4,Sheldon>It's called "Scientists."

109
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,540
<2-4,Sheldon>现在  我会说出三个科学家的名字
<2-4,Sheldon>Now, I will name three scientists,

110
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,100
<2-4,Sheldon>然后你对他们排序
<2-4,Sheldon>then you will put them in order

111
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,500
<2-4,Sheldon>根据他们对各自领域的贡献大小
<2-4,Sheldon>of the size of their contribution to their respective fields.

112
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,470
<2-4,Sheldon>为了让这个游戏更有趣
<2-4,Sheldon>To make this game even more compelling,

113
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,600
<2-4,Sheldon>你必须只考虑这个人
<2-4,Sheldon>you must consider only the contribution

114
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,870
<2-4,Sheldon>对这个领域做出的贡献
<2-4,Sheldon>of the man to the field,

115
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,140
<2-4,Sheldon>不论这个领域的理论到底是对是错
<2-4,Sheldon>not the validity of the field itself.

116
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,600
<2-4,Sheldon>比如说阿布·穆萨·贾比尔·伊本·哈扬
<2-4,Sheldon>For example: Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan

117
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,740
<2-4,Sheldon>对臭名昭著的炼金术做出的贡献
<2-4,Sheldon>made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy

118
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
<2-4,Sheldon>比霍伯特·范德普莱特在神经生物学中的贡献要大得多
<2-4,Sheldon>than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology.

119
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,640
<2-4,Sheldon>好了  准备好来点乐子了吗
<2-4,Sheldon>Okay, ready to have some fun?

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,640
<2-5,Leonard>一个绝对不是同性恋的前男友
<2-5,Leonard>An old boyfriend who's definitely not gay.

121
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,500
<2-5,Leonard>还是人们最喜欢听的-- "绝对的"
<2-5,Leonard>That's what a guy likes to hear-- "definitely."

122
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,300
<2-6,Sheldon>好的  我先来个简单的
<2-6,Sheldon>All right, I'll start with an easy one:

123
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,870
<2-6,Sheldon>艾萨克·牛顿  居里夫人和尼尔斯·玻尔
<2-6,Sheldon>Um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.

124
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,600
<2-7,Leonard>然后我只说了一点点最后却成了坏人
<2-7,Leonard>And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!

125
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,870
<2-8,Sheldon>提示  居里夫人有她的丈夫帮她
<2-8,Sheldon>Hint: Madame Curie had her husband to help her.

126
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,370
<2-9,Leonard>我能说什么
<2-9,Leonard>What am I supposed to say?

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,770
<2-9,Leonard>当然  佩妮  你让旧相好在家过夜
<2-9,Leonard>"Sure, Penny, I'm cool with your old boyfriend

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,200
<2-9,Leonard>我完全没意见
<2-9,Leonard>sleeping in your apartment."

129
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,370
<2-9,Leonard>莱纳德  你有没有意见不重要
<2-9,Leonard>"Well, Leonard, it doesn't matter if you're cool or not

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,940
<2-9,Leonard>因为本美女佩妮
<2-9,Leonard>"because I'm Penny and I'm pretty

131
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,540
<2-9,Leonard>喜欢干啥就干啥
<2-9,Leonard>and I can do whatever the hell I want!"

132
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,300
<2-9,Leonard>我懂了
<2-9,Leonard>"Oh, I get it!

133
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,040
<2-9,Leonard>你觉得和我在一起
<2-9,Leonard>"You think you're doing me a favor just by

134
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,200
<2-9,Leonard>只是在同情我
<2-9,Leonard>being in a relationship with me!"

135
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,740
<2-9,Leonard>不  莱纳德  我能跟你同处一室
<2-9,Leonard>"No, no, Leonard! I'doing you a favor

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,200
<2-9,Leonard>就已经是同情你了
<2-9,Leonard>just by being in the same room as you!"

137
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,570
<2-10,Sheldon>莱纳德  停车
<2-10,Sheldon>Leonard! Stop the car!

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,500
<2-11,Leonard>怎么了
<2-11,Leonard>What?

139
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,800
<2-12,Sheldon>我不想再听你们吵架了
<2-12,Sheldon>I can't listen to the two of you fight anymore.

140
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
<3-1,Sheldon>快  速度  要迟到了
<3-1,Sheldon>Come on, come on, we're late.

141
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,100
<3-2,Leonard>淡定  我们能赶上电影
<3-2,Leonard>Calm down. We'll make the movie.

142
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,700
<3-3,Sheldon>根据现在的情况  我的警告是对的
<3-3,Sheldon>I believe my alarm is appropriate,given the situation.

143
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,540
<3-3,Sheldon>电影17分钟后开始
<3-3,Sheldon>The movie starts in 17 minutes,

144
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,540
<3-3,Sheldon>也就是说我们得赶上科罗拉多大道的全部绿灯
<3-3,Sheldon>which means we'll need to make all the lights

145
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,940
<3-3,Sheldon>而且不能去买东西吃了
<3-3,Sheldon>on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand,

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,300
<3-3,Sheldon>开场前也不能去尿尿了
<3-3,Sheldon>and preshow urination.

147
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,240
<3-4,Raj>兄台  我刚灌下一瓶红牛时
<3-4,Raj>Oh, dude, I wish you had said something

148
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,840
<3-4,Raj>你咋不说话
<3-4,Raj>before I pounded that last Red Bull.

154
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,040
<3-8,Sheldon>我们站在走廊里
<3-8,Sheldon>We're standing in the hallway,

155
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,770
<3-8,Sheldon>忍受你们尴尬的相遇
<3-8,Sheldon>suffering through an awkward encounter.

158
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,600
<3-9,Leonard>你不会想看的  对吧
<3-9,Leonard>You wouldn't want to come, would you?

159
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,200
<3-10,Penny>一点都不想
<3-10,Penny>Not really, no.

160
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,000
<3-11,Sheldon>好了  毫无意义的邀请说了
<3-11,Sheldon>All right, invitation pointlessly offered,

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,470
<3-11,Sheldon>不出意料地被谢绝了

168
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,230
<3-16,Leonard>不

169
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,100
<3-17,Penny>答案错误

172
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,240
<3-18,Leonard>这也太傻逼了
<3-18,Leonard>This is stupid.

173
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,270
<3-19,Penny>又来了
<3-19,Penny>Oh, there it is again!

174
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
<3-19,Penny>你觉得我很傻逼
<3-19,Penny>You think I'm stupid!

175
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,470
<3-20,Leonard>不  人傻和行为愚蠢
<3-20,Leonard>No, there's a difference

176
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,170
<3-20,Leonard>是不一样的
<3-20,Leonard>between being stupid and acting stupid.

177
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,370
<3-21,Penny>是吗  那混球和混蛋
<3-21,Penny>Oh, yeah? well, there's a difference

178
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,240
<3-21,Penny>也很不一样呢
<3-21,Penny>between being a jerk and being an ass!

179
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,470
<3-22,Leonard>才怪
<3-22,Leonard>No, there isn't!

180
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,700
<3-22,Leonard>两个是同义词
<3-22,Leonard>They're synonyms!

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,170
<3-23,Raj>场面相当不愉快啊
<3-23,Raj>Well, that was rather unpleasant.

182
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,170
<3-24,Howard>开场前我都不用尿尿了
<3-24,Howard>Yeah, I don't think I need my preshow urination anymore.

183
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,900
<3-25,Sheldon>莱纳德  那女的三年前搬进来时
<3-25,Sheldon>Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago,

184
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,700
<3-25,Sheldon>我就告诉你不要搭理她  现在好了
<3-25,Sheldon>I told you not to talk to her, and now look,

185
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,940
<3-25,Sheldon>电影我们是迟到定了
<3-25,Sheldon>we're going to be late for the movies.

<4-1,Howard>哟  《神奇蜘蛛侠》183
<4-1,Howard>Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.

<4-2,Sheldon>买了
<4-2,Sheldon>Got it.

188
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,470
<4-3,Howard>记得这本吗
<4-3,Howard>Remember this one?

189
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,800
<4-3,Howard>蜘蛛侠之一败涂地
<4-3,Howard>Spider-Man loses a big fight

190
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,300
<4-3,Howard>接着女朋友还跟他分手了
<4-3,Howard>and then his girl friend breaks up with him.

191
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,330
<4-3,Howard>要我买给你吗
<4-3,Howard>Want me to get it for you?

192
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,200
<4-3,Howard>能帮你转移一下注意力
<4-3,Howard>It'll help take your mind off things.

193
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,870
<4-4,Stuart>伙计们  怎么回事
<4-4,Stuart>Hey, guys. What's going on?

194
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,530
<4-5,Leonard>等下一场《时光大盗》放映前
<4-5,Leonard>Oh, we need to kill a couple hours

195
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,430
<4-5,Leonard>我们得在这消磨几小时
<4-5,Leonard>till the next showing of Time Bandits.

196
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,330
<4-6,Stuart>没问题
<4-6,Stuart>Oh, well,no problem.

197
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,100
<4-6,Stuart>我还想早点打烊回家
<4-6,Stuart>I was thinking of closing early and going home,

198
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,570
<4-6,Stuart>但面对现实吧
<4-6,Stuart>but let's face it,

199
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,370
<4-6,Stuart>我家也只不过是间小一点的
<4-6,Stuart>that's just a slightly smaller lonely room

200
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,300
<4-6,Stuart>堆满漫画书的孤舍
<4-6,Stuart>filled with comic book

201
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,000
<4-7,Leonard>谢谢  斯图尔特
<4-7,Leonard>Thanks, Stuart.

202
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,300
<4-7,Leonard>我问你
<4-7,Leonard>Let me ask you something.

203
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,770
<4-7,Leonard>你觉得佩妮让老相好
<4-7,Leonard>Do you think it's okay for Penny

204
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,570
<4-7,Leonard>在自己家过夜合适吗
<4-7,Leonard>to have an ex-boyfrid sleep on her couch?

205
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,270
<4-8,Howard>当然不好  她明显太过分了
<4-8,Howard>No, I mean, she's obviousl way out of line.

206
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,270
<4-9,Leonard>谢谢
<4-9,Leonard>Thank you!

207
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,630
<4-10,Howard>但如果她把你甩了
<4-10,Howard>But if she dumps you,

208
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,170
<4-10,Howard>她第二天就能找个新欢
<4-10,Howard>she'll have a new boyfrien by tomorrow morning

209
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,330
<4-10,Howard>而你得想办法自己做一个娃娃
<4-10,Howard>and you'll have a new girl friend

210
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,330
<4-10,Howard>才能算有新欢
<4-10,Howard>when you figure out how to build one.

211
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,370
<4-10,Howard>唯一的疑问是  你什么时候才举白旗
<4-10,Howard>So the only question is: how long until you fold?

212
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,170
<4-11,Leonard>我才不会举白旗
<4-11,Leonard>I am not going to fold.

213
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,530
<4-12,Raj>等等  我不觉得
<4-12,Raj>Well, excuse me, I don't think

214
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,830
<4-12,Raj>佩妮有丝毫过分之处
<4-12,Raj>Penny's out of line at all.

215
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,230
<4-12,Raj>她又不是你的人
<4-12,Raj>You don't own her.

216
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,030
<4-12,Raj>正如我的女神碧昂斯说的
<4-12,Raj>It's like my girl Beyonce says:

217
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,570
<4-12,Raj>你要是喜欢塔  就该向他求婚
<4-12,Raj>"If you like it, you should put a ring on it."

218
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,800
<4-12,Raj>得了吧
<4-12,Raj>Come on.

219
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,000
<4-13,Howard>最起码
<4-13,Howard>At the very least,

220
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,330
<4-13,Howard>佩妮发现莱纳德为此不高兴
<4-13,Howard>when she found out Leonard was upset about it,

221
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,070
<4-13,Howard>她就应该退让
<4-13,Howard>she should've backed off.

222
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,330
<4-14,Raj>你是说正如某人不高兴
<4-14,Raj>You mean like when a guy's upset

223
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
<4-14,Raj>因为他朋友答应和他去上烹饪课
<4-14,Raj>because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him

224
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,200
<4-14,Raj>结果却放鸽子
<4-14,Raj>and then doesn't show up

225
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,700
<4-14,Raj>因为他正和他妈进行果蔬汁断食
<4-14,Raj>because he's doing a juice fast with his mother?

226
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,970
<4-15,Howard>我不知道你为此不高兴
<4-15,Howard>I didn't know you were upset about that.

227
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,300
<4-16,Raj>是嘛  难道所有的暗示你都没看到
<4-16,Raj>Really! Did you miss all the subtitle indicators,

228
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,300
<4-16,Raj>比如"霍华德  我不高兴"
<4-16,Raj>like me saying, "Howard, I am upset."

229
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,570
<4-17,Howard>对不起  行了吧
<4-17,Howard>Okay, sorry.

230
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,970
<4-18,Raj>或许在这个国家的意义不同
<4-18,Raj>Maybe it means something different in this country.

231
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,930
<4-18,Raj>在印度  这表示我在生一个叫霍华德的小子的气
<4-18,Raj>Back in India, it means you're upset with a guy named Howard!

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,030
<4-19,Howard>我道过歉了
<4-19,Howard>I said I'm sorry.

233
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,300
<4-20,Raj>道歉也弥补不了
<4-20,Raj>Sorry doesn't make up for the fact

234
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,330
<4-20,Raj>我得和一个素食者做鸡肉饭
<4-20,Raj>that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy.

235
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,330
<4-20,Raj>你知道素鸡肉饭是什么吗
<4-20,Raj>Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is?

236
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,370
<4-20,Raj>就是米饭
<4-20,Raj>Rice!

237
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,330
<4-21,Howard>你以为我就很开心吗
<4-21,Howard>Yeah, well, you think I was having fun,

238
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,300
<4-21,Howard>整晚坐着听我妈唠叨
<4-21,Howard>sitting around all night listening to my mother say,

239
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,600
<4-21,Howard>你这辈子尿过这么多吗
<4-21,Howard>"Have you ever peed so much in your life?"

240
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,530
<4-22,Raj>天啊  你真是个恋娘狂
<4-22,Raj>Oh, my God, you are such a mama's boy.

241
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,270
<4-23,Howard>喂  别把我妈扯进来
<4-23,Howard>Hey, don't bring my mother into this!

242
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,730
<4-24,Raj>你自己把她扯进来的
<4-24,Raj>You brought your mother into this!

243
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,230
<4-25,Sheldon>别吵了  你们两个
<4-25,Sheldon>Stop it, both of you.

244
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,970
<4-25,Sheldon>听你们吵个不停
<4-25,Sheldon>All this fighting, I might as well

245
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,930
<4-25,Sheldon>简直就跟我爸妈一样  "该死的乔治"
<4-25,Sheldon>be back with my parents! "Damn it, George,

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,230
<4-25,Sheldon>"我说过你要是再不戒酒我就离开你"
<4-25,Sheldon>"I told you if you didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you!"

247
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,030
<4-25,Sheldon>"这只能说明你是个骗子"
<4-25,Sheldon>"Well, I guess that makes you a liar.

248
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,830
<4-25,Sheldon>"我已经醉成这样  你还没走"
<4-25,Sheldon>"'Cause I'm drunk as hell and you're still here!"

249
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,000
<4-25,Sheldon>"别嚷了"
<4-25,Sheldon>"Stop yelling!"

250
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,630
<4-25,Sheldon>"谢尔顿快被你弄哭了"
<4-25,Sheldon>"You're making Sheldon cry!"

251
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,430
<4-25,Sheldon>"告诉你谢尔顿为什么哭吧"
<4-25,Sheldon>"I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry!

252
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,270
<4-25,Sheldon>"因为我让你给他起了这个破名儿"
<4-25,Sheldon>That I let you name him Sheldon"

253
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,000
<4-26,Howard>老天  他干嘛这么生气
<4-26,Howard>Boy, what got him so upset?

254
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,000
<4-27,Raj>当然了  谢尔顿生气你倒能看出来了
<4-27,Raj>Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon's upset.

255
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,530
<5-1,Penny>多谢惠顾
<5-1,Penny>Oh, thank you very much.

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,970
<5-1,Penny>欢迎下次光临
<5-1,Penny>Come back soon.

257
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,630
<5-1,Penny>还有下次多给一半小费
<5-1,Penny>With the other half of my tip.

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,160
<5-1,Penny>嗨  谢尔顿
<5-1,Penny>Hey, Sheldon.

259
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,660
<5-1,Penny>你怎么在这儿
<5-1,Penny>What are you doing here?

260
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,830
<5-2,Sheldon>这是家餐馆
<5-2,Sheldon>This is a restaurant.

261
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,960
<5-2,Sheldon>而现在午餐时间
<5-2,Sheldon>It's lunchtime.

262
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,630
<5-2,Sheldon>我认为  作为一名女招待
<5-2,Sheldon>I would think, as a waitress,

263
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,730
<5-2,Sheldon>应该很熟悉这套程序了
<5-2,Sheldon>you'd be familiar withhe paradigm.

264
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,900
<5-3,Penny>莱纳德来吗
<5-3,Penny>Is Leonard coming?

265
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,860
<5-4,Sheldon>不来  我相信他正在等着你
<5-4,Sheldon>No, I believe Leonard is waiting

266
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,560
<5-4,Sheldon>回心转意  并向他道歉呢
<5-4,Sheldon>for yo to come crawling back to him and apologize.

267
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,800
<5-5,Penny>这绝不可能
<5-5,Penny>Well, that's not gonna happen.

268
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,300
<5-6,Sheldon>我猜也是
<5-6,Sheldon>I assumed that would be your attitude.

269
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,830
<5-6,Sheldon>所以我才因此到这儿来
<5-6,Sheldon>Hence, my true purpose coming here.

270
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,230
<5-8,Sheldon>-啥  -我要你回心转意去向他道歉
<5-8,Sheldon>- Which is? - I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.

271
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,230
<5-9,Penny>我忙呢
<5-9,Penny>I'm busy.

272
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,200
<5-10,Sheldon>不好意思  小姐
<5-10,Sheldon>Excuse me, Miss.

273
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,630
<5-10,Sheldon>我想要点餐
<5-10,Sheldon>I'like to order lunch.

274
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,160
<5-11,Penny>说  你要啥
<5-11,Penny>Fine. What do you want?

275
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,760
<5-12,Sheldon>我有些疑问
<5-12,Sheldon>I have a few questions.

276
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,760
<5-12,Sheldon>我先是注意到你们这有汤和半份三明治
<5-12,Sheldon>First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?

277
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,160
<5-13,Penny>没错
<5-13,Penny>Yes.

278
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,560
<5-14,Sheldon>半份三明治到底是怎么做的
<5-14,Sheldon>Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from?

279
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,830
<5-14,Sheldon>你是给我另一个人吃剩下的呢
<5-14,Sheldon>Are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich,

280
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,330
<5-14,Sheldon>还是我非要等到
<5-14,Sheldon>or do I have to wait

281
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,630
<5-14,Sheldon>另一个想点的人出现
<5-14,Sheldon>for someone else in the restaurant

282
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,860
<5-14,Sheldon>再和他一起合点呢
<5-14,Sheldon>to order the other half?

283
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,130
<5-15,Penny>不  谢尔顿  他们只是做出来而已
<5-15,Penny>No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.

284
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,960
<5-15,Penny>你没法做出半份三明治
<5-15,Penny>You can't make a half-sandwich.

285
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,960
<5-16,Sheldon>如果是整个三明治的一半
<5-16,Sheldon>If it's t half of a whole sandwich,

286
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,560
<5-16,Sheldon>那应该是个小号三明治
<5-16,Sheldon>it's just a small sandwich.

287
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,860
<5-17,Penny>得了  汤和小号三明治
<5-17,Penny>Okay, fine, it's soup and a small sandwich.

288
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,230
<5-17,Penny>你要点这些吗
<5-17,Penny>that what you want?

289
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,360
<5-18,Sheldon>当然不  我还是老样子
<5-18,Sheldon>Of course not. I'll have my usual.

290
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,630
<5-19,Penny>好
<5-19,Penny>Great.

291
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,200
<5-20,Sheldon>你不问我是否要饮料了吗
<5-20,Sheldon>Aren't you going to ask me if I want a beverage?

292
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,230
<5-21,Penny>你不是一直都喝柠檬汁吗
<5-21,Penny>Don't you usually get lemonade?

293
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,600
<5-23,Penny>-是  -你要柠檬汁吗
<5-23,Penny>- Yes. - Do you want lemonade?

294
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
<5-25,Penny>-是  -还需要什么吗
<5-25,Penny>- Yes. - Anything else?

295
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,800
<5-26,Sheldon>当然  我要你去向莱纳德道歉
<5-26,Sheldon>Yes-- I want you to apologize to Leonard.

296
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,160
<5-26,Sheldon>我绝不会去道歉
<5-26,Sheldon>I am not going to apologize.

297
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,260
<5-27,Penny>我又没错
<5-27,Penny>I've done nothing wrong.

298
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,460
<5-27,Penny>完全是他反应过度
<5-27,Penny>He is completely overreacting.

299
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,530
<5-28,Sheldon>这无关紧要
<5-28,Sheldon>Irrelevant.

300
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
<5-28,Sheldon>关键在于你们出了感情问题
<5-28,Sheldon>The disruption in your relaonship

301
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,260
<5-28,Sheldon>让我也难以忍受
<5-28,Sheldon>is making my life intolerable.

302
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,160
<5-29,Penny>抱歉  谢尔顿  但这真的与你无关
<5-29,Penny>Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.

303
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,030
<5-30,Sheldon>我不懂
<5-30,Sheldon>I don't follow.

304
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,800
<5-31,Penny>我马上来
<5-31,Penny>ah, yeah, I'll be right there.

305
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
<5-31,Penny>听着  谢尔顿  我得走了
<5-31,Penny>Look, Sheldon, I have to go.

306
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,230
<5-32,Sheldon>好吧  那我假设  当然是谬误论证
<5-32,Sheldon>All right, let's assume, ad argumentum,

307
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,000
<5-32,Sheldon>在这情况下  是莱纳德错了
<5-32,Sheldon>that in this case, Leonard is wrong.

308
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,530
<5-33,Penny>就是他的错
<5-33,Penny>Leonard is wrong.

309
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
<5-34,Sheldon>考虑到以前他对你的出轨行为
<5-34,Sheldon>Considering the number of transgressions

310
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,800
<5-34,Sheldon>视而不见的次数
<5-34,Sheldon>you've committed that he's overlooked,

311
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,230
<5-34,Sheldon>你就不能考虑下  就这次
<5-34,Sheldon>Don't you think that, just this once,

312
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,260
<5-34,Sheldon>算是回报他吗
<5-34,Sheldon>you could return the favor?

313
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,300
<5-34,Sheldon>我就来
<5-34,Sheldon>I'm coming.

314
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,460
<5-35,Penny>再见  谢尔顿
<5-35,Penny>Good-bye, Sheldon.

315
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,030
<5-35,Penny>什么叫我的出轨行为  啥意思
<5-35,Penny>What do you mean, transgressions I've committed?

316
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,330
<5-36,Sheldon>你还以为莱纳德
<5-36,Sheldon>Were you under the impression

317
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,330
<5-36,Sheldon>对你都毫无怨念吗
<5-36,Sheldon>that Leonard has no complaints about you?

318
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,930
<5-37,Penny>啥  喂那边的  我看到你了
<5-37,Penny>Like what?! Yeah, yeah, I see you.

319
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,860
<5-37,Penny>你对着空气划了一个勾
<5-37,Penny>You're making a little check sign in the air.

320
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,460
<5-37,Penny>知道了  耐心点别吵
<5-37,Penny>I got it. Just hold you horses.

321
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,700
<5-37,Penny>莱纳德抱怨我什么
<5-37,Penny>What does Leonard complain about?

322
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,160
<5-38,Sheldon>你驾驶技术差劲
<5-38,Sheldon>Your driving.

323
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,230
<5-38,Sheldon>你床上的布绒玩偶太多了
<5-38,Sheldon>The plethora of stuffed animals on your bed

324
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,560
<5-38,Sheldon>两人亲热的时候一直盯着他
<5-38,Sheldon>that stare at him during your amorous activities.

325
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,330
<5-38,Sheldon>你老是迟到  还有你的唱歌水平
<5-38,Sheldon>Your constant tardiness, your singing.

326
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,300
<5-39,Penny>我唱歌的水平
<5-39,Penny>My singing?

327
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,760
<5-40,Sheldon>这其实是我的看法之一
<5-40,Sheldon>That's actually from my list.

328
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,600
<5-40,Sheldon>但莱纳德会不同意我才怪呢
<5-40,Sheldon>But Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it.

329
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,400
<5-41,Penny>如果莱纳德对我有这么多意见
<5-41,Penny>Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me,

330
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,630
<5-41,Penny>他干嘛不直接了当地说出来
<5-41,Penny>Why hasn't he just said so?

331
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,600
<5-42,Sheldon>因为在他看来
<5-42,Sheldon>Because, according to him

332
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,230
<5-42,Sheldon>你脾气大又容易动怒
<5-42,Sheldon>you're oversensitive and have a temper.

333
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,330
<5-43,Penny>是吗
<5-43,Penny>Oh, really?

334
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,730
<5-43,Penny>那拜托你帮个忙
<5-43,Penny>Well, then, do me a favor

335
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,130
<5-43,Penny>告诉莱纳德  他好去死了
<5-43,Penny>and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!

336
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,730
<5-44,Sheldon>难怪她总是小费拿得少
<5-44,Sheldon>And she wonders why she's constantly undertipped.

337
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,800
<6-1,Leonard>好啊  你回来了
<6-1,Leonard>Oh, good, you're home.

338
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,300
<6-2,Sheldon>我要你帮我个忙
<6-2,Sheldon>I need you to do me a favor.

339
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,730
<6-3,Leonard>说吧
<6-3,Leonard>Sure.

340
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,900
<6-4,Sheldon>去向佩妮道歉
<6-4,Sheldon>Go apologize to Penny.

341
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,330
<6-6,Sheldon>-啥  -最好现在就去
<6-6,Sheldon>- What?! - Right now would be good.

342
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,900
<6-7,Penny (knocking)>莱纳德
<6-7,Penny (knocking)>Leonard!

343
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,260
<6-8,Sheldon>好吧  其实应该更早一点去
<6-8,Sheldon>Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.

344
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,700
<6-9,Penny>听说你不喜欢我床上的布绒玩偶
<6-9,Penny>I hear you don't like

345
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,030
<6-9,Penny>我的驾驶技术和我的准时程度
<6-9,Penny>My stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.

346
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,260
<6-10,Leonard>啥  谁告诉你的
<6-10,Leonard>What? Who would tell you something like that?

347
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,660
<6-10,Leonard>你干嘛告诉她
<6-10,Leonard>Why would you tell her something like that?

348
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,400
<6-11,Penny>他为什么告诉我不重要
<6-11,Penny>It doesn't matter why he told me.

349
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,440
<6-11,Penny>但这些都是真的  是吗
<6-11,Penny>It's true, isn't it?

350
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,600
<6-12,Leonard>没错  是真的
<6-12,Leonard>Okay, yeah, it's true,

351
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,140
<6-12,Leonard>但这些我都可以忍受
<6-12,Leonard>but I can live with that stuff.

352
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,640
<6-12,Leonard>但我不能忍受你事先不和我商量
<6-12,Leonard>What I can't live with is you casually informing me

353
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,800
<6-12,Leonard>只是随意地知会我一声说
<6-12,Leonard>that some guy's going to be staying your apartment

354
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,970
<6-12,Leonard>有个男人要住在你公寓里
<6-12,Leonard>wiout even asking me first!

355
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,200
<6-13,Penny>问题不在于此
<6-13,Penny>That isn't your problem!

356
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,000
<6-13,Penny>而在于你不信任我
<6-13,Penny>Your problem is you don't trust me!

357
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,170
<6-13,Penny>得了吧
<6-13,Penny>Oh, come on.

358
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,830
<6-14,Leonard>谢尔顿  你啥时有听我说过
<6-14,Leonard>Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say

359
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,500
<6-14,Leonard>我不信任佩妮了
<6-14,Leonard>that I don't trust Penny?

360
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,570
<6-14,Leonard>谢尔顿  他去哪儿了
<6-14,Leonard>Sheldon? Where did he go?

361
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,770
<6-15,Penny>你大吼大叫
<6-15,Penny>Oh, your yelling

362
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,140
<6-15,Penny>一定又把他吓跑了
<6-15,Penny>Must have freaked him out again.

363
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,240
<6-16,Leonard>你去哪儿
<6-16,Leonard>Where are you going?!

364
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,370
<6-16,Leonard>我们吵到一半
<6-16,Leonard>You just walk away

365
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,700
<6-16,Leonard>-你就这么一走了之吗  -才不是
<6-16,Leonard>- In the middle of aargument?! - No.

366
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,070
<6-17,Penny>我要去找你那天杀的室友
<6-17,Penny>I'm going to go find your damn roommate

367
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,200
<6-17,Penny>免得他做出伤害自己的傻事
<6-17,Penny>before he hurts himself

368
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,470
<6-17,Penny>例如乱穿马路之类的
<6-17,Penny>trying to cross the street something!

369
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,470
<6-18,Leonard>你干嘛不早说
<6-18,Leonard>Why didn't you say so?

370
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,800
<6-19,Penny>连这也要得到你允许吗
<6-19,Penny>Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!

371
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,540
<6-20,Leonard>我怎么知道你在想啥  佩妮
<6-20,Leonard>Well, I can't read your mind, Penny!

372
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,700
<6-21,Penny>真的吗  怎么会呢
<6-21,Penny>Really? Why not?

373
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,340
<6-21,Penny>反正你这么聪明  而我又这么蠢
<6-21,Penny>You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!

374
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,300
<7-1,Sheldon>拉杰
<7-1,Sheldon>Raj?

375
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,470
<7-1,Sheldon>拉杰

376
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,800
<7-1,Sheldon>拉杰
<7-1,Sheldon>Raj?

377
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
<7-2,Raj>别敲了  门开着
<7-2,Raj>Stop knocking! It's open!

378
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,370
<7-2,Raj>请告诉我父母  我的暗物质研究
<7-2,Raj>Please tell my parents that our Dark Matter research

379
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,640
<7-2,Raj>正在节骨眼上  我不能回家
<7-2,Raj>Is at a critical juncture, and I can't come home

380
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,840
<7-2,Raj>去参加我表弟桑杰的婚礼
<7-2,Raj>For my cousin Sanjay's wedding.

381
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,870
<7-2,Raj>谢尔顿
<7-2,Raj>Sheldon

382
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,440
<7-3,Mrs Koothrappali>问问我们儿子  我们要怎么跟切尔迪夫妇交待
<7-3,Mrs Koothrappali>Ask our son what we're supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Cheldry

383
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,270
<7-3,Mrs Koothrappali>他们的女儿拉克希米可是特地从伦敦飞回
<7-3,Mrs Koothrappali>Whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London,

384
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,390
<7-3,Mrs Koothrappali>唯一的目的  就是跟他见面相亲
<7-3,Mrs Koothrappali>For the sole purpose of meeting him.

385
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,140
<7-4,Raj>我又没让你们撮合我和拉克希米
<7-4,Raj>I didn't ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.

386
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
<7-5,Mrs Koothrappali>你该感谢我们
<7-5,Mrs Koothrappali>You should be thanking us!

<7-6,Dr Koothrappali>是的  拉克希米才刚切去了部分胃
<7-6,Dr Koothrappali>Yes.Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled.

388
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,970
<7-6,Dr Koothrappali>你有机会趁她减完肥  找回自尊之前
<7-6,Dr Koothrappali>You have an opportunity to get in good with her

389
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,100
<7-6,Dr Koothrappali>赶紧跟她搞好关系
<7-6,Dr Koothrappali>Before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.

390
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,540
<7-7,Raj>我不在乎
<7-7,Raj>I don't care!

391
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,100
<7-7,Raj>为嘛你们就不信我能自己找到另一半
<7-7,Raj>And why don't you think I can find a woman for myself?

392
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,070
<7-8,Mrs Koothrappali>因为你都27了
<7-8,Mrs Koothrappali>Because you're 27

393
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,440
<7-8,Mrs Koothrappali>你身边看着最像我们儿媳妇的
<7-8,Mrs Koothrappali>And the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law

<7-9,Raj>谢尔顿  来告诉我父母  我和霍华德只是朋友
<7-9,Raj>Sheldon,tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends.

<8-3,Penny>干嘛不干脆让我来找他
<8-3,Penny>Hey, why don't you just let me find him

404
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,570
<8-3,Penny>你就坐这儿踩着你那想象中的刹车
<8-3,Penny>While you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?

405
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,340
<8-4,Leonard>那刹车或许是我想象出来的
<8-4,Leonard>The brake might be imaginary,

406
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,500
<8-4,Leonard>但你刚刚闯的那个红灯不是
<8-4,Leonard>But that stop sign you just ran wasn't.

407
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,700
<8-5,Penny>哪个红灯

<9-1,Howard’s Mother>霍华德  去应门  我在忙
<9-1,Howard’s Mother>Howard, answer the door! I'm busy!

<9-2,Howard>我也在忙  你去应门
<9-2,Howard>I'm busy, too! You answer it.

<9-4,Howard>天哪  这种事就别告诉我了
<9-4,Howard>For God's sake, I don't need to hear that!

413
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,170
<9-4,Howard>你就不能就说一句"我在忙"吗
<9-4,Howard>Can't you just say, "I'm busy"?

414
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,640
<9-5,Howard’s Mother>我说了  但你不是还不满意吗
<9-5,Howard’s Mother>I said I'm busy,but that was't good enough for you!

415
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,870
<9-6,Howard>我真希望是有人来入室抢劫
<9-6,Howard>You know what?I hope it's one of those home invasion deals,

416
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,570
<9-6,Howard>然后照我头上  给我一枪痛快
<9-6,Howard>And they shoot me in the head!

417
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,240
<9-7,Howard’s Mother>如果真是入室抢劫的
<9-7,Howard’s Mother>Well, if it's a home invader,

<9-7,Howard’s Mother>别告诉他们我在上厕所
<9-7,Howard’s Mother>Don't tell them I'm on the toilet!

419
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,770
<9-8,Howard>根本就没人
<9-8,Howard>There's no one there.

420

427
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,470
<10-7,Penny>你指什么
<10-7,Penny>What do you mean?

428
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,070
<10-8,Stuart>谢尔顿告诉我  你跟莱纳德吵架了
<10-8,Stuart>Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?

429
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,100
<10-9,Penny>对  差不多吧
<10-9,Penny>Oh, yeah, kind of.

430

<10-9,Penny>没什么大事
<10-9,Penny>It's-It's no big thing.

431

<10-10,Stuart>我爱你
<10-10,Stuart>I love you.

433
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,700
<10-11,Leonard>你不跟我讲话  我是不会走的
<10-11,Leonard>I'm not leaving until you talk to me.

434
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,940
<10-12,Penny>怎么回事
<10-12,Penny>All right, what's going on?

435
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,470
<10-13,Leonard>这有点难解释  他这么做
<10-13,Leonard>It's a little hard to explain. He does this thing

436
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,340
<10-13,Leonard>是假装他处于一个异次元中
<10-13,Leonard>Where he pretends he's in an alternate dimension

437
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,940
<10-13,Leonard>虽然跟我们在同一物理空间
<10-13,Leonard>That occupies the same physical space we're in,

438
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,970
<10-13,Leonard>但无法感知我们
<10-13,Leonard>But he can't perceive us.

439
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,470
<10-14,Sheldon>你少臭美了  我懒得理你而已
<10-14,Sheldon>Don't flatter yourself. I'm just ignoring you.

440
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,470
<10-15,Penny>拜托  谢尔顿  回家吧
<10-15,Penny>Come on, Sheldon, let's go home.

441
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,240
<10-15,Penny>看  我们俩已经不吵了
<10-15,Penny>Look, we're done fighting.

442
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,470
<10-16,Sheldon>这话我听多了
<10-16,Sheldon>I've heard that before.

443
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,270
<10-16,Sheldon>但然后呢  接下来
<10-16,Sheldon>But then, the next thing you know,

444
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,940
<10-16,Sheldon>我躲在自己卧室  大声读着费曼(著名物理学家)的讲义
<10-16,Sheldon>I'm hiding in my bedroom,blaring a Richard Feynman lecture

445
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,470
<10-16,Sheldon>而我妈  则在吼叫着说她即使在我爸的烘肉卷里
<10-16,Sheldon>While my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her

446
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,800
<10-16,Sheldon>放上玻璃渣  上帝也会原谅她的
<10-16,Sheldon>If she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf.

447
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,640
<10-16,Sheldon>还有我爸  站在屋顶上
<10-16,Sheldon>And my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting

448
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,440
<10-16,Sheldon>用我妈的富兰克林珍藏版碗碟  玩双向飞碟射击
<10-16,Sheldon>Her Franklin Mint collectible plates.

449
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,600
<10-17,Penny>我们不会再吵嘴
<10-17,Penny>There's going to no more shouting

450
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,670
<10-17,Penny>也不会有人玩双向飞碟了
<10-17,Penny>And no skeet-shooting.

451
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,840
<10-17,Penny>真的
<10-17,Penny>Really?

452
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,770
<10-18,Sheldon>那你朋友贾斯汀要睡哪儿
<10-18,Sheldon>Where's your friend Justin going to sleep?

453
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,440
<10-19,Leonard>对啊  他要睡哪儿
<10-19,Leonard>Yeah... where's he gonna sleep?

454
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,200
<10-20,Penny>我的天  你们就不能忘了这茬吗
<10-20,Penny>Oh, my God, would you let this go?!

455
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,270
<10-21,Stuart>要是我就会
<10-21,Stuart>I'd let it go.

456
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,470
<10-21,Stuart>干嘛要我忘了这茬
<10-21,Stuart>Why should I let it go?

457
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,870
<10-22,Leonard>干嘛不去跟那人说  让他另外找地儿借宿
<10-22,Leonard>Why don't you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?!

458
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,500
<10-22,Leonard>上帝啊
<10-22,Leonard>Oh, for God's sakes.

459
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,240
<10-22,Leonard>我知道  你有童年阴影
<10-22,Leonard>So, you have childhood issues.

460
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,270
<10-22,Leonard>我们都有童年阴影
<10-22,Leonard>We all have childhood issues.

461
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,940
<10-22,Leonard>有时候  你能做的就是长大成熟  克服他们
<10-22,Leonard>At some point, you just need to grow up and get past them.

462
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
<10-22,Leonard>开火  开火
<10-22,Leonard>Fire! Fire!

463
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,200
<10-23,Penny>莱纳德  让我来处理  好吗
<10-23,Penny>Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please?

464
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,240
<10-23,Penny>-再次开火  开火  -先把这...
