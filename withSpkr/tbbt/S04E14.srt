1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,620
<2-16,Sheldon>晚上好
<2-16,Sheldon>Good evening.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,320
<5-12,Penny>我是你们的客座讲师  谢尔顿·库珀博士
<5-12,Penny>I'm your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,260
<5-12,Penny>我还等着掌声呢
<5-12,Penny>I was expecting applause,

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,170
<1-1,Sheldon>不过"王八之气"震慑后的安静也挺好的
<1-1,Sheldon>but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate.

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,030
<1-1,Sheldon>我之所以今晚愿意来给你们上课
<1-1,Sheldon>I agreed to speak to you this evening,

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,470
<1-1,Sheldon>是因为有人告诉我你们是这所学校里的
<1-1,Sheldon>because I was told that you're the best and the brightest

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,610
<1-1,Sheldon>博士生中最优秀最聪明的
<1-1,Sheldon>of this university's doctoral candidates.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,910
<1-1,Sheldon>当然  这就像是说
<1-1,Sheldon>Hmm. Of course, that's like saying

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,530
<1-1,Sheldon>你们是氢原子中最重要的电子一样
<1-1,Sheldon>you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,020
<1-1,Sheldon>因为  你们想啊
<1-1,Sheldon>'Cause, you see,

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,160
<1-1,Sheldon>氢原子只有一个电子
<1-1,Sheldon>there's only one electron in a hydrogen atom.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,170
<1-1,Sheldon>这也算最优秀最聪明啊  我的老天爷
<1-1,Sheldon>Best and brightest, my sweet patootie.

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,780
<1-1,Sheldon>好吧  开始上课
<1-1,Sheldon>All right, let's begin.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,050
<1-1,Sheldon>请举手告诉我  在座的哪位
<1-1,Sheldon>Show of hands, who here is familiar

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,240
<1-1,Sheldon>对拓扑绝缘体的概念比较熟悉
<1-1,Sheldon>with the concept of topological insulators?

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,750
<1-1,Sheldon>别自欺欺人了
<1-1,Sheldon>Don't kid yourselves.

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,470
<1-1,Sheldon>我又看到了一条谢尔顿课上的学生的微博
<1-1,Sheldon>I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon's lecture.

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,980
<2-1,Leonard>"库珀博士选择的话题相当无聊
<2-1,Leonard>"Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,970
<2-1,Leonard>并且他成功地升级到了令人无法忍受的地步
<2-1,Leonard>and managed to make it completely insufferable.

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,730
<2-1,Leonard>另外  他看起来像只大昆虫"
<2-1,Leonard>Plus, he looks like a giant insect."

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,050
<2-2,Howard>听着  听听这条
<2-2,Howard>Look. Listen to this one.

22
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,310
<2-2,Howard>"爱因斯坦的理论是不是揭示了为什么
<2-2,Howard>"Does Einstein's theory explain why time flies

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,660
<2-2,Howard>当你快乐时时间飞逝
<2-2,Howard>when you're having fun,

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,550
<2-2,Howard>而当你听库珀博士说话时
<2-2,Howard>but when you're listening to Dr. Cooper,

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,590
<2-2,Howard>时间就慢得要命"
<2-2,Howard>it falls out of the sky, dead?"

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,640
<2-3,Raj>有人拍了照
<2-3,Raj>Ooh, somebody took pictures

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,750
<2-3,Raj>还上传到了Flickr上
<2-3,Raj>and uploaded them to their Flickr account.

28
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,170
<2-4,Leonard>哇
<2-4,Leonard>Wow.

29
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,670
<2-4,Leonard>你要怎么做才能让整个演讲大厅里的人
<2-4,Leonard>How do you get an entire lecture hall

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,850
<2-4,Leonard>同时冲你竖中指啊
<2-4,Leonard>to flip you off at the same time?

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,820
<2-5,Howard>显然啊  如果你是谢尔顿的话
<2-5,Howard>Apparently, if you're Sheldon,

32
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,810
<2-5,Howard>你需要做的只是转个身而已
<2-5,Howard>all you need to do is turn your back.

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,850
<2-6,Penny>莱纳德  你家Wi-Fi坏了吗
<2-6,Penny>Hey, Leonard, is your Wi-Fi down?

34
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,770
<2-6,Penny>我连不上啊
<2-6,Penny>I can't get on.

35
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,350
<2-7,Leonard>哦  谢尔顿把密码改了
<2-7,Leonard>Oh, Sheldon changed the password.

36
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,860
<2-7,Leonard>现在是"佩妮是个蹭网的"
<2-7,Leonard>It's now "Penny is a freeloader."

37
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,340
<2-7,Leonard>别加空格
<2-7,Leonard>No spaces.

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,160
<2-8,Penny>多谢  你们在干嘛呢
<2-8,Penny>Thanks. What are you guys doing?

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,830
<2-9,Leonard>谢尔顿今晚在学校里上课
<2-9,Leonard>Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight.

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,990
<2-9,Leonard>我们在看评论
<2-9,Leonard>We're reading the reviews.

41
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,600
<2-10,Penny>他表现如何啊
<2-10,Penny>Oh. How'd he do?

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,510
<2-11,Howard>想象一下"兴登堡"号飞艇爆炸加上切尔诺贝利核泄漏
<2-11,Howard>Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl

43
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,350
<2-11,Howard>加上三里岛核泄漏再加上《电子世界争霸战2》
<2-11,Howard>meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.

44
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,470
<2-12,Penny>有那么糟啊
<2-12,Penny>That bad, huh?

45
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,190
<2-13,Leonard>念一下这个女生的微博
<2-13,Leonard>Read this woman's tweet.

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,190
<2-14,Penny>"听库珀博士讲课
<2-14,Penny>"Listening to Dr. Cooper

47
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,440
<2-14,Penny>让我又想自残了"
<2-14,Penny>has made me want to start cutting myself again""

48
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,930
<2-15,Leonard>是吧
<2-15,Leonard>Yeah.

49
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,070
<2-16,Sheldon>晚上好  莱纳德  霍华德  拉杰
<2-16,Sheldon>Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj,

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,410
<2-16,Sheldon>蹭网的
<2-16,Sheldon>freeloader.

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,710
<2-17,Howard>课上得怎么样啊
<2-17,Howard>So, how'd the lecture go?

52
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,440
<2-18,Leonard>一言以蔽之  大获全胜啊
<2-18,Leonard>In a word, triumphant.

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,510
<2-19,Leonard>真的吗  大获全胜
<2-19,Leonard>Really? Triumphant?

54
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,870
<2-20,Sheldon>可不是吗  你们真该亲眼看看那群孩子
<2-20,Sheldon>Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people.

55
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,450
<2-20,Sheldon>求知若渴  贪婪地聆听我的教诲
<2-20,Sheldon>Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom.

56
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,820
<2-20,Sheldon>我今天也许改变了不少人的人生
<2-20,Sheldon>I may have changed a few lives today.

57
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,540
<2-21,Penny>求你让我告诉他吧
<2-21,Penny>Oh, please let me tell him.

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,430
<2-22,Leonard>我不知道行不行啊  我答应了霍华德的
<2-22,Leonard>I don't know, I kind of promised Howard.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,870
<2-23,Sheldon>告诉我啥
<2-23,Sheldon>Tell me what?

60
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,580
<2-24,Howard>其实呢  我们应该一起分享这一刻
<2-24,Howard>Actually, we should all share the moment.

61
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,120
<2-24,Howard>拉杰  你来吧
<2-24,Howard>Raj, if you would.

62
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,650
<2-25,Sheldon>关于我的课的微薄啊
<2-25,Sheldon>Oh, tweets about my lecture.

63
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,960
<2-25,Sheldon>这条很不公平
<2-25,Sheldon>That's rather unfair.

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,820
<2-25,Sheldon>这条太伤人了
<2-25,Sheldon>That's downright cruel.

65
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,010
<2-25,Sheldon>而且  昆虫都有六条腿
<2-25,Sheldon>Plus, insects have six legs.

66
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,320
<2-25,Sheldon>我不是很清楚"KMN"这个缩写是啥意思
<2-25,Sheldon>Yeah, I'm not familiar with the acronym "KMN""

67
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,790
<2-26,Leonard>根据语境  我们觉得是"快杀了我吧"
<2-26,Leonard>From the context, we think it means "kill me now."

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,100
<2-27,Sheldon>我觉得每个人都有权表达自己的观点
<2-27,Sheldon>Well, I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,230
<2-27,Sheldon>我还是去睡觉吧
<2-27,Sheldon>I think I'll turn in.

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,310
<2-27,Sheldon>反正我也不想教那群榆木脑袋了
<2-27,Sheldon>I didn't want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.

71
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,920
<2-28,Howard>顺便说一句  我觉得这句话是达斯·维达
<2-28,Howard>FYI, I think that's what Darth Vader said

73
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,920
<2-28,Howard>在建造死星之前说的
<2-28,Howard>just before he started building the Death Star.

74
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,900
<2-28,Howard>生活大爆炸
<2-28,Howard>第四季第十四集

75
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,630
<3-1,Howard>谢尔顿还在郁闷吗
<3-1,Howard>Sheldon still moping?

76
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,300
<3-2,Leonard>是啊  好奇怪  就算他一开始就不想
<3-2,Leonard>Yeah, it's weird. Even though he didn't want

77
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,650
<3-2,Leonard>给这帮学生上课
<3-2,Leonard>to give the lecture in the first place,

78
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,100
<3-2,Leonard>被他们拒绝还是打击挺大的
<3-2,Leonard>being rejected by those students really hit him hard.

79
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,510
<3-3,Raj>这感觉我深有体会
<3-3,Raj>I know the feeling.

80
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,260
<3-3,Raj>就好像无意中走进了一家同性恋酒吧
<3-3,Raj>It's like accidentally walking into a gay bar

81
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,260
<3-3,Raj>然后发现没人对你有兴趣
<3-3,Raj>and then having no one hit on you.

82
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,430
<3-3,Raj>这  这是我一个朋友的经历
<3-3,Raj>It-It happened to a friend of mine.

83
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,750
<3-4,Bernadette>你们还好吗
<3-4,Bernadette>Are you guys doing okay?

84
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,070
<3-5,Howard>莱纳德和我还好
<3-5,Howard>Leonard and I are fine,

85
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,130
<3-5,Howard>但我觉得拉杰现在真的急需一位小妞
<3-5,Howard>but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.

86
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,290
<3-6,Bernadette>这不是什么难事
<3-6,Bernadette>Well, that shouldn't be too hard.

87
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,730
<3-6,Bernadette>他这么可爱
<3-6,Bernadette>He's such a cutie.

88
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,480
<3-7,Raj>谢谢夸奖  但是"可爱"是形容小兔子的
<3-7,Raj>Thank you, but "cute" is for bunnies.

89
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,270
<3-7,Raj>我想要能吸引异性
<3-7,Raj>I want to be something with sex appeal,

90
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,120
<3-7,Raj>就像  就像拉布拉多犬一样
<3-7,Raj>like... like a labradoodle.

91
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,370
<3-8,Howard>拉布拉多犬
<3-8,Howard>Labradoodle?

92
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,460
<3-9,Leonard>我们估计得从头考虑你的问题了
<3-9,Leonard>We might be starting to zero in on your problem.

93
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,920
<3-10,Bernadette>别听他们的
<3-10,Bernadette>Don't you listen to them.

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,780
<3-10,Bernadette>你对异性有足够的吸引力
<3-10,Bernadette>You've got plenty of sex appeal.

95
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,790
<3-11,Raj>你真这么觉得吗
<3-11,Raj>You really think so?

96
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,830
<3-12,Bernadette>是啊  你好性感哦
<3-12,Bernadette>Yeah. You're a hottie.

97
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,340
<3-13,Raj>谢谢  伯纳黛特
<3-13,Raj>Well, thanks, Bernadette.

98
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,760
<3-13,Raj>顺便告诉你们
<3-13,Raj>And just for the record,

99
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,250
<3-13,Raj>拉布拉多犬是防过敏的
<3-13,Raj>labradoodles are hypo-allergenic,

100
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,190
<3-13,Raj>这对于那些深受动物毛屑困扰的人来说很性感
<3-13,Raj>which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.

101
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,340
<4-1,Amy (on webcam, with an undersea background)>你觉得怎么样
<4-1,Amy (on webcam, with an undersea background)>So, what do you think?

102
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,150
<4-2,Sheldon>很炫的视觉效果  但是我还是不高兴
<4-2,Sheldon>It's a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.

103
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,010
<4-3,Amy>就算我这么做都没用吗
<4-3,Amy>Not even when I do this?

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,230
<4-4,Sheldon>没用
<4-4,Sheldon>No.

105
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,020
<4-5,Amy>这是我搞怪的压箱底招了
<4-5,Amy>Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.

106
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,250
<4-6,Sheldon>你知不知道  教书是我自从1989年3月
<4-6,Sheldon>Do you realize that teaching is the first thing

107
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,420
<4-6,Sheldon>做引体向上失败以后
<4-6,Sheldon>I've failed at since my ill-fated attempt

108
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,520
<4-6,Sheldon>搞砸的第一件事
<4-6,Sheldon>to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,540
<4-7,Amy>如果这次丢人的经历
<4-7,Amy>If this humiliating experience

110
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,720
<4-7,Amy>真的让你很困扰的话
<4-7,Amy>is really troubling you,

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,580
<4-7,Amy>我们还是有办法解决的
<4-7,Amy>there are things we could do about it.

112
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,110
<4-8,Sheldon>比如
<4-8,Sheldon>For instance?

113
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,680
<4-9,Amy>首先想到的
<4-9,Amy>Well, the first thing that comes to mind

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,060
<4-9,Amy>就是隔离你大脑里
<4-9,Amy>is isolating the part of your brain

115
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,220
<4-9,Amy>负责存储记忆的部分  然后用激光切掉它
<4-9,Amy>where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,440
<4-10,Sheldon>嗯  不行
<4-10,Sheldon>Hmm, no.

117
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,510
<4-10,Sheldon>你一不留神
<4-10,Sheldon>One slip of the hand,

118
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,640
<4-10,Sheldon>我就只能坐在工程学院里
<4-10,Sheldon>and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering Department,

119
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,250
<4-10,Sheldon>和沃罗威茨一起捣鼓些小玩意儿了
<4-10,Sheldon>building doodads with Wolowitz.

120
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,360
<4-10,Sheldon>好吧
<4-10,Sheldon>All right.

121
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,770
<4-11,Amy>你有没有考虑过提高你的社交技能呢
<4-11,Amy>Have you considered improving your socialization skills,

122
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,430
<4-11,Amy>好让你
<4-11,Amy>thus allowing you

123
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,630
<4-11,Amy>更有效地和别人交流
<4-11,Amy>to communicate more effectively with other people?

124
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,010
<4-12,Sheldon>这难道不是他们的负担吗
<4-12,Sheldon>Isn't that their burden?

125
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,530
<4-12,Sheldon>我一直都是瞩目的焦点
<4-12,Sheldon>I'm the one with something interesting to say.

126
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,370
<4-13,Amy>没错  但是从本质上来讲
<4-13,Amy>Fair enough, but in its essence,

127
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,150
<4-13,Amy>教书是一门表演艺术
<4-13,Amy>teaching is a performance art.

128
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,530
<4-13,Amy>在教室这一范例中
<4-13,Amy>In the classroom paradigm,

129
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,880
<4-13,Amy>教师有交流的责任
<4-13,Amy>the teacher has the responsibility to communicate,

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,780
<4-13,Amy>也有娱乐和吸引学生的责任
<4-13,Amy>as well as entertain and engage.

131
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,380
<4-14,Sheldon>我感觉你在循循善诱啊
<4-14,Sheldon>I sense that you're trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany.

132
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,710
<4-14,Sheldon>你为何不直奔主题呢
<4-14,Sheldon>Would you mind very much jumping to it?

133
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,340
<4-15,Amy>也许你该考虑一下学学表演
<4-15,Amy>Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.

134
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,190
<4-15,Amy>学表演
<4-15,Amy>Acting lessons.

135
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,070
<4-15,Amy>有意思
<4-15,Amy>Interesting.

136
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,290
<4-16,Sheldon>如果我能表现得好像我关心我的学生们
<4-16,Sheldon>It might help if I could act as though I care

137
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,190
<4-16,Sheldon>在意他们学没学会  没准儿还有点儿用
<4-16,Sheldon>about my students and whether or not they learn.

138
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,400
<5-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<5-1,Sheldon>Penny.

139
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,130
<5-1,Sheldon>佩妮  佩妮
<5-1,Sheldon>Penny. Penny.

140
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,730
<5-2,Penny>干嘛
<5-2,Penny>What?

141
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,540
<5-3,Sheldon>你是个"演员"  对吧
<5-3,Sheldon>You're an "actress," correct?

142
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,920
<5-4,Penny>我不是"演员"
<5-4,Penny>I'm not an "actress."

143
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,740
<5-4,Penny>我就是演员
<5-4,Penny>I'm an actress.

144
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,830
<5-4,Penny>好吧
<5-4,Penny>All right.

145
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,780
<5-4,Penny>你是个演员
<5-4,Penny>You're an actress.

146
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,850
<5-5,Sheldon>我需要你教教我
<5-5,Sheldon>I need you to teach me.

147
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,150
<5-6,Penny>你想上一节表演课
<5-6,Penny>You want an acting lesson?

148
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,300
<5-7,Sheldon>没准儿得两节  我想学精一点儿
<5-7,Sheldon>Perhaps two. I'd like to master the craft.

149
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,640
<5-8,Penny>你怎么忽然想到这个的
<5-8,Penny>Okay, where is this coming from?

150
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,800
<5-9,Sheldon>有人建议我说  表演技巧
<5-9,Sheldon>It has been suggested to me that acting techniques

151
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,920
<5-9,Sheldon>能够提高我的教学水平
<5-9,Sheldon>could improve my lecturing, at which,

152
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,280
<5-9,Sheldon>如果有人相信那些微博和博客的话
<5-9,Sheldon>if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed,

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,780
<5-9,Sheldon>我貌似"不很擅长教学"
<5-9,Sheldon>I "suck the big one."

154
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,950
<5-10,Penny>啊  我都看过了  写得很好玩
<5-10,Penny>Yeah, I saw those. They were funny.

155
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,500
<5-10,Penny>我还打印了一些出来  贴在冰箱上了
<5-10,Penny>I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.

156
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,030
<5-11,Sheldon>那咱们什么时候开始上课
<5-11,Sheldon>So, when could we start?

157
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,430
<5-12,Penny>好吧  先把话说清楚了
<5-12,Penny>Okay, just to be clear.

158
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,100
<5-12,Penny>你找我帮忙是因为我会一些
<5-12,Penny>You are asking me for help because I know something

159
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,190
<5-12,Penny>你这位聪慧的谢尔顿·库珀博士不会的东西
<5-12,Penny>that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.

160
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,490
<5-13,Sheldon>你这样解释也行
<5-13,Sheldon>I suppose that's one way to look at it.

161
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,590
<5-14,Penny>我认为这是唯一的解释了
<5-14,Penny>I think it's the only way to look at it.

162
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,340
<5-15,Sheldon>你到底帮不帮我嘛
<5-15,Sheldon>Are you going to help me or not?

163
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,630
<5-16,Penny>考虑看看  我只是比较享受这段前戏
<5-16,Penny>Probably. I'm just enjoying the foreplay.

164
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,520
<5-16,Penny>这是不是就意味着你不会再嘲笑我的演艺事业了
<5-16,Penny>Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?

165
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,120
<5-17,Sheldon>真不好意思  我以为你由演员
<5-17,Sheldon>Oh, I'm sorry, I thought making the transition

166
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,040
<5-17,Sheldon>转变为表演课老师
<5-17,Sheldon>from actor to acting teacher

167
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,460
<5-17,Sheldon>就已经意味着
<5-17,Sheldon>was the signal that one's career

168
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,700
<5-17,Sheldon>你的事业走到了尽头了
<5-17,Sheldon>had reached the end of the road.

169
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,330
<5-18,Penny>算了吧
<5-18,Penny>Forget it.

170
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,210
<5-19,Sheldon>我付你四十美金
<5-19,Sheldon>I'll pay you $40.

<6-1,Howard>拉杰  我有好消息要宣布
<6-1,Howard>Raj, I have amazing news!

173

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,040
<6-3,Howard>以色列的魏茨曼研究所刚刚通知我
<6-3,Howard>I just got offered a fellowship

175
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,210
<6-3,Howard>他们给我提供了学术奖学金邀我过去
<6-3,Howard>at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.

<6-4,Raj>-伙计  这太棒了  -就是
<6-4,Raj>- Dude, that's incredible!  - I know.

177
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,140
<6-5,Howard>唯一的问题是  我得离开两年
<6-5,Howard>The only thing is, I'm gonna be gone for two years.

178
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,940
<6-6,Raj>我会想你的
<6-6,Raj>Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

179

<6-6,Raj>你跟他一起去吗
<6-6,Raj>Are you going with him?

180
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,530
<6-7,Bernadette>我得留在这上学
<6-7,Bernadette>I have to stay here for school.

181
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,670
<6-8,Howard>我们就是来找你谈这件事的
<6-8,Howard>That's what we're here to talk to you about.

182
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,100
<6-8,Howard>你知道  伯纳黛特也是有需求的
<6-8,Howard>You see, Bernadette has needs.

183
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,560
<6-9,Raj>什么需求
<6-9,Raj>What kind of needs?

184
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,380
<6-10,Howard>性需求
<6-10,Howard>Sexual needs.

185
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,570
<6-11,Bernadette>大部分都还比较正常
<6-11,Bernadette>Most of them regular,

186
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,020
<6-11,Bernadette>但也有些比较狂野的
<6-11,Bernadette>some of them kind of messed up.

187
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,740
<6-12,Howard>所以  我不在的时候
<6-12,Howard>So, while I'm gone,

188
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,670
<6-12,Howard>就得靠你来满足她了
<6-12,Howard>you're going to have to satisfy her.

189
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,320
<6-13,Bernadette>你同意吗
<6-13,Bernadette>What do you say?

190
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,530
<6-14,Raj>乐意之至
<6-14,Raj>I say okey-dokey.

191
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,410
<6-15,Howard (to the real Raj who is daydreaming)>你这么认真地想什么呢
<6-15,Howard (to the real Raj who is daydreaming)>What ya thinking so hard about?

192
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,340
<6-16,Raj>我只是在想我绝对不是同性恋
<6-16,Raj>Just that I'm definitely not gay.

193
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,580
<6-16,Raj>佩妮
<6-16,Raj>Penny!

194
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,780
<7-1,Sheldon>佩妮  佩妮

195
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,370
<7-2,Penny>出什么事了
<7-2,Penny>What's wrong?

196
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,540
<7-3,Sheldon>没事  我在演戏而已
<7-3,Sheldon>Nothing. I was acting.

197
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,700
<7-4,Penny>你在演戏
<7-4,Penny>You were acting.

198
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,110
<7-5,Sheldon>没错  我为了今天要上的课做了很多预习
<7-5,Sheldon>Yes. In preparation for today's studies,

199
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,610
<7-5,Sheldon>我读了斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的《演员的准备》
<7-5,Sheldon>I read Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares,

201
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,510
<7-3,Sheldon>斯特拉·阿德勒的《演戏的技术》

<7-5,Sheldon>和亨利·温克勒的《欸, 我是演员》
<7-5,Sheldon>and Henry Winkler's Ayyy, I'm an Actor.

204
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,470
<7-6,Penny>真不错
<7-6,Penny>Well, good for you.

205
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,810
<7-6,Penny>进来吧
<7-6,Penny>Come on in.

206
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,660
<7-7,Sheldon>我们怎么开始
<7-7,Sheldon>How shall we begin?

207
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,050
<7-8,Penny>我认为我们可以
<7-8,Penny>Well, I thought we'd start

208
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,570
<7-8,Penny>先做一些基础的动作练习
<7-8,Penny>with some basic movement exercises.

209
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,440
<7-8,Penny>就是稍微热热身
<7-8,Penny>You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.

210
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,300
<7-9,Sheldon>好吧
<7-9,Sheldon>All right.

211
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,590
<7-10,Penny>我想让你放松
<7-10,Penny>So I just want you to relax

212
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,750
<7-10,Penny>随意的扭动一下身体
<7-10,Penny>and kind of move around in the space.

213
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,820
<7-10,Penny>你觉得怎么自然就怎么来
<7-10,Penny>You know, just do whatever feels natural.

214
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,420
<7-10,Penny>谢尔顿
<7-10,Penny>Sheldon?

215
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,270
<7-11,Sheldon (doing nothing)>你说让我觉得怎么自然就怎么来
<7-11,Sheldon (doing nothing)>You said to do whatever feels natural.

216
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,130
<7-11,Sheldon (doing nothing)>我这样就挺自然的
<7-11,Sheldon (doing nothing)>This feels natural.

217
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,590
<7-11,Sheldon (doing nothing)>肯定比你在做的那些动作
<7-11,Sheldon (doing nothing)>Certainly more natural

218
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,000
<7-11,Sheldon (doing nothing)>要自然得多
<7-11,Sheldon (doing nothing)>than what you're doing.

219
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,760
<7-12,Penny>拜托  你得配合我
<7-12,Penny>Come on, you got to work with me.

220
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,900
<7-12,Penny>我们要跟我们的身体建立联系
<7-12,Penny>We need to get connected with our bodies.

221
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,480
<7-13,Sheldon>佩妮  我和我的身体
<7-13,Sheldon>Penny, my body and I have a relationship

222
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,690
<7-13,Sheldon>在双方都很酷并且保持一定距离的情况下
<7-13,Sheldon>that works best when we maintain a cool,

223
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,910
<7-13,Sheldon>才能运作的最好
<7-13,Sheldon>wary distance from each other.

224
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,130
<7-14,Penny>好吧  就当咱们已经热过身了吧
<7-14,Penny>All right, let's just say we've warmed up.

225
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,650
<7-15,Sheldon>你是"老师"  你说了算
<7-15,Sheldon>You're the "teacher" .

226
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,700
<7-16,Penny>好吧  你要是想跟你的学生
<7-16,Penny>Okay. One of the things that might help you

227
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,090
<7-16,Penny>建立沟通  其中一个有效的办法
<7-16,Penny>in connecting with your students

228
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,350
<7-16,Penny>就是要自然一些
<7-16,Penny>is being a little more spontaneous.

229
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,100
<7-16,Penny>所以咱们试试即兴表演怎么样
<7-16,Penny>So why don't we try some improvisation?

230
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,240
<7-17,Sheldon>当然好啦  反正
<7-17,Sheldon>Why not? It seems like

231
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,770
<7-17,Sheldon>你整个教学过程也都是在即兴表演
<7-17,Sheldon>you're improvising your entire curriculum.

232
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,690
<7-18,Penny>这主要练习的就是倾听和反应能力
<7-18,Penny>This is all about listening and responding.

233
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,350
<7-19,Sheldon>明白
<7-19,Sheldon>Gotcha.

234
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,460
<7-20,Penny>我要创造一个角色
<7-20,Penny>I'm going to create a character

235
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,570
<7-20,Penny>和一个场景  你准备好了就加入我的表演
<7-20,Penny>and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.

236
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,050
<7-22,Penny>-好的  -那开始了
<7-22,Penny>- All right.  - All right.

237
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,560
<7-23,Sheldon>开拍
<7-23,Sheldon>Action.

238
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,810
<7-24,Penny>好吧  这不是在演电影
<7-24,Penny>Okay, it's not a movie.

239
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,900
<7-24,Penny>这只是即兴表演  所以用不着叫"开拍"
<7-24,Penny>It's improv. So no one calls "action" .

240

253
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,210
<7-30,Penny>还好我们又卖鞋又卖酸奶
<7-30,Penny>Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,170
<7-31,Sheldon>是吗

<7-32,Penny>Yes. Look up at the sign,

256
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,640
<7-32,Penny>你还要记着  即兴表演就是要说是
<7-32,Penny>and remember, improv is always about saying yes.

257
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,290
<7-32,Penny>好吧
<7-32,Penny>All right.

258

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,330
<7-33,Sheldon>我看到招牌了
<7-33,Sheldon>I see a sign.

260
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,500
<7-33,Sheldon>上面写着"卡马里奥州精神病院"
<7-33,Sheldon>It says "Camarillo State Mental Hospital" .

261
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,210
<7-34,Penny>什么
<7-34,Penny>What?

262
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,330
<7-35,Sheldon>只有这个理由才能解释
<7-35,Sheldon>It's the only explanation I can come up with

263
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,690
<7-35,Sheldon>你怎么会认为自己又卖鞋又卖酸奶
<7-35,Sheldon>for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.

264
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,510
<7-36,Penny>好吧  这样好了
<7-36,Penny>Okay, you know what?

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,290
<7-36,Penny>住在高速公路天桥下的酒鬼好了
<7-36,Penny>living under a freeway overpass.

276
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,620
<8-1,Leonard>我还是不明白
<8-1,Leonard>I'm still not adjusted

277
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,600
<8-1,Leonard>幻想频道怎么会是这样拼写
<8-1,Leonard>to how the SyFy channel spells their name now.

279
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,130
<8-2,Raj>S-y-F-y  那就成"饭想"了

<8-5,Leonard>Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck.

00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
<8-5,Leonard>他现在情况危殆
<8-5,Leonard>He's in critical condition.

<8-8,Leonard>Have you seen him?

290
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,970
<8-9,Bernadette>他们不让我进去

<8-15,Raj>不  不  不  别这么说
<8-15,Raj>No, no, no, don't say that.

302
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,950
<8-15,Raj>你会没事的
<8-15,Raj>You're going to be all right.

<8-16,Howard>拉杰  我时间不多了  好好听我说
<8-16,Howard>Raj, I don't have time. Now, pay attention.

304
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,360
<8-16,Howard>我最后的愿望就是你要好好照顾伯纳黛特
<8-16,Howard>My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,770
<8-17,Raj>当然了  当然了
<8-17,Raj>Of course, of course.

306
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,120
<8-17,Raj>不过你说"照顾"是指
<8-17,Raj>Now when you say "look after", you mean...

307
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,040
<8-18,Bernadette>性方面的
<8-18,Bernadette>Sexually.

308
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,890
<8-19,Raj>对不起  伯纳黛特  我得听他亲口说出来
<8-19,Raj>Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.

309
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,010
<8-18,Bernadette>性需求
<8-18,Bernadette>Sexually.

310
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,310
<8-21,Raj>哦了  保重啦
<8-21,Raj>Got it. Take care.

311
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,940
<8-21,Raj>我别无选择
<8-21,Raj>I guess I have no choice

312
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,740
<8-21,Raj>只能在余生  一而再再而三
<8-21,Raj>but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you

313
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,990
<8-21,Raj>毫无罪恶地跟你享受甜蜜爱欲
<8-21,Raj>over and over again for the rest of my life.

314
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,810
<8-22,Bernadette>这也是我亲耳所闻的
<8-22,Bernadette>That's how I heard it.

315
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,270
<8-23,Leonard (out of Raj’s daydream)>又或者可以取名为"幻仙"
<8-23,Leonard (out of Raj’s daydream)>Or it could be "sy-fee."

316
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,680
<8-24,Raj>你说什么
<8-24,Raj>What?

317
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,430
<8-25,Leonard>S-y-F-y. "幻仙"
<8-25,Leonard>S-y-F-y. "Sy-fee."

318
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,050
<8-26,Raj>好吧
<8-26,Raj>Oh, right.

319
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,580
<8-26,Raj>给力
<8-26,Raj>Good one.

320
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,440
<9-1,Penny>对了  你有时间看一遍我给你的那部电影吗
<9-1,Penny>So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?

321
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,880
<9-2,Sheldon>看了  但是我不喜欢
<9-2,Sheldon>Yes. I didn't care for it.

322
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,430
<9-3,Penny>《朱门巧妇》可是美国经典中的经典
<9-3,Penny>Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.

324
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,870
<9-4,Sheldon>传奇汉堡也是
<9-4,Sheldon>So is the McRib sandwich.

325
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,490
<9-4,Sheldon>可我照样也不喜欢它
<9-4,Sheldon>I don't care for that, either.

326
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,500
<9-5,Penny>好吧  那在场景学习方面  你到底想怎么做
<9-5,Penny>Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?

327
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,960
<9-6,Sheldon>很高兴你能这么问
<9-6,Sheldon>I'm glad you asked.

328
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,330
<9-6,Sheldon>我擅自把我
<9-6,Sheldon>I took the liberty

329
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,340
<9-6,Sheldon>十岁那年写的《星际迷航》同人小说
<9-6,Sheldon>of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella

330
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,010
<9-6,Sheldon>改编成一部独幕剧
<9-6,Sheldon>I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.

331
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,850
<9-7,Penny>而你觉得比田纳西·威廉姆斯写的强多了
<9-7,Penny>And you think it's better than Tennessee Williams?

333
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,250
<9-8,Sheldon>为什么不留给后代去决定呢
<9-8,Sheldon>Why don't we leave that for future generations to decide?

334
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,930
<9-9,Penny>《那些谢尔顿未曾到过的地方》
<9-9,Penny>Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.

335
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,960
<9-10,Sheldon>这个故事是发生在东德克萨斯州
<9-10,Sheldon>It's the story of a young boy who is transported

336
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,550
<9-10,Sheldon>在愚昧无知的边远地区  一个少年郎
<9-10,Sheldon>from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas

337
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,120
<9-10,Sheldon>被送到二十三世纪
<9-10,Sheldon>to the 23rd Century,

338
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,720
<9-10,Sheldon>在那里  他的聪明才智不仅为人赏识  而且被人盛赞
<9-10,Sheldon>where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.

339
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,600
<9-11,Penny>杀了我吧
<9-11,Penny>KMN...

340
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,520
<9-12,Sheldon>现在  在这场关键的戏里
<9-12,Sheldon>Now, in this pivotal scene,

341
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,170
<9-12,Sheldon>你扮演的谢尔顿的母亲  与星际联邦的特使
<9-12,Sheldon>Sheldon's mother, played by you, argues with an emissary

342
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,240
<9-12,Sheldon>斯波克先生发生争吵  而斯波克先生
<9-12,Sheldon>of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock,

343
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,470
<9-12,Sheldon>则由我来生动的展现
<9-12,Sheldon>the role I will bring to life.

344
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,740
<9-13,Penny>好吧  这样也行  但咱们先试试
<9-13,Penny>Okay, that's fine, but let's try

345
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,710
<9-13,Penny>让你脱离你的舒适区
<9-13,Penny>and get you out of your comfort zone.

346
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,390
<9-14,Sheldon>为什么咱们要这么做
<9-14,Sheldon>Why would we want to do that?

347
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,670
<9-14,Sheldon>"舒适区"之所以这么叫  是有原因的
<9-14,Sheldon>It's called "the comfort zone" for a reason.

348
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,660
<9-15,Penny>这么做的原因是让你放松点儿
<9-15,Penny>Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little,

349
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,070
<9-15,Penny>所以我觉得你应该扮演母亲的角色
<9-15,Penny>so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother,

350
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,420
<9-15,Penny>而我负责来生动展现斯波克先生
<9-15,Penny>and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.

351
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,340
<9-16,Sheldon>我没听错吧
<9-16,Sheldon>I'm sorry.

352
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,060
<9-16,Sheldon>由你来演斯波克
<9-16,Sheldon>You'll be Spock?

353
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,460
<9-17,Penny>这才符合逻辑[Spock 台词]
<9-17,Penny>It's only logical.

354
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,830
<9-18,Sheldon>很好
<9-18,Sheldon>Very well.

355
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,380
<9-18,Sheldon>我来叙述一下背景
<9-18,Sheldon>I'll set the scene.

356
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,640
<9-19,Penny>好的
<9-19,Penny>All right.

357
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,520
<9-19,Penny>东德克萨斯州
<9-19,Penny>"East Texas.

358
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,510

<9-20,Sheldon>"A warm summer night.

359

360
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,800

<9-33,Penny>Okay, okay, let's try that last line again,

399
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,790
<9-33,Penny>这次你可以试着稍微带点哽咽
