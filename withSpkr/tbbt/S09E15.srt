<1-10,Leonard>你听起来不是太期待啊
<1-10,Leonard>You don't sound very excited about it.

14

<1-11,Raj>没有啊  我挺期待吧
<1-11,Raj>Oh, I am, I am. I g... I guess

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,190
<1-11,Raj>可能我还不确定我跟艾米丽到底适不适合
<1-11,Raj>I'm still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,000
<1-12,Howard>这不会跟喝咖啡的那个女生有关吧
<1-12,Howard>Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,130
<1-13,Raj>你是说那位我魂萦梦牵的身心灵完美女神吗

<1-13,Raj>Who can say?

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,200
<1-14,Howard>你念叨着要跟艾米丽分手多久了
<1-14,Howard>You've been talking about breaking up with Emily forever.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,660
<1-14,Howard>你为什么不赶紧分了得了
<1-14,Howard>Why don't you just do it already?

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,670
<1-15,Leonard>早死早超生
<1-15,Leonard>Yeah, just get it over with.

22
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,300
<1-16,Raj>你们说得好像很简单
<1-16,Raj>Well, you say it like it's easy.

23
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,780
<1-16,Raj>你们之中有任何人跟别人分手过吗
<1-16,Raj>Have any one of youever broken up with anyone?

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
<1-18,Leonard>-没  -不太
<1-18,Leonard>- No. - Not really.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,540
<1-19,Sheldon>有一次我不小心叫了车
<1-19,Sheldon>You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident.

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,340
<1-19,Sheldon>我只能默默上车  随便去了个地方
<1-19,Sheldon>I just got in and went somewhere.

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,030
<2-1,Penny>你真的要跟她分手吗
<2-1,Penny>So, you really gonna break up with her?

38
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,720
<2-2,Raj>我想是的

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,090
<2-2,Raj>有任何建议吗
<2-2,Raj>Do you have any advice?

40
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,840
<2-3,Penny>我这一生甩过无数男子
<2-3,Penny>Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys.

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,550
<2-3,Penny>你知道我甩过莱纳德几次吗
<2-3,Penny>I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?

42
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,950
<2-4,Leonard>第四次之后我就不数了
<2-4,Leonard>I stopped counting at four.

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,010
<2-5,Penny>我给你的建议就是去她家提分手
<2-5,Penny>All right, my advice to you is do it at her place

44
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,420
<2-5,Penny>这样你需要走人时就随时能走
<2-5,Penny>so you can leave when you need to,

45
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,010
<2-5,Penny>实话实说  快刀斩乱麻
<2-5,Penny>uh, tell the truth, make it quick

46
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,110
<2-5,Penny>做好会有人喷泪的准备
<2-5,Penny>and be prepared for tears.

47
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,250
<2-6,Raj>我已经打算在进她家前先预哭一场
<2-6,Raj>Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there.

48
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,770
<2-6,Raj>先把我的眼泪哭干
<2-6,Raj>Really dry myself out.

49
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,310
<2-7,Leonard>她指的是艾米丽
<2-7,Leonard>She meant Emily.

50
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,770
<2-8,Penny>没  真的不是指她
<2-8,Penny>No, I-I really didn't.

51
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,730
<3-1,Emily>你真的要跟我分手吗
<3-1,Emily>You're seriously breaking up with me?

52
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,390
<3-2,Raj>是的
<3-2,Raj>Yeah.

53
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,110
<3-3,Emily>然后你觉得在情人节前提分手
<3-3,Emily>And you thought right before Valentine's Day

54
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,210
<3-3,Emily>是好时机吗
<3-3,Emily>was a good time to do it?

55
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,240
<3-4,Raj>有道理  那我们几天后再谈吧
<3-4,Raj>You're right-- let's talk again in a few days.

<4-1,Raj (on phone)>I was-I was wondering if you're free for Valentine's Day?

58

<4-4,Claire>求你别不要我  我们的爱是天作之合
<4-4,Claire>Please take me back. Our love was meant to be!

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,650
<4-4,Claire>我情人节要当单身狗了
<4-4,Claire>I'm gonna all alone on Valentine's Day.

64

155
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,680
<10-13,Amy>我觉得是始于良好的沟通
<10-13,Amy>I-I think it starts with good communication.

<10-14,Sheldon>是啊  等等  这问题跟旗帜无关
<10-14,Sheldon>Yeah, wait, that's not a flag question.

<11-3,Howard>那该把它扔回去多泡几分钟吗
<11-3,Howard>Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?

<11-7,Howard>Well, it was just in a hot tub. I'm gonna say "Check."

174
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,360
<11-8,Bernadette>还有别的吗
<11-8,Bernadette>Anything else?

175
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,960
<11-9,Howard>确保它没有脱水
<11-9,Howard>To make sure it's not dehydrated,

176
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,180
<11-9,Howard>喂他一勺电解质溶液
<11-9,Howard>feed him an electrolyte solution.

177
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,230
<11-9,Howard>如果没有反应
<11-9,Howard>If it's not responding,

178
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,070
<11-9,Howard>用一块暖布帮他擦洗脸和生殖器
<11-9,Howard>use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals.

<12-4,Leonard>我不知道我是否能接受这事
<12-4,Leonard>I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

205
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,630
<13-1,Amy>拉杰什  分手后
<13-1,Amy>Rajesh, it's perfectly normal

206
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,240
<13-1,Amy>产生自我怀疑非常正常
<13-1,Amy>to have doubts after breaking up with someone.

207
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,780
<13-2,Raj (voice)>你真的这么认为吗

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,380
<13-3,Sheldon>在一个旗帜节目里哭诉个人情绪
<13-3,Sheldon>Blubbering about emotions during a flag show.

210
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,880
<13-3,Sheldon>除非那种情绪是因为新西兰要变更国旗
<13-3,Sheldon>Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand

211
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,010
<13-3,Sheldon>喜极而泣
<13-3,Sheldon>changing their flag.

212
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,530
<13-3,Sheldon>祝你们好运哦  疯狂的新西兰人

<13-4,Amy>你的朋友正在伤心呢
<13-4,Amy>Your friend is hurting.

215
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,920
<13-5,Raj>不  谢尔顿说得对
<13-5,Raj>No, Sheldon's right.

216
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,940
<13-5,Raj>艾丽米说过我老对自己的感受喋喋不休
<13-5,Raj>Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.

217
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,090
<13-6,Sheldon>我想
<13-6,Sheldon>I-I suppose that

218
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,450
<13-6,Sheldon>这应该算是恋爱中需要注意的一点
<13-6,Sheldon>could be a legitimate concern in a relationship.

219
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,960
<13-6,Sheldon>甚至可以算作恋爱路上的危险红旗
<13-6,Sheldon>Uh, perhaps even a-a red flag.

220
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,130
<13-6,Sheldon>说到红旗
<13-6,Sheldon>And speaking of red flags,

<15-15,Leonard>也许不会  但等我们真正老去的那天
<15-15,Leonard>Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old,

<15-16,Penny>比如什么
<15-16,Penny>Okay, like what?

281
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,370
<15-17,Leonard>我想到了  食物大战

<16-1,Amy>我知道你俩为单身而难过
<16-1,Amy>Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone,

284
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,530
<16-1,Amy>但有时最好的解决办法
<16-1,Amy>but sometimes the best thing you can do

285
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,050
<16-1,Amy>就是给自己一点时间
<16-1,Amy>is take a little time for yourself,

287
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,070
<16-2,Sheldon>说到结束关系
<16-2,Sheldon>Speaking of ending relationships,

288

<16-2,Sheldon>and I would like to hang myself from that tree.

293
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,570
<16-4,Amy>我不觉得那算是立刻
<16-4,Amy>Well, I... I wouldn't say right away.

<19-1,Raj (voice)>没有想到  会如此心痛
<19-1,Raj (voice)>I just... I didn't realize it was gonna hurt this much.

361
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,040
<19-3,Sheldon>这一点都不有趣
<19-3,Sheldon>Nothing about this is fun.

362
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,630
<19-3,Sheldon>没人想聊旗帜
<19-3,Sheldon>No one wants to talk about flags,

363
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,170
<19-3,Sheldon>而我已经十分钟插不上话了

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,130
<19-5,Amy>你这样非常没有同情心
<19-5,Amy>You know, you're not being very sympathetic.

<19-5,Amy>分手的痛楚你最清楚不过了

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,080
<19-6,Sheldon>尽管如此  这种痛苦有进化的作用
<19-6,Sheldon>However, pain has an evolutionary purpose.

375
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,470
<19-6,Sheldon>这让我们获得外部提供的信息
<19-6,Sheldon>It provides information from the environment

376
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,560
<19-6,Sheldon>这种行为对我们有负面影响
<19-6,Sheldon>that, uh, behavior isn't good for us.

377
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,400
<19-7,Barry>比如我爱上了那个脱衣舞女
<19-7,Barry>Like when I fell in love with that stripper

<19-9,Sheldon>当初我和艾米分手时  我也很痛苦
<19-9,Sheldon>When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered.

382
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,490
<19-9,Sheldon>说起来也许你不信
<19-9,Sheldon>And this may sound surprising,

383
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,060
<19-9,Sheldon>但我很感激有过这段磨难

<19-13,Sheldon>在我们分手期间
<19-13,Sheldon>When-when we were apart,

<20-6,Amy>有意思  但哪时会需要用单数表示
<20-6,Amy>Interesting, and when would you use the singular?
