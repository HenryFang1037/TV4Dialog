2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,580
<1-1,Howard>这游戏怎么玩
<1-1,Howard>So how does this game work?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,190
<1-1,Howard>就像手里真的有球那样扔出去吗
<1-1,Howard>I just throw out like a real ball?

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,310
<1-2,Leonard>没错  就放轻松  往本垒投去
<1-2,Leonard>Yep. Just nice and easy, right over the plate.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,650
<1-3,Howard>好的
<1-3,Howard>All right.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,070
<1-4,Raj>你个废物  沃罗威茨
<1-4,Raj>You suck, Wolowitz!

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,580
<1-5,Howard>你什么意思
<1-5,Howard>What's that about?

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,540
<1-6,Raj>起哄闹你啊
<1-6,Raj>I'm heckling you.

9
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,550
<1-6,Raj>这是棒球中很有爱的一部分
<1-6,Raj>It's a beloved part of baseball.

10
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,180
<1-6,Raj>他说得对
<1-6,Raj>He's right.

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,650
<1-7,Sheldon>而且估计你现在还在等着
<1-7,Sheldon>And given that you're probably still waiting

12
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,540
<1-7,Sheldon>被选进你五年级时那场球赛的队伍
<1-7,Sheldon>to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade,

13
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,370
<1-7,Sheldon>我敢肯定你绝对废
<1-7,Sheldon>I'm sure you do suck.

14
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,520
<1-8,Penny>大家好  在干嘛啊
<1-8,Penny>Hi. What's going on?

<1-9,Leonard>Baseball.

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,810
<1-10,Penny>我叫你们出去玩  指的可不是这样
<1-10,Penny>Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.

17
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,510
<1-11,Leonard>他在练习
<1-11,Leonard>He's practicing.

18
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,590
<1-12,Penny>练来干嘛
<1-12,Penny>For what?

19
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,350
<1-13,Howard>天使队想找一个宇航员来当开球嘉宾
<1-13,Howard>The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch,

21
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,150
<1-13,Howard>所以你猜他们找了谁
<1-13,Howard>so guess who they called?

22
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,930
<1-14,Penny>什么  找你吗
<1-14,Penny>What, you? Really?!

23
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,690
<1-15,Howard>其他获邀的人都没空  于是就找我啦
<1-15,Howard>Well, a lot of people who weren't available, but then me!

24
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,460
<1-16,Penny>太酷了  恭喜你
<1-16,Penny>That's so cool! Congratulations.

25
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,680
<1-16,Penny>你现在算是你们小组里的运动健将了
<1-16,Penny>I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,190
<1-17,Sheldon>不只他是好吗
<1-17,Sheldon>Well, not just him!

<1-17,Sheldon>of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.

30
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,260
<1-18,Penny>我知道
<1-18,Penny>I know.

31
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,950
<1-18,Penny>看着自己男朋友鸡鸡下夹着一根扫把
<1-18,Penny>Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick

32
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,570

<1-20,Howard>好的  来吧
<1-20,Howard>All right, here we go.

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,140
<1-21,Raj>你看起来像个傻逼
<1-21,Raj>You look like a jackass!

36
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,830
<1-22,Howard>别闹了  你伤到人家的小心肝了
<1-22,Howard>Cut it out! You're hurting my feelings!

37
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,020
<1-23,Leonard>现在你知道我们为什么不是在外面玩了
<1-23,Leonard>Now you know why we're not outside.

44
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,480
<2-1,Sheldon>我今天的讲课还喜欢吗
<2-1,Sheldon>Did you enjoy my lecture?

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,890
<2-2,Amy>不喜欢  我们的服务员也不喜欢
<2-2,Amy>No, and neither did our waiter.

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,900
<2-3,Sheldon>如果他们要卖康沃尔童子鸡
<2-3,Sheldon>Well, if you're going to serve Cornish game hen,

47
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,480
<2-3,Sheldon>就应该对康沃尔的历史了然于胸
<2-3,Sheldon>you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,330
<2-3,Sheldon>否则就得做好准备学习
<2-3,Sheldon>or be prepared to learn it.

49
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,630
<2-4,Amy>你这话的确很难反驳
<2-4,Amy>It's hard to argue with that.

50
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,520
<2-4,Amy>我懂是因为
<2-4,Amy>And I know

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,450
<2-4,Amy>我目睹一个只是撒胡椒的服务员
<2-4,Amy>because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill

52
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,770
<2-4,Amy>数次尝试  但都失败告终
<2-4,Amy>desperately try and fail.

53
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,830
<2-5,Penny>晚餐如何
<2-5,Penny>Hey, how was dinner?

54
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,200
<2-6,Sheldon>很棒  我吃了康沃尔童子鸡
<2-6,Sheldon>Good, I had Cornish game hen.

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,430
<2-7,Leonard>可怜的服务员啊
<2-7,Leonard>Oh, that poor waiter.

56
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,700
<2-8,Amy>谢尔顿  我们明天晚上去看个电影如何
<2-8,Amy>Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?

57
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,590
<2-9,Penny>你们要连续两晚出去吗
<2-9,Penny>You guys are going out two nights in a row?

58
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,280
<2-10,Sheldon>我在火车之旅期间错过了数次约会之夜
<2-10,Sheldon>I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip,

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,370
<2-10,Sheldon>所以根据我们的恋爱合约
<2-10,Sheldon>and I'm contractually obligated to make them up

60
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,140
<2-10,Sheldon>我有义务把错过的夜晚补上
<2-10,Sheldon>under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.

61
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,330
<2-11,Penny>好热辣的恋情啊
<2-11,Penny>That's so hot.

62
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,240
<2-12,Amy>比热辣还辣  是契约"捆绑"
<2-12,Amy>It's better than hot, it's binding.

63
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,750
<2-13,Sheldon>如果你们明晚有空
<2-13,Sheldon>If you're free tomorrow night,

64
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,540
<2-13,Sheldon>我很乐意邀请你们来双重约会
<2-13,Sheldon>I'd love to have you join us on a double date.

65
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,770
<2-15,Amy>你知道双重约会不能抵两次约会的吧
<2-15,Amy>You are aware that a double date doesn't count as two dates.

66
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,220
<2-16,Sheldon>那你们爱来不来  我无所谓
<2-16,Sheldon>Well, then come or don't. I don't care.

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,530
<3-1,Bernadette>真不敢相信你腰酸背疼
<3-1,Bernadette>I can't believe you're sore.

68
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,660
<3-2,Howard>就连职业投手比赛完都需要有人按摩
<3-2,Howard>Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.

69
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,680
<3-3,Bernadette>但人家投的是真球
<3-3,Bernadette>But they throw an actual ball.

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,230
<3-3,Bernadette>你是往电视投空气
<3-3,Bernadette>You were throwing air at a TV.

71
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,870
<3-4,Howard>那我不得不提
<3-4,Howard>For your information,

72
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,670
<3-4,Howard>我还跟莱纳德来了一发超赞的击掌
<3-4,Howard>I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,410
<3-5,Bernadette>我有点惊讶你会答应
<3-5,Bernadette>I'm kind of surprised you agreed to do this

74
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,330
<3-5,Bernadette>在整个球场的人面前做这事
<3-5,Bernadette>in front of a stadium full of people.

75
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,900
<3-6,Howard>人家要办个太空日  而太空总署邀请我了
<3-6,Howard>They're doing Space Day and NASA asked me.

76
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,680
<3-6,Howard>我不好意思拒绝嘛
<3-6,Howard>I felt like I couldn't say no.

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,840
<3-6,Howard>好吧
<3-6,Howard>Okay.

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,620
<3-7,Bernadette>如果你需要  我可以帮忙你训练啊
<3-7,Bernadette>Well, if you want, I could help you practice.

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,520
<3-7,Bernadette>我成长期间打过不少垒球
<3-7,Bernadette>I played a lot of softball growing up.

80
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,480
<3-8,Howard>谢谢  这会很有帮助
<3-8,Howard>Thank you, that would be great.

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,510
<3-9,Bernadette>很好  那既然要做
<3-9,Bernadette>Great. And while we're at it,

82
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,500
<3-9,Bernadette>或许我们可以纠正你的跑步姿势
<3-9,Bernadette>maybe we could butch up your run

83
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,600
<3-9,Bernadette>好让你跑去投手丘时可以爷们点
<3-9,Bernadette>for when you head out to the mound.

84
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,990
<3-10,Howard>我的跑步姿势有啥问题
<3-10,Howard>What's wrong with the way I run?

85
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,170
<3-10,Howard>我就开个玩笑
<3-10,Howard>Oh, just kidding.

86
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,530
<3-10,Howard>当然没问题
<3-10,Howard>Nothing.

87
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,780
<4-1,Penny>谢尔顿  我有点惊讶你会选去酒吧
<4-1,Penny>Sheldon, I'm surprised you'd choose to go to a pub.

88
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,380
<4-2,Sheldon>在委员会会议时
<4-2,Sheldon>At our committee meeting,

89
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,940
<4-2,Sheldon>艾米发起了去公园野餐的提议
<4-2,Sheldon>Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park,

90
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,160
<4-2,Sheldon>我给这提议附加了一堆修正
<4-2,Sheldon>but I tacked so many amendments on that thing

91
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,900
<4-2,Sheldon>提议就像铅做的气球一样坠落了
<4-2,Sheldon>it sank like a lead balloon.

92
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,670
<4-3,Amy>所以我就提议去酒吧
<4-3,Amy>I then suggested a pub.

93
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,870
<4-4,Sheldon>我一开始心中也有诸多疑虑
<4-4,Sheldon>Yeah, which I was initially skeptical of

94
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,280
<4-4,Sheldon>直到我在网上看到他们有卖约克郡布丁
<4-4,Sheldon>until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.

95
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,180
<4-5,Leonard>你都不喜欢吃约克郡布丁
<4-5,Leonard>You don't even like Yorkshire pudding.

96
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,280
<4-6,Sheldon>是啊  恶心透了
<4-6,Sheldon>No, it's yucky,

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,070
<4-6,Sheldon>但是教导人们约克郡的历史
<4-6,Sheldon>but informing people about the history of Yorkshire

98
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,930
<4-6,Sheldon>那就是赞赞赞了
<4-6,Sheldon>is yummy, yum-yum.

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,620
<4-7,Amy>经过一场唇枪舌战
<4-7,Amy>After a lively debate,

100
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,570
<4-7,Amy>酒吧的提议以2比0的优势通过
<4-7,Amy>that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.

101
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,120
<4-8,Leonard>真高兴看见两人这么忙碌
<4-8,Leonard>Nice to see a busy couple

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,450
<4-8,Leonard>还能坚持把官僚主义作风贯彻到底
<4-8,Leonard>keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,450
<4-9,Sheldon>无视他们  艾米  他们是嫉妒
<4-9,Sheldon>Ignore them, Amy. They're just jealous

104
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,760
<4-9,Sheldon>因为他们的感情永远不会像我们的这么好
<4-9,Sheldon>because they'll never have a relationship as good as ours.

105
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,090
<4-10,Penny>这时候他是不是要补一句"抖你玩"之类的
<4-10,Penny>Isn't this when he says "bazooka" or something?

106
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,520
<4-11,Sheldon>我不是在开玩笑
<4-11,Sheldon>I wasn't making a joke,

107
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,360
<4-11,Sheldon>我只是在陈述事实
<4-11,Sheldon>I was merely stating fact.

108
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,360
<4-11,Sheldon>我和艾米的感情比你们俩的好
<4-11,Sheldon>Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.

109
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,580
<4-12,Leonard>你不会真的这么认为  对吧
<4-12,Leonard>You don't honestly think that, do you?

110
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,110
<4-12,Leonard>对...莱纳德
<4-12,Leonard>Y... Leonard,

111
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,450
<4-13,Sheldon>我还以为你知道呢
<4-13,Sheldon>I assumed you knew.

112
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,410
<4-13,Sheldon>从感情质量来看  我们这个圈子的
<4-13,Sheldon>The ranking of relationships in our circle

113
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,790
<4-13,Sheldon>排名顺序是  我和艾米
<4-13,Sheldon>by quality is: me and Amy,

114
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,610
<4-13,Sheldon>霍华德和伯纳黛特  拉杰和他女朋友
<4-13,Sheldon>Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend,

115
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,800
<4-13,Sheldon>佩妮和夏敦埃酒  佩妮和你
<4-13,Sheldon>Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.

116
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,980
<4-14,Leonard>根本不存在什么排名
<4-14,Leonard>There isn't any ranking.

117
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,850
<4-14,Leonard>就算有  我们也不可能垫底啊
<4-14,Leonard>And if there were, we wouldn't be at the bottom of it.

118
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,000
<4-15,Penny>就是  而且我喝的是白苏维翁酒
<4-15,Penny>Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.

119
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,790
<4-16,Leonard>所以你只对酒名错了有意见吗
<4-16,Leonard>That's the part you have a problem with?

120
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,600
<4-17,Penny>安啦
<4-17,Penny>Relax.

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,660
<4-18,Amy>瞧  他们又吵起来了
<4-18,Amy>There they go, fighting again.

122
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,560
<4-18,Amy>你绝对不会听到她对白苏维翁酒这么说话
<4-18,Amy>You'd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.

123
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,970
<5-1,Raj>你小时候从未打过棒球吗
<5-1,Raj>So you never played baseball as a kid,

124
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,850
<5-1,Raj>连少年棒球联盟都没参加吗
<5-1,Raj>not even Little League?

125
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,880
<5-2,Howard>我本来要去的  但选拔赛那天
<5-2,Howard>Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts

126
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,360
<5-2,Howard>我发现了我爸的《花花公子》系列藏书
<5-2,Howard>I found my dad's Playboy collection.

127
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,970
<5-2,Howard>我的手都累坏了
<5-2,Howard>Threw my arm out.

128
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,340
<5-3,Bernadette>职棒大联盟里投手丘的位置
<5-3,Bernadette>All right, the pitcher's mound in Major League Baseball

129
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,720
<5-3,Bernadette>应该是离本垒板60英尺又6英寸[18.4米]
<5-3,Bernadette>is 60 feet, six inches away from home plate.

130
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,830
<5-4,Howard>很好  你拿着这个
<5-4,Howard>Great. You take this

131
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,170
<5-4,Howard>够了就喊停
<5-4,Howard>and say when to stop.

132
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,230
<5-4,Howard>还有多远
<5-4,Howard>How much further?

133
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,620
<5-5,Bernadette>继续退
<5-5,Bernadette>Keep going.

134
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,270
<5-6,Howard>现在呢
<5-6,Howard>How about now?

135
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,140
<5-7,Bernadette>好了我会告诉你
<5-7,Bernadette>I'll let you know.

136
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,970
<5-8,Howard>你是喊停了吗
<5-8,Howard>Are you saying "stop"

137
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,340
<5-8,Howard>是不是我们太远听不见了
<5-8,Howard>and we're just too far away to hear you?

138
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,760
<5-9,Bernadette>好了  停
<5-9,Bernadette>Okay, stop.

139
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,520
<5-10,Howard>你这是在耍我吗
<5-10,Howard>Are you kidding me?!

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,120
<5-11,Bernadette>这距离就是60英尺
<5-11,Bernadette>That's 60 feet.

141
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,530
<5-12,Howard>60英尺不可能有这么远
<5-12,Howard>There's no way this is 60 feet.

142
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,440
<5-13,Bernadette>老娘看着卷尺的数呢
<5-13,Bernadette>I'm looking at it.

143
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,570
<5-14,Howard>你要明白现在不是我想要你
<5-14,Howard>You realize this isn't one of those times

144
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,080
<5-14,Howard>故意夸大"某物"长度的时候
<5-14,Howard>I want you to exaggerate how long something is.

145
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,050
<6-1,Leonard>好吧  我得...
<6-1,Leonard>Okay, I got to... I-I just...

146
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,460
<6-1,Leonard>我不得不问
<6-1,Leonard>I got to ask:

147
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,260
<6-1,Leonard>你凭什么认为你们的感情如此美妙
<6-1,Leonard>what makes you think that your relationship

148
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,890
<6-1,Leonard>而我们俩的却不是呢
<6-1,Leonard>is so wonderful and ours isn't?

149
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,400
<6-2,Sheldon>首先
<6-2,Sheldon>For starters,

150
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,110
<6-2,Sheldon>我们享受在一起的时光
<6-2,Sheldon>we enjoy spending time together.

151
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,940
<6-3,Leonard>我们也是
<6-3,Leonard>So do we.

152
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,180
<6-3,Leonard>我见过你们俩无视对方存在
<6-3,Leonard>And I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours

153
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,040
<6-3,Leonard>好几个小时  各忙各的
<6-3,Leonard>doing totally different things.

154
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,850
<6-4,Sheldon>这叫"平行游戏"
<6-4,Sheldon>It's called parallel play.

156
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,610
<6-5,Leonard>是啊  三岁小孩都这么玩
<6-5,Leonard>Yeah, toddlers do that.

158
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,160
<6-6,Sheldon>不如我们玩得好
<6-6,Sheldon>Not as well as we do.

159
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,060
<6-7,Leonard>那家伙真是有毛病  什么都要赢
<6-7,Leonard>You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.

160
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,270
<6-8,Penny>那又怎样  你干嘛这么在乎
<6-8,Penny>So what? Why do you even care?

161
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,840
<6-9,Sheldon>你听他们的对话
<6-9,Sheldon>Oh, listen to them.

162
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,710
<6-9,Sheldon>这还没结婚呢  蜜月期就已经结束了
<6-9,Sheldon>Not even married and the honeymoon's over.

163
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,450
<6-10,Leonard>随你怎么说  你连去约会
<6-10,Leonard>Whatever. You can't even go on a date

164
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,010
<6-10,Leonard>都要三番四次核查你的《恋爱协议》
<6-10,Leonard>without checking your relationship agreement.

165
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,530
<6-11,Sheldon>如果你对基于合同的关系有意见
<6-11,Sheldon>If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract,

166
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,830
<6-11,Sheldon>我想告诉你有13个有种的殖民地
<6-11,Sheldon>I'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies

167
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,840
<6-11,Sheldon>缔结了一份"关系协议"
<6-11,Sheldon>that entered a "Relationship agreement"

168
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,430
<6-11,Sheldon>又名美国宪法
<6-11,Sheldon>called the U.S. Constitution.

169
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,690
<6-11,Sheldon>但或许这么说不太好
<6-11,Sheldon>And it may not be cool to say so,

170
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,840
<6-11,Sheldon>但我认为直至今天  那份感情都还很火热呢
<6-11,Sheldon>but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.

171
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,350
<6-12,Amy>还好我现在没穿着国旗图案的内裤
<6-12,Amy>It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now,

172
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,360
<6-12,Amy>不然它会火热的烧起来
<6-12,Amy>'cause there's about to be a fire.

173
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,050
<7-1,Bernadette>其实没那么难
<7-1,Bernadette>Okay, it's not that hard.

174
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,850
<7-1,Bernadette>你只需看着你要投球的地方
<7-1,Bernadette>You just look to where you want to throw it,

175
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,470
<7-1,Bernadette>朝着那方向往前迈一步
<7-1,Bernadette>step towards where you want to throw,

176
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,610
<7-1,Bernadette>然后把球投出去
<7-1,Bernadette>and throw it.

177
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
<7-2,Howard>这就是你的建议吗
<7-2,Howard>That's your help?

178
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,050
<7-2,Howard>就好像在说"开飞机的步骤如下:
<7-2,Howard>That's like saying, "Here's how you fly a plane:

179
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,240
<7-2,Howard>首先上飞机
<7-2,Howard>Get in the airplane,

180
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,490
<7-2,Howard>知道目的地  然后开飞机"
<7-2,Howard>know where you want to go and fly it."

181
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,780
<7-3,Bernadette>先投球试试  看看你的实力
<7-3,Bernadette>Just throw the ball. Let's see what we're working with.

182
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,020
<7-4,Raj>加油  霍华德  燃烧你的小宇宙
<7-4,Raj>Come on Howard, fire it in.

183
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
<7-5,Bernadette>快给老娘投球
<7-5,Bernadette>Throw the damn ball!

184
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,150
<8-1,Amy>你们俩打算什么时候结婚
<8-1,Amy>So when do you guys plan on getting married?

185
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,280
<8-2,Penny>还不确定  但我想再等等
<8-2,Penny>Uh, we're not sure. But I want to wait long enough

186
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,810
<8-2,Penny>证明给我妈看  我不是带球结婚
<8-2,Penny>to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.

187
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,190
<8-3,Sheldon>我可以吃一根你的薯条吗
<8-3,Sheldon>May I have one of your fries?

188
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,320
<8-4,Amy>当然可以
<8-4,Amy>Of course.

189
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,740
<8-4,Amy>我可以咬一口你的汉堡吗
<8-4,Amy>Can I have a bite of your burger?

190
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,420
<8-5,Sheldon>当然不可以
<8-5,Sheldon>Absolutely not.

191
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,220
<8-6,Leonard>真是"完美"的一对
<8-6,Leonard>Some perfect couple.

192
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,900
<8-6,Leonard>他连食物都不愿意跟她分享
<8-6,Leonard>He won't even share his food with her.

193
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,850
<8-7,Sheldon>汉堡有牛油果
<8-7,Sheldon>It has avocado on it.

194
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,890
<8-7,Sheldon>而她对牛油果过敏
<8-7,Sheldon>She's allergic to avocado.

195
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,040
<8-7,Sheldon>你嫉妒我和艾米到
<8-7,Sheldon>Are you so jealous of our relationship

196
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,090
<8-7,Sheldon>想她死这么严重吗
<8-7,Sheldon>you want Amy to die?

197
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,120
<8-8,Leonard>我才没有嫉妒
<8-8,Leonard>I'm not jealous.

198
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,580
<8-8,Leonard>我只是觉得你把恋爱
<8-8,Leonard>I just think it's silly for you to compare relationships

199
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,010
<8-8,Leonard>拿来比较  就跟感情可以量化一样
<8-8,Leonard>like they're something that can be quantified.

200
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,990
<8-9,Sheldon>任何事物都可以量化
<8-9,Sheldon>Everything is quantifiable.

201
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,380
<8-9,Sheldon>这炸薯条  7分
<8-9,Sheldon>That French fry? A seven.

202
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,650
<8-9,Sheldon>《蜘蛛侠》  9分
<8-9,Sheldon>Spider-Man? A nine.

203
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,040
<8-9,Sheldon>9这个数  奇怪的是只能得4分
<8-9,Sheldon>The number nine-- oddly, only a four.

204
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,410
<8-10,Leonard>-这家伙有多奇怪啊  -百分百
<8-10,Leonard>- How ridiculous is he? - A hundred.

205
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,750
<8-12,Leonard>谢尔顿  你这只是按自己的喜好
<8-12,Leonard>Sheldon, you're just assigning random numbers

206
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,520
<8-12,Leonard>给东西乱打分罢了
<8-12,Leonard>to things based on your opinion.

207
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,800
<8-12,Leonard>才不是呢
<8-12,Leonard>No, I'm not.

208
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,820
<8-13,Sheldon>炸薯条有三个变量
<8-13,Sheldon>French fries have three variables--

209
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,960
<8-13,Sheldon>松脆度  含盐量  形状
<8-13,Sheldon>crispiness, saltiness and shape.

210
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,550
<8-13,Sheldon>所以卷卷薯条只能得2分
<8-13,Sheldon>Which is why a curly fry only gets a two.

211
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,100
<8-13,Sheldon>如果想吃卷卷  我还不如点盘小丑的假发呢
<8-13,Sheldon>If I wanted curls for dinner, I'd order a clown wig.

212
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,930
<8-14,Penny>恋爱比炸薯条复杂多了
<8-14,Penny>Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.

213
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,460
<8-15,Sheldon>贝尔伊德  施奈德和尾本的研究可不是这么说的
<8-15,Sheldon>Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.

214
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,050
<8-16,Penny>那三个流氓又说了什么
<8-16,Penny>Oh, what did those rascals do now?

215
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,040
<8-17,Amy>他们编写了恋爱亲密度问卷
<8-17,Amy>They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory,

216
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,750
<8-17,Amy>用行为来预测恋人关系的稳定度
<8-17,Amy>which predicts the stability of a couple based on behavior.

217
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,190
<8-18,Sheldon>不要和炸薯条
<8-18,Sheldon>Yeah, not to be confused

218
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,190
<8-18,Sheldon>好坏问卷搞混了
<8-18,Sheldon>with the French Fry Goodness Inventory.

219
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,010
<8-18,Sheldon>那个是我库珀的大作
<8-18,Sheldon>That's pure Cooper.

220
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,560
<8-19,Leonard>这问卷准确性高吗
<8-19,Leonard>So, this is accurate?

221
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,360
<8-20,Sheldon>已经流行了25年
<8-20,Sheldon>It's been around for 25 years,

222
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,190
<8-20,Sheldon>也被其他研究者普遍证实有效
<8-20,Sheldon>and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.

223
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,740
<8-21,Penny>这不会让恋爱有点不浪漫吗
<8-21,Penny>Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.

224
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,940
<8-22,Sheldon>有点  是完全不浪漫好吧
<8-22,Sheldon>Kind of? It does it perfectly.

225
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,060
<8-23,Amy>谢尔顿和我得了8.2分
<8-23,Amy>Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.

226
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,480
<8-24,Leonard>好  我们马上就做
<8-24,Leonard>Fine. We'll take it right now.

227
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,510
<8-26,Leonard>-别做  -怎么了
<8-26,Leonard>- No, don't. - What?

228
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,030
<8-27,Penny>-别做就是了  -为什么啊
<8-27,Penny>- Just don't take it. - Why not?

229
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,770
<8-29,Penny>这太傻了  谁在乎得多少分呢
<8-29,Penny>'Cause it's stupid. Who cares what number it is?

230
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,920
<8-30,Leonard>别这样  挺好玩的
<8-30,Leonard>Come on. It'll be fun.

231
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,840
<8-31,Penny>我说了不让你做
<8-31,Penny>I said I don't want you to.

232
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,580
<8-31,Penny>我再去拿杯酒
<8-31,Penny>I'm getting another drink.

233
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,720
<8-32,Leonard>抱歉
<8-32,Leonard>Sorry.

234
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,920
<8-33,Amy>这次就算你两次约会吧
<8-33,Amy>I'm gonna let you count this as two dates.

235
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,680
<8-33,Amy>他们真是好累人啊
<8-33,Amy>They're a lot of work.

236
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,200
<9-1,Bernadette>觉得他有进步吗
<9-1,Bernadette>Think he's getting any better?

237
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,600
<9-2,Raj>有进步
<9-2,Raj>Yup.

238
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,630
<9-3,Howard>就差一点而已
<9-3,Howard>That was a close one!

239
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,960
<9-4,Bernadette>好的
<9-4,Bernadette>Okay!

240
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,260
<9-5,Raj>他不能推掉邀请了吗
<9-5,Raj>Is it too late for him to cancel?

241
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,850
<9-6,Bernadette>大概是吧
<9-6,Bernadette>I think so.

242
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,030
<9-7,Howard>小心啦  球来了
<9-7,Howard>Heads up! Watch out!

243
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,180
<10-1,Leonard>你生气了吗
<10-1,Leonard>Are you mad at me?

244
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,510
<10-2,Penny>别傻了  我没生气
<10-2,Penny>No, stop being stupid.

245
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,130
<10-3,Leonard>我...松了口气
<10-3,Leonard>Um... whew?

246
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,080
<10-3,Leonard>你是气测试  还是气我们俩
<10-3,Leonard>Is this about the test, or is this about us?

247
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,200
<10-4,Penny>我不需要通过测试
<10-4,Penny>Look, I don't need a score on a test

248
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,470
<10-4,Penny>让我担心原本就在担心的事情
<10-4,Penny>to make me worry about something I'm already worried about.

249
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,900
<10-5,Leonard>你担心什么呢
<10-5,Leonard>What are you worried about?

250
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,100
<10-6,Penny>我们订婚了  可我们没什么共同点
<10-6,Penny>That we're engaged and have nothing in common,

251
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,020
<10-6,Penny>这让我很害怕
<10-6,Penny>and it scares me.

252
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,370
<10-7,Leonard>我也挺害怕的
<10-7,Leonard>Yeah, that scares me, too.

253
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,480
<10-8,Penny>真的吗
<10-8,Penny>It does?

254
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,990
<10-9,Leonard>有时候吧
<10-9,Leonard>Sometimes.

255
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,100
<10-10,Penny>这可不是好事啊
<10-10,Penny>Well, that's not good!

256
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,200
<10-10,Penny>咱俩感情中坚固的基础
<10-10,Penny>You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock

257
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,460
<10-10,Penny>就是你盲目地迷恋我
<10-10,Penny>we were building this relationship on!

258
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,820
<10-11,Leonard>那这么说会不会让你感觉好一点
<10-11,Leonard>Okay, well, this might make you feel better.

259
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,960
<10-11,Leonard>我俩都害怕婚姻会变成一场灾难
<10-11,Leonard>Uh, we're both scared that our marriage will be a disaster,

260
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,700
<10-11,Leonard>这就是我俩的共同点嘛
<10-11,Leonard>and so, that's something that we have in common.

261
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,410
<10-11,Leonard>而且  我俩都觉得我这人不好笑
<10-11,Leonard>Also, we both think I'm not funny.

262
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,880
<10-11,Leonard>看吧  你连笑都不笑
<10-11,Leonard>Huh? See, you're not laughing.

263
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,780
<11-1,Mike (on Skype)>果麦圈客  你好啊
<11-1,Mike (on Skype)>Hey, Froot Loops, what's up?

264
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,760
<11-2,Howard>麦克  你好
<11-2,Howard>Hey, Mike.

265
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,170
<11-2,Howard>航天总局邀请我
<11-2,Howard>Listen, NASA asked me to

266
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,370
<11-2,Howard>为天使队开球
<11-2,Howard>throw out the first pitch at an Angels game.

267
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,910
<11-2,Howard>你能给我点建议吗
<11-2,Howard>You got any advice?

268
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,080
<11-3,Mike>可以  不要去
<11-3,Mike>Yeah. Don't do it.

269
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
<11-3,Mike>你还有什么事
<11-3,Mike>What else you up to?

270
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,310
<11-4,Howard>我为什么不能去呢
<11-4,Howard>Why shouldn't I do it?

271
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,530
<11-5,Mike>这事就没好处
<11-5,Mike>There's no upside.

272
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,230
<11-5,Mike>你开了好球  没人会在意
<11-5,Mike>If you do well, no one cares.

273
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,510
<11-5,Mike>如果你搞砸了
<11-5,Mike>And if you screw up,

274
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,830
<11-5,Mike>你的蠢态将在视频网站上千古流传
<11-5,Mike>you're an idiot on YouTube forever.

275
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,860
<11-6,Howard>可这是为了公益啊
<11-6,Howard>But it's for a good cause.

276
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,680
<11-6,Howard>都是为了全场看比赛的孩子们啊
<11-6,Howard>What about all the kids that'll be there?

277
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,100
<11-7,Mike>所以我才这么建议你
<11-7,Mike>That's what I'm telling you.

278
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,930
<11-7,Mike>小孩最贱了
<11-7,Mike>Kids are the worst.

279
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,620
<11-7,Mike>我亲生女儿上微博宣传我有个大鼻子
<11-7,Mike>My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.

280
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,830
<11-8,Howard>没准我投了个好球呢
<11-8,Howard>Well, maybe I'll do a good job.

281
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,920
<11-8,Howard>这可说不准
<11-8,Howard>I don't know.

282
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,880
<11-9,Mike>在太空里你连只笔都丢不过来
<11-9,Mike>In space, you couldn't even toss me a pen,

283
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,860
<11-9,Mike>那时候还是零重力呢
<11-9,Mike>and that was in zero gravity.

284
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,840
<11-10,Howard>谢谢你给我打气
<11-10,Howard>Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,770
<11-11,Mike>替我问候你的太太
<11-11,Mike>Give your wife a hug for me.

287
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,970
<11-11,Mike>她比你可爱一万倍
<11-11,Mike>She's so much cuter than you,

288
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,770
<11-11,Mike>都不知道你怎么泡到的
<11-11,Mike>I don't know how you ever got her.

289
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,890
<11-12,Bernadette>他人真好
<11-12,Bernadette>He's so nice.

290
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,490
<12-1,Penny>不好意思
<12-1,Penny>Hey, sorry about that.

291
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,970
<12-1,Penny>不  是我们不好意思
<12-1,Penny>No, we're sorry.

292
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,150
<12-2,Amy>我们一开始就不应该比较感情
<12-2,Amy>We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.

293
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,420
<12-3,Sheldon>凭什么呀  我们赢了
<12-3,Sheldon>Why? We won.

294
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,420
<12-3,Sheldon>下次咱跟库萨帕里和他的狗约会吧
<12-3,Sheldon>You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog.

295
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,480
<12-3,Sheldon>给我们来点有难度的对手
<12-3,Sheldon>Really give ourselves a challenge.

296
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,970
<12-4,Leonard>我只想多说一点
<12-4,Leonard>I just want to say one more thing about this.

297
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,250
<12-4,Leonard>佩妮和我是完全不同的人
<12-4,Leonard>Just because Penny and I are very different people

298
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,640
<12-4,Leonard>并不代表我们是差劲的情侣
<12-4,Leonard>does not mean that we're a bad couple.

299
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,740
<12-5,Sheldon>一个简单测试便知答案
<12-5,Sheldon>The answer is one simple test away.

300
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,220
<12-5,Sheldon>就像那次我以为
<12-5,Sheldon>You know, it's like when I thought

301
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,360
<12-5,Sheldon>我的衣柜里有负鼠一样
<12-5,Sheldon>there was a possum in my closet.

302
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,960
<12-5,Sheldon>我只是袖手旁观怀疑吗
<12-5,Sheldon>Did I sit around wondering?

303
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,850
<12-5,Sheldon>不  我派莱纳德带着尖头棍和袋子一探究竟
<12-5,Sheldon>No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.

304
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,040
<12-6,Leonard>我杀了他的楚巴卡拖鞋
<12-6,Leonard>I killed his Chewbacca slippers.

305
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,430
<12-7,Penny>我们接受测试
<12-7,Penny>Let's just take the test.

306
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,700
<12-8,Leonard>不  我不想
<12-8,Leonard>No, no, no, I don't want to.

307
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,360
<12-9,Penny>因为你知道我们的分数会很差
<12-9,Penny>Oh, well, 'cause you know we're gonna do bad.

308
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,710
<12-10,Leonard>因为这根本不重要
<12-10,Leonard>Because it doesn't matter.

309
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,190
<12-10,Leonard>我不在乎我们得10分还是2分
<12-10,Leonard>I don't care if we're a ten or a two.

310
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,980
<12-11,Sheldon>或1分  1分也是有可能的
<12-11,Sheldon>Or a one. A one is possible.

311
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,310
<12-12,Leonard>婚姻令人害怕
<12-12,Leonard>Marriage is scary.

312
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,860
<12-12,Leonard>你害怕  我害怕
<12-12,Leonard>You're scared, I'm scared.

313
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,690
<12-12,Leonard>但这并没有令我不想结婚
<12-12,Leonard>But it doesn't make me not want to do it.

314
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,690
<12-12,Leonard>而是
<12-12,Leonard>It-it just...

315
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,950
<12-12,Leonard>令我想牵着你的手  与你一起步入婚姻殿堂
<12-12,Leonard>makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.

316
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,260
<12-13,Penny>莱纳德
<12-13,Penny>Leonard...

317
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,910
<12-14,Amy>如果你说这样的话  我会开心死的
<12-14,Amy>It would make me so happy if you said things like that.

318
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,360
<12-15,Sheldon>我们得了8.2分
<12-15,Sheldon>We got an eight-point-two.

319
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,030
<12-15,Sheldon>相信我  你已经开心死了
<12-15,Sheldon>Trust me, you're happy.

320
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,880
<13-1,Raj>我喜欢他们在中外场设计了瀑布
<13-1,Raj>I love how they put a waterfall at center field.

321
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,850
<13-1,Raj>令整个体育场浑然一体
<13-1,Raj>It really ties the whole stadium together.

322
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,040
<13-2,Penny>瞧你  居然在聊体育
<13-2,Penny>Look at you, talking sports.

323
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,440
<13-3,Leonard>这真有意思对吗
<13-3,Leonard>This is fun, huh?

324
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,350
<13-3,Leonard>来看咱们朋友投出开场球
<13-3,Leonard>We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch,

325
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,040
<13-3,Leonard>吃个热狗  看看比赛
<13-3,Leonard>have a hot dog, watch the game.

326
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,640
<13-4,Sheldon>没人说要看比赛啊
<13-4,Sheldon>Nobody said anything about watching the game.

327
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,060
<13-5,Amy>谢尔顿  那你以为会做什么
<13-5,Amy>Sheldon, what did you expect?

328
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,650
<13-6,Sheldon>我以为看霍华德投球
<13-6,Sheldon>I expected to see Howard throw the baseball,

329
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,140
<13-6,Sheldon>吃完热狗
<13-6,Sheldon>finish my hot dog,

330
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,080
<13-6,Sheldon>麻利地过街去迪士尼乐园
<13-6,Sheldon>and hightail it across the street to Disneyland

331
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,850
<13-6,Sheldon>正好赶上米奇的音乐大游行
<13-6,Sheldon>just in time for Mickey's Soundsational Parade.

332
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,290
<13-7,Amy>这样吧
<13-7,Amy>I'll tell you what.

333
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,550
<13-7,Amy>如果我们留下来  我就给你买棉花糖和摇头娃娃
<13-7,Amy>If we stay, I'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.

334
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,610
<13-8,Sheldon>谁的摇头娃娃
<13-8,Sheldon>Who's the bobblehead of?

335
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,250
<13-9,Amy>有区别吗
<13-9,Amy>Does it matter?

336
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,760
<13-10,Sheldon>没有  只要摇头就行
<13-10,Sheldon>No, as long as it bobbles.

337

<13-11,Bernadette>华仔  我真为你骄傲
<13-11,Bernadette>Howie, I am so proud of you.

347
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,780

350
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,230
<13-20,Penny>他真会投球吗
<13-20,Penny>Can he really throw a ball?

351
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,800
<13-21,Leonard>-咱们魁地球队中他...  -那就是不行
<13-21,Leonard>- On our Quidditch team, he... - Yeah, that's a "No."

352
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,840
<13-23,Howard>我要对今天在座的年轻人说几句
<13-23,Howard>I have a message for the young people here today.

353
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,190
<13-23,Howard>当我被邀请来开球时
<13-23,Howard>When I was asked to throw the first pitch,

354
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,590
<13-23,Howard>我脑袋里有个小声音说  "你不行"
<13-23,Howard>a little voice in my head said I couldn't do it.

355
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,720
<13-23,Howard>所以我反复练习
<13-23,Howard>So, I practiced and practiced,

356
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,280
<13-23,Howard>你们猜怎样
<13-23,Howard>and you know what?

357
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,260
<13-23,Howard>那个小声音
<13-23,Howard>That little voice...

358
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,090
<13-23,Howard>是正确的  但是
<13-23,Howard>...was right, but...

359
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,010
<13-23,Howard>我想起我不是运动员
