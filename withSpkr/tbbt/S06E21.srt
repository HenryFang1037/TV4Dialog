1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,750
<1-1,Sheldon>不是吧
<1-1,Sheldon>Oh, dear.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,460
<1-1,Sheldon>佩妮  你是不是又用我们的
<1-1,Sheldon>Penny, have you been recording shows

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,580
<1-1,Sheldon>-硬盘录像机录节目  -没有啊
<1-1,Sheldon>- on our DVR again? - No.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,500
<1-2,Penny>说实话就行了  这又不是在审问你
<1-2,Penny>Answer honestly. This is not a trial.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,380
<1-3,Sheldon>之后才会审问
<1-3,Sheldon>That'll come later.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,140
<1-4,Penny>我绝对没有
<1-4,Penny>Absolutely not.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,010
<1-4,Penny>快帮帮我  我不能再被他记过了
<1-4,Penny>Help me out here. I can't afford another demerit.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,270
<1-4,Penny>行
<1-4,Penny>Yeah.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,580
<1-5,Leonard>我们可能是被黑客攻击了呢
<1-5,Leonard>Uh... maybe we were hacked.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,550
<1-5,Leonard>中国那边最近不是在到处网络攻击吗
<1-5,Leonard>You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,520
<1-6,Sheldon>他们为啥要黑我们的录像机来录《百货战警》
<1-6,Sheldon>Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,100
<1-6,Sheldon>我也不知道
<1-6,Sheldon>I don't know.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,370
<1-7,Leonard>看胖子骑电动代步车  哪国人都会觉得好笑
<1-7,Leonard>It's a fat guy on a Segway. That's funny everywhere.

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,170
<1-8,Sheldon>我要把它删了
<1-8,Sheldon>I'm deleting it.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,460
<1-9,Penny>先别删啊
<1-9,Penny>Well, hang on.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,460
<1-9,Penny>那中国黑客可能还没看完呢
<1-9,Penny>Maybe the Chinese haven't finished watching it yet.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,520
<1-10,Leonard>如果录像机空间不够  要删东西
<1-10,Leonard>You know, if you're trying to make space on the DVR,

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,360
<1-10,Leonard>你怎么不把那些
<1-10,Leonard>why don't you just get rid of

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,840
<1-10,Leonard>你看过的影片给删了啊
<1-10,Leonard>some of the stuff you've already watched?

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,760
<1-10,Leonard>比如《阿尔法战士》
<1-10,Leonard>Like, um... Alphas.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,530
<1-11,Sheldon>不行  这是它的第二季季末集呢
<1-11,Sheldon>No, that's the season two finale.

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,740
<1-11,Sheldon>最后留了个大悬念
<1-11,Sheldon>That was quite the cliffhanger.

23
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,010
<1-11,Sheldon>第三季开始前我要再温习一遍剧情
<1-11,Sheldon>I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts.

24
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,860
<1-12,Leonard>不会有第三季  这剧被砍了
<1-12,Leonard>There is no season three. They canceled that show.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,440
<1-13,Sheldon>他们不能砍这个剧
<1-13,Sheldon>Well, they can't cancel it.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,650
<1-13,Sheldon>季末留了大悬念呢
<1-13,Sheldon>It ended on a cliffhanger.

27
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,470
<1-14,Leonard>-他们就是砍了  -谢尔顿
<1-14,Leonard>- They did. - Uh, Sheldon,

28
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,200
<1-15,Penny>还剩两个水饺  你要吃吗
<1-15,Penny>there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,970
<1-16,Sheldon>还水饺
<1-16,Sheldon>Dumplings?

30
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,530
<1-16,Sheldon>你没懂现在情况多严重吗
<1-16,Sheldon>Don't you understand what's going on here?

31
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,530
<1-17,Penny>想也知道  没懂
<1-17,Penny>As a rule, no.

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,670
<1-18,Sheldon>这剧季末剧情演到  全纽约居民
<1-18,Sheldon>That show ended with all the residents of New York

33
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,420
<1-18,Sheldon>全死或是全昏迷了
<1-18,Sheldon>either dead or unconscious.

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,340
<1-18,Sheldon>现在我没机会知道后续发展了
<1-18,Sheldon>Now I'll never know what happened.

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,490
<1-19,Penny>你怎么不自己编个后续出来呢
<1-19,Penny>Well, why don't you make up your own ending?

36
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,860
<1-20,Sheldon>行啊  这主意太棒了
<1-20,Sheldon>Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea.

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,360
<1-20,Sheldon>我编完之后
<1-20,Sheldon>And after that,

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,490
<1-20,Sheldon>干脆再自编个口腔卫生规矩好了
<1-20,Sheldon>I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene.

39
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,890
<1-20,Sheldon>例如以后再也不剔牙  而是把布丁涂牙龈上
<1-20,Sheldon>You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums.

40
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,660
<1-20,Sheldon>我要找出科幻台的电话
<1-20,Sheldon>I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,770
<1-20,Sheldon>给他们点教训
<1-20,Sheldon>and give them what for.

42
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,420
<1-21,Leonard>求你了  别这样
<1-21,Leonard>Oh, please, don't do that.

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,930
<1-22,Sheldon>一定要  他们怎么能砍了这样的剧呢
<1-22,Sheldon>No. They can't just cancel a show like Alphas.

44
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,770
<1-22,Sheldon>他们应该帮助观众放手才对啊
<1-22,Sheldon>You know? They have to help the viewers let go.

45
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,120
<1-22,Sheldon>《萤火虫》出了电影版来收尾
<1-22,Sheldon>Firefly did a movie to wrap things up.

46
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,220
<1-22,Sheldon>《吸血鬼猎人巴菲》以漫画继续延伸了下去
<1-22,Sheldon>Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book.

47
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,540
<1-22,Sheldon>《英雄》的剧情一季比一季烂
<1-22,Sheldon>Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season

48
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,350
<1-22,Sheldon>到结尾时  观众还感到庆幸呢
<1-22,Sheldon>till we were grateful it ended.

49
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,950
<1-23,Penny>我替要接到他电话的人感到难过
<1-23,Penny>I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,040
<1-24,Leonard>不需要
<1-24,Leonard>Ah, don't.

51
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,980
<1-24,Leonard>要是不想接到疯狂宅男粉的斥责电话
<1-24,Leonard>If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds,

52
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,290
<1-24,Leonard>那他们当初就不应该开这个科幻台
<1-24,Leonard>they shouldn't have started a Sci-Fi channel.

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,030
<1-24,Leonard>生活大爆炸
<1-24,Leonard>第六季  第二十一集

54
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,610
<2-1,Howard>你之后一定会对这个摄像头
<2-1,Howard>I think you're gonna be really happy

55
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,880
<2-1,Howard>感到十分满意
<2-1,Howard>with this security camera.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,990
<2-1,Howard>镜头很棒
<2-1,Howard>The optics are great,

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,830
<2-1,Howard>还有内置红外线技术
<2-1,Howard>it's got infrared technology,

58
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,230
<2-1,Howard>而且还附带备用电池  停电时也能运作
<2-1,Howard>and there's even a backup battery when the power goes out.

59
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,800
<2-2,Raj>都行啦
<2-2,Raj>Whatever.

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,070
<2-2,Raj>反正我能在上班时
<2-2,Raj>I can see my little princess

61
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,790
<2-2,Raj>看到我的小公主  对吧
<2-2,Raj>while I'm at work, right?

62
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,260
<2-3,Howard>你不能像个正常男人那样上班偷看黄片吗
<2-3,Howard>Why can't you just watch porn like a regular guy?

63
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,930
<2-3,Howard>把你的电脑给我  我得调试下软件
<2-3,Howard>I need your laptop so I can configure the software.

64
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,480
<2-4,Raj>等等
<2-4,Raj>Wait, hold on.

65
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,000
<2-4,Raj>奇了怪了
<2-4,Raj>This is weird.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,690
<2-5,Howard>怎么了
<2-5,Howard>What?

67
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,480
<2-6,Raj>我刚在网上搜我对象的资料
<2-6,Raj>I was Googling that girl I've been dating,

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,670
<2-6,Raj>然后找到了她的博客
<2-6,Raj>and I found her blog.

69
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,810
<2-7,Howard>厉害
<2-7,Howard>Cool.

70
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,010
<2-7,Howard>有"有料"的内容吗
<2-7,Howard>Anything juicy?

71
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,970
<2-8,Raj>她说最近在跟一个叫罗杰的人约会
<2-8,Raj>She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger?

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,030
<2-8,Raj>他还是印度人
<2-8,Raj>And he's Indian?

73
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,630
<2-8,Raj>而且他也是个天体物理学家
<2-8,Raj>And he's an astrophysicist, too?

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,990
<2-9,Howard>你知道这是怎么回事吧
<2-9,Howard>You know what's going on, don't you?

75
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,180
<2-10,Raj>没错  我妈说得太对了
<2-10,Raj>Yes. Mummy was right.

76
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,460
<2-10,Raj>美国的女人全都是淫荡饥渴骚货
<2-10,Raj>American girls are sexually voracious devils.

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,900
<2-11,Howard>没想到我居然得跟你解释这事
<2-11,Howard>I can't believe I have to explain this.

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,380
<2-11,Howard>很多人都会在博客上用假名来保持隐私
<2-11,Howard>People change names on blogs to protect their privacy.

79
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,280
<2-11,Howard>罗杰就是拉杰
<2-11,Howard>Roger is Raj.

80
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,090
<2-12,Raj>我一直以为  如果我要有个白人名
<2-12,Raj>I always thought, if I had a white name,

81
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,810
<2-12,Raj>那我会叫盖伦
<2-12,Raj>it would be Gavin.

82
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,900
<2-13,Howard>继续读啊  看她都说了啥
<2-13,Howard>Keep reading. What does it say?

83
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,620
<2-14,Raj>不行不行  这不太好吧
<2-14,Raj>No, no, I don't know if I should.

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,030
<2-14,Raj>如果她想我知道她有博客  早就告诉我了
<2-14,Raj>If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me.

85
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,750
<2-14,Raj>这就跟偷看她日记一样
<2-14,Raj>It's almost like I'm reading her diary.

86
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,500
<2-15,Howard>这就是偷看她日记啊  继续读
<2-15,Howard>That's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,510
<2-16,Raj>不行  这太没节操了
<2-16,Raj>No, this is creepy.

88
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,970
<2-17,Howard>从我帮你安装好摄像头的那一刻起
<2-17,Howard>Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror

89
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,770
<2-17,Howard>节操就已成路人了
<2-17,Howard>when I put up that camera.

90
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,910
<2-18,Raj>我们正常得很  别听他瞎说
<2-18,Raj>It's not creepy. Don't listen to him.

91
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,570
<2-18,Raj>瞧呀  哪个小姑娘的亲亲这么香啊
<2-18,Raj>Oh, look who's got the sweetest kisses.

92
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,080
<2-19,Howard>要让你们独处吗
<2-19,Howard>Should I go?

93
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,110
<3-1,Leonard>在听完谢尔顿说了这么多电视剧后
<3-1,Leonard>With all the TV Sheldon was talking about,

94
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,870
<3-1,Leonard>我有了一个绝妙的好主意
<3-1,Leonard>I had the greatest idea ever.

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,990
<3-1,Leonard>比我要开名为
<3-1,Leonard>It even blows away my idea

96
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,370
<3-1,Leonard>"楚巴咖啡厅"星战主题咖啡厅的主意还棒
<3-1,Leonard>for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called "Brewbacca's."

98
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,740
<3-1,Leonard>那就是让你看《吸血鬼猎人巴菲》
<3-1,Leonard>You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

99
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,560
<3-1,Leonard>这剧超适合我们情侣一同观赏
<3-1,Leonard>It is the perfect show for the two of us.

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,030
<3-1,Leonard>集火爆动作与搞笑一体
<3-1,Leonard>It's got action and jokes

101
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,840
<3-1,Leonard>有性感吸血鬼加浪漫爱情  怎么夸都不过分
<3-1,Leonard>and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this!

102
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,240
<11-8,Raj>你怎么说
<11-8,Raj>What do you say?

103
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,860
<3-2,Penny>现在是清晨六点半
<3-2,Penny>It's 6:30 in the morning.

104
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,520
<3-3,Leonard>你不是在农场长大的吗
<3-3,Leonard>I thought you grew up on a farm.

105
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,640
<3-3,Leonard>你好  科幻台吗
<3-3,Leonard>Hello, SyFy Network?

<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas.

<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我们要立刻反取消节目
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately.

<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that,

110
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,050
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>告诉他们我是谁
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>you tell them it's me,

112
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,890
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我是不是真是我自己所说的这个人的问题
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>about if I really am who I say I am, you know?

<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>No, I am not the person who just called.

115
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,180
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>那个人很显然是个牛仔
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>That man was clearly a cowboy.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,330
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>对  他只是单纯地关心
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Yeah, who was plumb concerned

<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>你们取消了他最喜爱的电视剧
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>about y'all canceling his favorite show.

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,670
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>他们为什么总是挂我电话
<4-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Why do they keep hanging up on me?

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,190
<4-2,Amy>很遗憾你这么难过
<4-2,Amy>I'm sorry you're upset.

120
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,770
<4-2,Amy>知道吗  谢尔顿  在这种时刻
<4-2,Amy>You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort

121
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,770
<4-2,Amy>有些人会寻求身体接触带来的安慰
<4-2,Amy>of physical contact in moments like this.

122
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,840
<4-3,Sheldon>我才不会飞回德州
<4-3,Sheldon>I am not flying back to Texas

123
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,370
<4-3,Sheldon>就为了让我妈抱一下
<4-3,Sheldon>just so my mom can give me a hug.

124
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,290
<4-3,Sheldon>好吧
<4-3,Sheldon>Okay.

125
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,190
<4-4,Amy>我觉得你现在的情况是
<4-4,Amy>Well, what I think is going on here

126
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,020
<4-4,Amy>对于"结局"  你有种病态的需求
<4-4,Amy>is you have a pathological need for closure.

127
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,160
<4-5,Sheldon>真是胡说
<4-5,Sheldon>Oh, that's nonsense.

128
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,140
<4-5,Sheldon>你总是告诉我你的日常生活琐碎事
<4-5,Sheldon>I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time.

129
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,140
<4-5,Sheldon>我根本不关心结局是什么
<4-5,Sheldon>I don't care how they end.

130
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,250
<4-6,Amy>也许我能帮你
<4-6,Amy>You know, I might be able to help you with this.

131
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,390
<4-6,Amy>在行为神经学方面有一个领域
<4-6,Amy>There's a whole field of behavioral neuroscience

132
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,180
<4-6,Amy>研究如何重新训练神经通路
<4-6,Amy>that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways

133
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,240
<4-6,Amy>然后这样的事情便不会如此困扰你了
<4-6,Amy>so stuff like this bothers you less.

134
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,230
<4-7,Sheldon>但我刚刚对你说了
<4-7,Sheldon>Yeah, but I just told you,

135
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,680
<4-7,Sheldon>我才没纠结要有结局的问题
<4-7,Sheldon>I don't have a problem with closure.

136
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,830
<4-8,Amy>你确定吗
<4-8,Amy>You sure about that?

137
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,530
<4-9,Sheldon>相当确定
<4-9,Sheldon>Oh, quite sure.

138
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,090
<4-9,Sheldon>这不能证明什么
<4-9,Sheldon>That proves nothing.

139
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,900
<5-1,Howard>可以去吃午饭了吗
<5-1,Howard>Ready to go to lunch?

140
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,710
<5-2,Raj>你觉得我这人很女性化吗
<5-2,Raj>Do you think I'm feminine?

141
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,830
<5-3,Howard>是的  我们走
<5-3,Howard>Yeah. Let's go.

142
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,930
<5-4,Raj>多谢你了
<5-4,Raj>Thanks a lot.

143
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,440
<5-5,Howard>怎么了
<5-5,Howard>What's going on?

144
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,990
<5-6,Raj>我没忍住  我看了露西的博客
<5-6,Raj>I broke down, and I read Lucy's blog.

145
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,300
<5-6,Raj>其中有一段
<5-6,Raj>And in one of the entries,

146
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,510
<5-6,Raj>她说  我们初次见面时
<5-6,Raj>she said, when we first met,

147
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,850
<5-6,Raj>她觉得我这人有一点点女性气质
<5-6,Raj>I struck her as a little feminine.

148
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,400
<5-7,Howard>才觉得一点点而已  很好啊
<5-7,Howard>Just a little? That's great.

149
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,870
<5-8,Raj>我得跟她谈谈这个
<5-8,Raj>I have to talk to her about this.

150
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,610
<5-9,Howard>老天  为什么你们女生总要谈这谈那
<5-9,Howard>Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things?

151
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,000
<5-9,Howard>听我说
<5-9,Howard>Listen to me,

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,590
<5-9,Howard>如果她写了你们感情方面的内容
<5-9,Howard>if she's writing about your relationship,

153
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,320
<5-9,Howard>你就好好利用啊
<5-9,Howard>use it to your advantage.

154
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,060
<5-9,Howard>操纵游戏
<5-9,Howard>Rig the game.

155
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,470
<5-10,Raj>这似乎不公平吧
<5-10,Raj>Well, that doesn't seem fair.

156
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,900
<5-11,Howard>难道女生喜欢自信正常的男生多过
<5-11,Howard>Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys

157
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,280
<5-11,Howard>紧张古怪男  这样就公平吗
<5-11,Howard>more than nervous weirdos?

158
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,440
<5-12,Raj>这不公平
<5-12,Raj>No, it's not.

159
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,690
<5-12,Raj>我一直觉得这不公平
<5-12,Raj>I've always thought that was unfair.

160
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,320
<5-13,Howard>那就利用博客里的内容  让她宽衣解裤带
<5-13,Howard>So take what's in that blog and use it to get her pants off.

161
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,290
<5-14,Raj>为什么话从你的嘴里出来  就这样下流
<5-14,Raj>Why do you have to make everything so filthy?

162
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,190
<5-14,Raj>你为什么不能说博客就像是
<5-14,Raj>Why couldn't you just say the blog is like

163
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,760
<5-14,Raj>她给了我一把打开她心门的钥匙
<5-14,Raj>her giving me the key to her heart?

164
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,670
<5-15,Howard>"打开她心门的钥匙"
<5-15,Howard>"The key to her heart."

165
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,790
<5-15,Howard>真不错
<5-15,Howard>That's nice.

166
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,850
<5-15,Howard>这话是你引用别人的
<5-15,Howard>Were you quoting someone

167
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,290
<5-15,Howard>还是你腰上的娘们纹身
<5-15,Howard>or is it tattooed on the small of your back?

168
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,670
<5-16,Raj>我在引用对女人略知一二的男人的话
<5-16,Raj>I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women:

169
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,880
<5-16,Raj>艾尔顿·约翰爵士[著名同性恋歌手]
<5-16,Raj>Sir Elton John.

170
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,880
<6-1,Leonard>你喜欢吗
<6-1,Leonard>So, did you love it?

171
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,130
<6-1,Leonard>你当然喜欢了  你怎么会不喜欢呢
<6-1,Leonard>Of course you loved it. How could you not love it?

172
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,020
<6-1,Leonard>告诉我你有多喜欢
<6-1,Leonard>Tell me how much you loved it.

173
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,780
<6-2,Penny>很可爱
<6-2,Penny>It was cute.

174
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,310
<6-3,Leonard>别说可爱啊
<6-3,Leonard>Oh, don't say cute.

175
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,460
<6-3,Leonard>这个词最差劲了
<6-3,Leonard>That's the worst.

176
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,410
<6-4,Penny>可爱怎么不对了
<6-4,Penny>What's wrong with cute?

177
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,630
<6-5,Leonard>这样一形容就觉得东西小小的
<6-5,Leonard>It just makes things seem small.

178
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,310
<6-5,Leonard>有种渺小的感觉
<6-5,Leonard>It diminishes them.

179
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,370
<6-6,Penny>你这是要我不再说你的小屁屁可爱吗
<6-6,Penny>So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?

180
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,670
<6-7,Leonard>你可以不说啊  不过没人会相信你
<6-7,Leonard>You can try, but nobody's gonna believe you.

181
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,390
<6-7,Leonard>我只是不理解  为什么看这么优秀的电视剧
<6-7,Leonard>I just... I don't understand how you can watch a show that great

182
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,990
<6-7,Leonard>你却一点也不激动
<6-7,Leonard>and not be excited by it.

183
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,430
<6-8,Penny>我喜欢  我很激动
<6-8,Penny>I liked it. I'm excited.

184
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,940
<6-9,Leonard>那你的表情就配合一下啊
<6-9,Leonard>Well, then, tell your face.

185
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,540
<6-10,Penny>你想让我怎么样
<6-10,Penny>What do you want from me?

186
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,660
<6-11,Leonard>这样吧
<6-11,Leonard>You know what?

187
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,830
<6-11,Leonard>算了  我们尝试过了
<6-11,Leonard>Never mind. We gave it a shot.

188
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,280
<6-11,Leonard>看看有什么其它节目吧
<6-11,Leonard>Let's just see what else is on.

189
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,940
<6-12,Penny>拜托  别这样嘛
<6-12,Penny>Oh, come on, don't be like that.

190
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,570
<6-14,Penny>抱歉我说了可爱
<6-14,Penny>I'm sorry I called it cute.

191
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,360
<6-14,Penny>-我们再看一集  -真的吗
<6-14,Penny>- Let's watch another one. - Really?

192
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,500
<6-16,Penny>对  挺有意思的
<6-16,Penny>Yeah, it was fun.

193
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,480
<6-16,Penny>让我想起了高中时代
<6-16,Penny>Kind of reminded me of my high school.

194
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,760
<6-16,Penny>但我们没有吸血鬼  只有嗑药鬼
<6-16,Penny>But instead of vampires, we had meth heads.

195
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,940
<6-16,Penny>但两者都是夜晚冒出来  而且都是一口烂牙
<6-16,Penny>But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.

196
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,750
<6-17,Leonard>好吧
<6-17,Leonard>All right, cool.

197
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,370
<6-17,Leonard>我觉得你会更喜欢下一集
<6-17,Leonard>I-I think you'll like the next one better.

198
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,950
<6-17,Leonard>讲的是啦啦队员们遭受邪恶诅咒之苦
<6-17,Leonard>All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.

199
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,320
<6-18,Penny>这点也很像高中
<6-18,Penny>Oh. Well, that's like my high school, too.

200
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,480
<6-18,Penny>不过不是诅咒  是阴虱之苦
<6-18,Penny>But instead of a curse, it was crabs.

201
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,530
<7-1,Amy>我准备了一系列练习
<7-1,Amy>I've come up with a series of exercises

202
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,310
<7-1,Amy>帮你克服对收尾的强迫需求
<7-1,Amy>to help with your compulsive need for closure.

203
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,450
<7-2,Sheldon>我不喜欢"强迫"这个词
<7-2,Sheldon>I take issue with the word "compulsive."

204
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,640
<7-3,Amy>我的意思是
<7-3,Amy>All I'm saying is,

205
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,700
<7-3,Amy>我们生活的这个世界里  结局并不是一定...
<7-3,Amy>we live in a world where closure isn't always an op...

206
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,860
<7-4,Sheldon>会有的  好吧
<7-4,Sheldon>...Tion. Okay.

207
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,300
<7-4,Sheldon>为了论证这点  就先假设我是有问题
<7-4,Sheldon>For the sake of argument, let's say I have a problem.

208
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,670
<7-4,Sheldon>那你要如何证明我有问题呢
<7-4,Sheldon>What would be your plan for addressing it?

209
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,980
<7-5,Amy>我要重建你的大脑思路
<7-5,Amy>I'm going to recondition your brain

210
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,690
<7-5,Amy>让这种对结局的需求得以抑制
<7-5,Amy>so that the need for completion isn't so overwhelming.

211
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,360
<7-6,Sheldon>靠玩井字游戏吗
<7-6,Sheldon>By playing tic-tac-toe?

212
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,660
<7-7,Amy>对  该你了
<7-7,Amy>Yep. Your turn.

213
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,530
<7-8,Sheldon>艾米
<7-8,Sheldon>Oh, Amy.

214
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,820
<7-8,Sheldon>你现在知道为什么人们认为神经学
<7-8,Sheldon>And you wonder why people think neuroscience

215
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,670
<7-8,Sheldon>不过是小儿科的愚蠢游戏了吧
<7-8,Sheldon>is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies.

216
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,170
<7-8,Sheldon>井字游戏肯定会有赢  输  或平手的结局
<7-8,Sheldon>Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw...

217
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,910
<7-8,Sheldon>完全没办法阻止我得到结局的乐趣
<7-8,Sheldon>none of which will deny me closure.

218
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,960
<7-8,Sheldon>特别是我即将胜出的情况下
<7-8,Sheldon>Especially since I'm about to win.

219
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,430
<7-8,Sheldon>我们还没玩完呢
<7-8,Sheldon>B-But we didn't finish.

220
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,420
<7-8,Sheldon>正是
<7-8,Sheldon>Exactly.

221
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,720
<7-9,Amy>你对此有何感觉
<7-9,Amy>How does that make you feel?

222
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,370
<7-10,Sheldon>跟任何正常人一样啊
<7-10,Sheldon>The same way any normal person would.

223
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,460
<7-10,Sheldon>我想扯掉自己的脸
<7-10,Sheldon>Feel like I want to peel off my own face

224
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,300
<7-10,Sheldon>撕成两半  然后不停地撕
<7-10,Sheldon>and tear it in two and then again and again

225
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,870
<7-10,Sheldon>直到我的脸碎成渣
<7-10,Sheldon>until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.

226
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,800
<7-11,Amy>今日的治疗针对的
<7-11,Amy>And that's exactly the feeling we want to address

227
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,790
<7-11,Amy>正是这种感觉
<7-11,Amy>with this course of treatment.

228
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,810
<7-12,Sheldon>或者你可以帮个忙  抓我的鼻孔
<7-12,Sheldon>Yeah, or you could pitch in, grab a nostril

229
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,680
<7-12,Sheldon>帮我把这玩意撕下来
<7-12,Sheldon>and help me get this face off.

230
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,030
<7-13,Amy>加油啊  你行的
<7-13,Amy>Come on, you can do this.

231
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,680
<7-14,Sheldon>你不能理解这种闹心的感觉是何滋味
<7-14,Sheldon>You don't know what it's like to feel completely frustrated.

232
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,290
<7-14,Sheldon>心中逐渐建立起了强烈的欲望
<7-14,Sheldon>To have a-a desire build up within you

233
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,610
<7-14,Sheldon>最后却只能憋着  无处释放
<7-14,Sheldon>and be denied any opportunity for release.

234
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,270
<7-15,Amy>听起来是很惨啊
<7-15,Amy>Yeah, sounds like a drag.

235
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,890
<8-1,Penny>帮我分析分析
<8-1,Penny>Okay, help me out here.

236
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,190
<8-1,Penny>他为什么这么喜欢这个剧
<8-1,Penny>Why does he love this show so much?

238
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,710
<8-2,Bernadette>你明白通常都是怪物追美女
<8-2,Bernadette>I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl,

239
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,750
<8-2,Bernadette>而这里是美女追怪物吧
<8-2,Bernadette>but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?

<8-5,Penny>我就做不到那样
<8-5,Penny>I just don't get that way.

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,140
<8-5,Penny>你行吗

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,140
<8-6,Bernadette>我还记得第一次看显微镜下
<8-6,Bernadette>I remember the first time I looked through a microscope

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,620
<8-6,Bernadette>那无数微生物时的场景
<8-6,Bernadette>and saw millions of tiny microorganisms.

<8-7,Penny>瞧  我也想找点这种热情
<8-7,Penny>See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life.

<8-7,Penny>我也想有特别在乎的东西
<8-7,Penny>I mean, I want to care about things

<8-9,Penny>你这么认为吗
<8-9,Penny>You think?

<8-10,Bernadette>当然了  我们需要做的
<8-10,Bernadette>Absolutely. All we need to do is spend

257
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,940
<8-10,Bernadette>只是花点时间  找到你所热爱的东西
<8-10,Bernadette>a little time and find something you're passionate about.

258
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,670
<8-11,Penny>听起来好累啊
<8-11,Penny>That sounds like a lot of work.

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,790
<11-3,Lucy>你最喜欢的球员是谁

<11-4,Raj>不是布莱恩·博伊塔诺就是了[美国花样滑冰冠军]

<11-4,Raj>你的玉米饼好吃吗
<11-4,Raj>How's your burrito?

296
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,880
<11-5,Lucy>这饼中间还有点没化冻呢
<11-5,Lucy>It's still a little frozen in the middle.

297
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,770
<11-6,Raj>那是因为我没有读说明书的缘故
<11-6,Raj>Probably because I didn't read the instructions.

298
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,400
<11-6,Raj>我从来不看包装纸上的说明[饶舌歌手]
<11-6,Raj>No wrapper's going to tell me what to do.

299
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,300
<11-6,Raj>除非上面写的是杰斯的饶舌
<11-6,Raj>Unless his name is Jay-Z.

300
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,910
<11-7,Lucy>你有什么事吗
<11-7,Lucy>Is something going on?

301
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,880

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,350
<11-9,Lucy>我自己本身就够怪的了
<11-9,Lucy>And I'm pretty weird,

304
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,930
<11-9,Lucy>连我觉得怪  那可是真的怪
<11-9,Lucy>so I think I know what I'm talking about.

305
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,350
<11-10,Raj>我也不知道  或许是因为我最近吃的类固醇吧
<11-10,Raj>I don't know. Maybe it's all those steroids I've been taking.

306
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,940
<11-11,Lucy>我看我还是走吧
<11-11,Lucy>I think I'm gonna go.

<11-13,Lucy>Oh. I kind of just write that for myself.

313
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,390
<11-13,Lucy>我没想过会有人真来读
<11-13,Lucy>I didn't think anybody actually read it.

314
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,210
<11-14,Raj>那倒是  你藏的还挺隐秘的
<11-14,Raj>No kidding. You didn't make it easy to find.

<11-17,Lucy>拉杰  我说的女性化并不是坏事
<11-17,Lucy>Raj, I didn't say "feminine" was a bad thing.

<11-17,Lucy>我是指你又贴心又善解人意
<11-17,Lucy>I meant that you're sweet and thoughtful

336
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,280
<12-1,Penny>我思考了一下你总是为

<12-1,Penny>about stuff like Buffy or science

338
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,290
<12-1,Penny>或你和谢尔顿为了买哪个遥控器而激动吵架
<12-1,Penny>or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.

339
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,860
<12-2,Leonard>"和谐一号"已经很不错了
<12-2,Leonard>The "Harmony One" was fine.

340
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,410
<12-2,Leonard>根本没必要升级到1100型
<12-2,Leonard>We didn't need to upgrade to the 1100,

341
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,440
<12-2,Leonard>他知道我手太小拿不了那个型号的
<12-2,Leonard>which he knows is too big for my hand.

342
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,630
<12-3,Penny>你看  你这种激情就是我所没有的
<12-3,Penny>See, that's the kind of passion I didn't think I had.

343
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,870
<12-3,Penny>但我后来意识到  我对你本人就有激情
<12-3,Penny>But then I realized I'm passionate about you.

344
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,730
<12-4,Leonard>是我的可爱小翘臀起了作用吧
<12-4,Leonard>Oh... my cute little tushy strikes again.

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,050
<12-5,Penny>不  我是说真的
<12-5,Penny>No, I'm serious.

346
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,770
<12-5,Penny>我一直觉得
<12-5,Penny>Look, I've always had these plans.

<12-5,Penny>我会变成电影明星  过着五光十色的生活
<12-5,Penny>I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life,

348
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,580
<12-5,Penny>而和这些无关的东西
<12-5,Penny>and anything less than that

349
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,680
<12-5,Penny>都不值得我激动
<12-5,Penny>just wasn't worth getting excited about.

350
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,380
<12-6,Leonard>你说的那些还是有可能发生的
<12-6,Leonard>Those things can still happen.
