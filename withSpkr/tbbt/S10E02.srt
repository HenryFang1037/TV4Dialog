1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,510
<12-14,Howard>《生活大爆炸》前情提要
<12-14,Howard>Previously on The Big Bang Theory.

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,930
<7-6,Leonard>您好
<7-6,Leonard>Hello.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,790
<7-7,Sheldon>我来找霍华德·沃罗威茨
<7-7,Sheldon>I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,390
<7-8,Howard>我能问一下你找他有什么事吗
<7-8,Howard>May I ask what this is about?

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,910
<7-9,Leonard>不能问
<7-9,Leonard>No, you may not.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,530
<7-10,Sheldon’s phone>是的官爷
<7-10,Sheldon’s phone>Very well.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,730
<7-11,Colonel Williams>威廉姆斯上校  有什么需要我效劳的吗
<7-11,Colonel Williams>Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you?

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,040
<10-6,Bernadette>当然  周四见面没问题
<10-6,Bernadette>Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,730
<5-14,Marty>约加州理工学院也没问题
<5-14,Marty>Caltech is fine.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,970
<5-15,Sheldon>好  我能问问是什么事吗
<5-15,Sheldon>Yeah, and may I ask what this is about?

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,310
<5-16,Marty>不能啊
<5-16,Marty>I may not?

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,630
<11-20,Sheldon>他也是这么对我说的
<11-20,Sheldon>That's what he said to me.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,470
<11-20,Sheldon>瞧瞧
<11-20,Sheldon>Look at this.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,770
<11-20,Sheldon>埃隆·马斯克有个理论  我们每个人
<11-20,Sheldon>Elon Musk has a theory that we're all just characters

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,880
<1-1,Sheldon>都只是某高等文明的电玩游戏中的角色
<1-1,Sheldon>in some advanced civilization's video game.

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,600
<1-2,Leonard>所以有某个外星小孩花钱
<1-2,Leonard>So some alien kid spent his money

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,880
<1-2,Leonard>来帮我升了气喘加近视眼的特性吗
<1-2,Leonard>on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,650
<1-3,Sheldon>他没说是个好游戏啊
<1-3,Sheldon>Well, he doesn't say it's a good game.

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,530
<1-4,Howard (entering)>-咱们有麻烦了  -怎么了
<1-4,Howard (entering)>- All right, we got a problem. - What's up?

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,040
<1-6,Howard>空军对我们的量子陀螺仪有兴趣
<1-6,Howard>The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,660
<1-7,Leonard>-他们想见面谈谈  -真的吗
<1-7,Leonard>- They want to have a meeting. - Really?

23
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,800
<1-7,Leonard>对啊  有个军队的人来到霍华德家找他
<1-7,Leonard>Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard's door.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,330
<1-8,Raj>他可吓人了
<1-8,Raj>He was terrifying.

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,560
<1-9,Sheldon>他说什么了
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, what did he say?

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,790
<1-10,Raj>他给了我他的名片
<1-10,Raj>He gave me his business card

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,570
<1-10,Raj>然后请我把名片转交给霍华德
<1-10,Raj>and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.

28
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,680
<1-11,Sheldon>这听起来不吓人啊
<1-11,Sheldon>That doesn't sound terrifying.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,430
<1-12,Raj>土生土长的美国白人当然不觉得
<1-12,Raj>To a white guy born here, no.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,170
<1-12,Raj>但如果你是棕色皮肤  名字带很多音节的话
<1-12,Raj>If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it --

31
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,600
<1-13,Leonard>胆都吓破了好吗
<1-13,Leonard>terrifying.

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,290
<1-13,Leonard>你知道如果军方宣称我们的研究属于机密
<1-13,Leonard>You realize if the military declares our research classified,

33
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,880
<1-13,Leonard>他们可以直接把整个研究拿走吧
<1-13,Leonard>they can take the whole thing away from us.

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,750
<1-14,Howard>如果真发生这种事
<1-14,Howard>And if that happens,

35
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,350
<1-14,Howard>我们就永远不能卖做商用了
<1-14,Howard>we'll never be able to sell it commercially.

36
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,350
<1-15,Leonard>就跟这一大笔钱说再见了
<1-15,Leonard>There goes our big payday.

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,560
<1-16,Howard>我还指望拿到这笔钱呢
<1-16,Howard>I was counting on that money--

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,940
<1-16,Howard>我的收入得跟我老婆持平
<1-16,Howard>I need to make as much as my wife

39
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,720
<1-16,Howard>这样我在床上才不用这么拼死拼活
<1-16,Howard>so I don't have to try so hard in bed.

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,400
<1-17,Leonard>你也要这样吗
<1-17,Leonard>You do that, too?

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,100
<1-18,Howard>当然  不然你觉得我怎么保持这么瘦的
<1-18,Howard>Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?

42
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,380
<1-19,Sheldon>先生们  我们都忽视了真正的问题
<1-19,Sheldon>Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue.

43
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,700
<1-19,Sheldon>我们离成为军工业集合体中
<1-19,Sheldon>We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,040
<1-19,Sheldon>无名无姓的小齿轮只有一步之遥了
<1-19,Sheldon>in the military-industrial complex.

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,120
<1-19,Sheldon>这难道不让人激动吗
<1-19,Sheldon>Isn't that exciting?

46
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,610
<1-20,Raj>你是在开玩笑吧
<1-20,Raj>You're kidding, right?

47
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,300
<1-21,Sheldon>才不是呢  像《星球大战》中那些风暴兵
<1-21,Sheldon>Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers

48
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,130
<1-21,Sheldon>以完美的队形行军
<1-21,Sheldon>would march in perfect formation,

49
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,400
<1-21,Sheldon>前往骚扰民众时  你难道没有想过
<1-21,Sheldon>harassing civilians, didn't you ever think,

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,870
<1-21,Sheldon>"我也能成为这伟大军团的一员"吗
<1-21,Sheldon>"Hey, that could be me"?

51
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,250
<1-22,Howard>谢尔顿  我们可能成为
<1-22,Howard>Sheldon, we could be contributing

52
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,990
<1-22,Howard>未来几千年迫害人类的武器系统的
<1-22,Howard>to a weapons system that oppresses mankind

53
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,500
<1-22,Howard>幕后元凶呢
<1-22,Howard>for the next thousand years.

54
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,880
<1-23,Sheldon>好的  霍华德同意加入  你呢  莱纳德
<1-23,Sheldon>Okay, Howard's on board. What do you think, Leonard?

64
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,900
<2-1,Bernadette>我好担心霍华德啊
<2-1,Bernadette>I'm worried about Howard.

65
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,630
<2-1,Bernadette>打从军队的人来家里找他后
<2-1,Bernadette>Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up,

66
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,210
<2-1,Bernadette>他就被吓到尿不停
<2-1,Bernadette>he's been a nervous wreck.

67
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,120
<2-2,Penny>我们在一个大型制药公司上班
<2-2,Penny>All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company.

68
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,720
<2-2,Penny>给他搞几片抗忧郁药吃吃啊
<2-2,Penny>Get him some anti-anxiety meds.

69
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,710
<2-3,Bernadette>他不愿意吃除了摩登原始人咀嚼维生素片
<2-3,Bernadette>He won't take any pills that aren't chewable

70
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,740
<2-3,Bernadette>以外的任何药物
<2-3,Bernadette>and shaped like a Flintstone.

71
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,110
<2-4,Penny>每当莱纳德感到焦虑的时候
<2-4,Penny>You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious

72
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,680
<2-4,Penny>我就让他散步久一点
<2-4,Penny>I make him take a long walk.

73
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,880
<2-5,Amy>这招有效吗
<2-5,Amy>Does that help?

74
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,730
<2-6,Penny>有效时间就一会儿  然后这烦人精就回来了
<2-6,Penny>Well, for a while. Then he comes back.

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,110
<2-7,Bernadette>-真是不敢相信  -怎么了
<2-7,Bernadette>- I don't believe this. - What's wrong?

76
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,050
<2-9,Bernadette>有个男同事发消息来恭喜我怀孕了
<2-9,Bernadette>This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.

77
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,300
<2-10,Amy>你本来知道自己怀了孕的  对吧
<2-10,Amy>You did already know, right?

78
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,280
<2-11,Bernadette>但是同事都不知道啊
<2-11,Bernadette>No one at the office did.

79
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,590
<2-11,Bernadette>-你有告诉任何人吗  -没有
<2-11,Bernadette>- Did you tell anyone? - No.

80
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,860
<2-12,Penny>你不让我跟别人说
<2-12,Penny>You told me not to.

81
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,530
<2-13,Bernadette>肯定是搞逆转录病毒的芭芭拉·陈传出去的
<2-13,Bernadette>I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus.

82
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,590
<2-13,Bernadette>她貌似某天早上有听到我在孕吐
<2-13,Bernadette>She might have heard me throwing up one morning.

83
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,020
<2-13,Bernadette>自从她装助听器后  她就觉得自己可牛逼了
<2-13,Bernadette>Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she's so great.

84
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,890
<2-14,Amy>你为什么不想别人知道呢
<2-14,Amy>Why don't you want anyone to know?

85
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,080
<2-15,Bernadette>因为我有机会做一个免疫疗法研究的大项目
<2-15,Bernadette>'Cause I'm up for a major immunotherapy study,

86
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,070
<2-15,Bernadette>如果他们发现我怀孕了
<2-15,Bernadette>and if they find out I'm pregnant

87
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,670
<2-15,Bernadette>可能就会把机会给别人了
<2-15,Bernadette>they might give it to someone else.

88
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,010
<2-16,Penny>他们真的会这样吗
<2-16,Penny>Would they really do that?

89
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,220
<2-17,Bernadette>肯定会啊  去年芭芭拉就是这么被换掉
<2-17,Bernadette>I know they would-- they did it to Barbara Chen last year

90
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,460
<2-17,Bernadette>因为我爆料说她怀孕了
<2-17,Bernadette>when I told everyone she was pregnant.

91
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,100
<3-1,Raj>我要发条朋友圈  说我的好朋友们
<3-1,Raj>Wait till I Snapchat that my friends might be working

92
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,930
<3-1,Raj>为政府的机密项目做事
<3-1,Raj>on a top secret government project.

93
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,140
<3-2,Leonard>你是不是疯了
<3-2,Leonard>Are you crazy?

94
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,140
<3-2,Leonard>你怎么能把这事写到朋友圈
<3-2,Leonard>You can't put that on Snapchat.

95
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,600
<3-3,Raj>好吧  那我写到过时几百万年的脸书上吧
<3-3,Raj>Fine, I'll put it on Facebook like a caveman.

96
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,890
<3-4,Howard>或许应该在会面前  找个律师谈谈
<3-4,Howard>You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.

97
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,210
<3-5,Leonard>这主意不差
<3-5,Leonard>That's not a bad idea.

98
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,720
<3-6,Raj>你家族里肯定有人是律师吧
<3-6,Raj>Well, you must have someone in your family that's a lawyer.

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,770
<3-7,Howard>为啥  就因为我是犹太人吗
<3-7,Howard>Why? Because I'm Jewish?

100
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,160
<3-7,Howard>这就跟我说  "你是印度人
<3-7,Howard>That's like me saying, "Hey, you're Indian.

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,980
<3-7,Howard>你肯定有亲戚在电话客服中心工作吧"
<3-7,Howard>Doesn't your cousin work in a call center?"

102
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,260
<3-8,Raj>我还真有亲戚在电话客服中心工作
<3-8,Raj>My cousin does work in a call center.

103
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,350
<3-9,Howard>我也真有亲戚是律师
<3-9,Howard>And my cousin's a lawyer.

104
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,000
<3-10,Sheldon>我们不需要霍华德的亲戚帮忙
<3-10,Sheldon>We don't need Howard's cousin, no.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,110
<3-10,Sheldon>咱们有我啊
<3-10,Sheldon>We have me.

106
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,980
<3-11,Leonard>谢尔顿  你不是律师  你只是爱耍聪明
<3-11,Leonard>You're not a lawyer, Sheldon, you're just a know-it-all.

107
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,410
<3-12,Sheldon>我才不是耍聪明
<3-12,Sheldon>I am not a know-it-all.

108
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,960
<3-12,Sheldon>我只是个上知天文下知地理
<3-12,Sheldon>I'm a person who knows lots of things

109
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,850
<3-12,Sheldon>还喜欢在别人犯错时  热心纠正他们的人
<3-12,Sheldon>and likes to correct other people when they're wrong.

110
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,720
<3-13,Leonard>这就是所谓爱耍聪明的人啊
<3-13,Leonard>That's the definition of being a know-it-all.

111
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,070
<3-14,Sheldon>或是德文里的"砖家"
<3-14,Sheldon>Or in German, a Besserwisser.

112
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,220
<4-1,Penny>你怎么能觉得你能瞒住你怀孕的事实
<4-1,Penny>How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?

113
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,840
<4-2,Bernadette>我有整套计划  我一直有四处留下巧克力棒包装
<4-2,Bernadette>I had a plan-- I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around

114
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,920
<4-2,Bernadette>来解释我为什么发福了
<4-2,Bernadette>to explain any weight gain.

115
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,680
<4-3,Amy>那你是上哪去弄的空巧克力棒包装纸
<4-3,Amy>Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?

116
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,460
<4-4,Bernadette>当然是我吃完故意留的包装啊  老娘怀孕了
<4-4,Bernadette>From all the Dove Bars I ate! I'm pregnant!

117
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,240
<4-4,Bernadette>用点脑想想好吗
<4-4,Bernadette>Try to keep up!

118
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,260
<4-4,Bernadette>抱歉  我得去看看我老板发现没
<4-4,Bernadette>I'm sorry. I-I have to go find out if my boss knows.

119
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,370
<4-5,Amy>无论如何  我们都会支持你
<4-5,Amy>Well, whatever happens, we're here for you.

120
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,560
<4-6,Bernadette>谢谢  你们最好了
<4-6,Bernadette>Thanks. You guys are the best.

121
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,230
<4-7,Penny>开车小心  我们爱你  到了打电话...
<4-7,Penny>Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call...

122
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,310
<4-7,Penny>要死了  是我  是我传的
<4-7,Penny>Oh, my God, it was me, it was me!

123
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,090
<4-7,Penny>是我大嘴巴告诉别人她怀孕的
<4-7,Penny>I'm the one who blabbed she was pregnant!

124
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,740
<4-9,Penny>-什么  -我不是故意的
<4-9,Penny>- What?! - I didn't mean to.

125
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,570
<4-9,Penny>就有天不小心跟她的助手说溜嘴了
<4-9,Penny>It just slipped out in front of her assistant one day.

126
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,860
<4-10,Bernadette>忘了拿外套
<4-10,Bernadette>I... I forgot my coat.

127
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,090
<4-11,Penny>来  亲爱的  外套拿去
<4-11,Penny>Oh! Here's your coat, honey.

128
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,030
<4-11,Penny>这外套太萌了
<4-11,Penny>That's such a cute jacket.

129
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,890
<4-11,Penny>天啊  我好内疚  我又骗了她
<4-11,Penny>God, I feel so bad-- I just lied to her.

130
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,450
<4-12,Amy>但你演技入木三分
<4-12,Amy>Oh, but you did it so well.

131
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,090
<4-12,Amy>真是太厉害了
<4-12,Amy>That's amazing!

132
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,780
<4-12,Amy>感觉像在看一个雕塑大师
<4-12,Amy>It's like watching a sculptor,

133
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,310
<4-12,Amy>但你用的材料是谎言
<4-12,Amy>but your clay was lies.

134
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,130
<4-13,Penny>现在的重点难道该是挖苦我吗
<4-13,Penny>Is that really what's important right now?

135
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,550
<4-14,Amy>我是说认真的  你得让我扫描你大脑
<4-14,Amy>I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain

136
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,760
<4-14,Amy>看看你撒谎时哪些区域会亮起
<4-14,Amy>when you're being dishonest so I can see what lights up.

137
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,600
<4-15,Penny>你这席话我受益良多
<4-15,Penny>That's super helpful, Amy.

138
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,700
<4-15,Penny>谢谢你全家啊  真想立刻让你扫描
<4-15,Penny>Thanks a lot. I can't wait to do that.

139
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,880
<4-16,Amy>我从这里就能看到一团臭三八细胞亮起
<4-16,Amy>I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin' up from here.

140
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,440
<5-1,Howard>等我一会  我打给我律师亲戚
<5-1,Howard>Give me a second to call my cousin.

141
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,550
<5-2,Sheldon>我想不出远在佛州劳德代尔堡的税务律师
<5-2,Sheldon>I don't see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale

142
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,980
<5-2,Sheldon>怎么能对知识财产权方面提出有用建议
<5-2,Sheldon>could be helpful regarding intellectual property.

143
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,010
<5-3,Howard>首先  他是在佛州的博卡拉顿
<5-3,Howard>First of all, he's in Boca Raton,

144
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,280
<5-3,Howard>那里比劳德代尔堡上档次多了
<5-3,Howard>which is better than Fort Lauderdale.

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,250
<5-3,Howard>更重要的是
<5-3,Howard>But more importantly,

146
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,230
<5-3,Howard>他上益智游戏节目撑了两天没被淘汰
<5-3,Howard>he lasted two days on Jeopardy,

147
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,340
<5-3,Howard>很明显他就是个聪明人
<5-3,Howard>so he's clearly a smart guy.

148
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,400
<5-4,Howard’s cousin (on skype)>你好
<5-4,Howard’s cousin (on skype)>Hello.

<5-6,Marty>Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do

152
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,000
<5-6,Marty>我妈都会对我感到失望
<5-6,Marty>my mom will be disappointed in me.

153
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,790
<5-7,Howard>但我没娶信犹太教的老婆  也算扯平了
<5-7,Howard>Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we're even.

154
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,120
<5-7,Howard>这位是莱纳德  这位是谢尔顿
<5-7,Howard>Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon.

155
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,070
<5-7,Howard>我们三个一起想出了这个导向系统
<5-7,Howard>The three of us came up with the guidance system.

<5-11,Raj>专利跟我无关  我在这里
<5-11,Raj>Oh, I'm not on the patent. I'm just here

159
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,720
<5-11,Raj>是因为我办公室里有只大黄蜂
<5-11,Raj>because there's a bumblebee in my office.

160
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,660
<5-12,Leonard>我有看到  真的很大只
<5-12,Leonard>I saw it. It's big.

<5-13,Howard>Do you have any advice for us?

164
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,220
<5-14,Marty>我对专利法了解不多
<5-14,Marty>Well, I don't know much about patent law.

165
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,980
<5-14,Marty>但我的建议是
<5-14,Marty>But, uh, my advice is:

166
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,620
<5-14,Marty>听听他们怎么说  有关信息尽量少说
<5-14,Marty>hear them out, offer as little information as possible,

167
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,120
<5-14,Marty>无论如何  绝对别签任何东西

168
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,900
<5-15,Sheldon>"别签任何东西"  这就是你的建议吗
<5-15,Sheldon>"Don't sign anything"? That's your advice?

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,990
<5-15,Sheldon>好吧  所以如果在会面中
<5-15,Sheldon>Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting,

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,020
<5-15,Sheldon>我们其中一个人画了一幅油画之类的
<5-15,Sheldon>one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting,

171
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,020
<5-15,Sheldon>你是在建议我们不要在上面签上名吗
<5-15,Sheldon>you'd recommend that we leave that unsigned?

172
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,890
<5-16,Marty>我不是这个意思
<5-16,Marty>That's not what I meant.

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,920
<5-17,Sheldon>你话就是这么说的
<5-17,Sheldon>That's what you said.

174
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,390
<5-16,Marty>但我不是这个意思

175
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,970
<5-19,Sheldon>你就在博卡拉顿这么当律师的吗
<5-19,Sheldon>This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton,

176
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,210
<5-19,Sheldon>说着词不达意
<5-19,Sheldon>by saying things you don't mean

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,940
<5-19,Sheldon>言不由衷的话
<5-19,Sheldon>and meaning things you don't say.

178
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,440
<5-20,Marty>霍华德  他为啥要对我嚷嚷
<5-20,Marty>Howard, why is he yelling at me?

179
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,310
<5-21,Sheldon>好吧  你上过益智节目
<5-21,Sheldon>All right, you were on Jeopardy.

180
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,870
<5-21,Sheldon>让我学学主持人
<5-21,Sheldon>Allow me to Alex Trebek

181
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,520
<5-21,Sheldon>并把这件事用节目上的问题形式表达
<5-21,Sheldon>this and put it in the form of a question:

182
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,000
<5-21,Sheldon>在座是哪个垃圾  在浪费我们的时间呢
<5-21,Sheldon>Who has been a complete waste of our time?

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,110
<5-23,Leonard>我会打给你
<5-23,Leonard>you'll be hearing from me.

<6-2,Bernadette>-我来啦  -你怎么来了
<6-2,Bernadette>- Hi. - Hey. What brings you by?

188
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,850
<6-3,Penny>去参加我们新款安眠药的销售研讨会了
<6-3,Penny>Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.

189
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,470
<6-4,Bernadette>-研讨会如何  -很棒啊
<6-4,Bernadette>- Oh. How was it? - Great.

190
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,920
<6-7,Penny>-睡着了吗  -开场两分钟就睡着了吧
<6-7,Penny>- Fell asleep? - In, like, two minutes. Yeah.

191
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,620
<6-7,Penny>一切情况还好吗
<6-7,Penny>So, how is everything going around here?

192
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,220
<6-7,Penny>还在为大家发现你怀孕这事不开心吗
<6-7,Penny>Are you still upset about people finding out you're pregnant?

193
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,360
<6-8,Bernadette>我真要气炸了
<6-8,Bernadette>I'm furious.

194
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,040
<6-9,Penny>当然  肯定的
<6-9,Penny>Sure, sure.

195
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,350
<6-9,Penny>你查清楚是谁说出去的吗
<6-9,Penny>Uh, did you ever figure out who told?

196
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,010
<6-10,Bernadette>没  我去找芭芭拉·陈对质了  但她说
<6-10,Bernadette>No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed

197
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,950
<6-10,Bernadette>她完全不知道我在说什么
<6-10,Bernadette>she didn't know what I was talking about.

198
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,570
<6-11,Penny>看来这事只能是未知的谜团了
<6-11,Penny>Well, I guess it's just gonna remain a mystery,

199
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,870
<6-11,Penny>就像研讨会把灯调暗后发生的事
<6-11,Penny>you know, like whatever happened in that seminar

200
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,890
<6-11,Penny>对我也是未知的谜团
<6-11,Penny>after they dimmed the lights.

201
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,340
<6-12,Bernadette>绝对是芭芭拉
<6-12,Bernadette>It had to be Barbara.

202
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,200
<6-12,Bernadette>我刚就一直在想办法报复她
<6-12,Bernadette>I've been trying to figure out a way to get back at her.

203
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,350
<6-12,Bernadette>你觉得用她工作用的电脑上网搜
<6-12,Bernadette>Do you think using her work computer to Google

204
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,290
<6-12,Bernadette>"怎么下海当鸡"会太过分吗
<6-12,Bernadette>"How to be a prostitute" is over the line?

205
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,250
<6-13,Penny>其实呢  在我高中的时候
<6-13,Penny>Uh, you know, when I was in high school,

206
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,150
<6-13,Penny>有个姑娘在我背后说我坏话
<6-13,Penny>there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back,

207
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,230
<6-13,Penny>所以我跟我朋友们
<6-13,Penny>so me and all my friends,

208
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,630
<6-13,Penny>把她围在厕所的角落  然后原谅了她
<6-13,Penny>we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.

209
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,630
<6-14,Bernadette>这算哪门子的报仇啊
<6-14,Bernadette>What kind of revenge is that?

210
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,990
<6-14,Bernadette>这臭娘们破坏我工作  我得整死她
<6-14,Bernadette>This woman screwed with my job. She's got to pay.

211
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,530
<6-15,Penny>好吧  亲爱的  其实呢
<6-15,Penny>Okay, all right, honey, you know what?

212
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,590
<6-15,Penny>我有一件昨天没胆跟你说的事
<6-15,Penny>There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday,

213
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,040
<6-15,Penny>而现在我还是怕得要死不敢告诉你  其实...
<6-15,Penny>a-and now... I'm just balls-out terrified to tell you, but...

214
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,330
<6-15,Penny>真相是...
<6-15,Penny>the truth is it...

215
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,660
<6-15,Penny>大嘴巴的不是芭芭拉  是我
<6-15,Penny>wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me.

216
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,700
<6-15,Penny>是我让大家都知道的
<6-15,Penny>I'm the reason everyone knows.

217
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,890
<6-16,Bernadette>你为什么要这么做
<6-16,Bernadette>Why did you do that?

218
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,350
<6-17,Penny>不小心说漏嘴嘛  很抱歉我撒谎了
<6-17,Penny>Well, it was an accident. I am so sorry I lied.

219
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,550
<6-18,Bernadette>出去
<6-18,Bernadette>Get out.

220
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,420
<6-19,Penny>对了  厕所女同学的事我也撒谎了
<6-19,Penny>Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom.

221
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,590
<6-19,Penny>是的  我们其实把她的牙套保持器扔进了马桶
<6-19,Penny>Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet

222
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,920
<6-19,Penny>然后又塞回她的嘴里
<6-19,Penny>and put it back in her mouth.

223
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,570
<7-1,Sheldon>我不懂为什么会面时我不能说话
<7-1,Sheldon>I don't understand why I can't talk at this meeting.

224
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,220
<7-2,Leonard>因为你一开口就会激怒别人
<7-2,Leonard>'Cause when you talk, it enrages people.

225
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,310
<7-2,Leonard>好吧
<7-2,Leonard>Okay.

<7-5,Sheldon>that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?

233
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,110
<7-6,Leonard>你正在激怒我
<7-6,Leonard>I'm getting enraged.

<7-11,Colonel Williams>I'm Colonel Williams.

240
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,340
<7-11,Colonel Williams>感谢抽空与我见面
<7-11,Colonel Williams>Thank you for meeting with me.

241
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,600
<7-13,Howard>-你好  -你好
<7-13,Howard>- Hi. - Hello.

242
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,880
<7-14,Colonel Williams>你们中的哪一位是这个项目的主要设计者
<7-14,Colonel Williams>So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?

243
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,670
<7-15,Howard>这是大家共同努力的结果
<7-15,Howard>It's a group effort,

244
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,000
<7-15,Howard>但如果非得选一个主力  那应该是我吧
<7-15,Howard>but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.

245
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,700
<8-1,Colonel Williams>因为量子涡旋
<8-1,Colonel Williams>And because of the quantum vortices,

246
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,900
<8-1,Colonel Williams>这玩意就具有永动性吗
<8-1,Colonel Williams>this can run perpetually?

247
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,890
<8-2,Leonard>完全正确
<8-2,Leonard>Exactly.

248
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,930
<8-2,Leonard>看来你很懂物理嘛
<8-2,Leonard>Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.

249
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,470
<8-3,Colonel Williams>-我是被培训出来的科学家  -是吗
<8-3,Colonel Williams>- Well, I'm a scientist by training. - Really?

250
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,430
<8-4,Howard>你是物理学家吗
<8-4,Howard>You're a physicist?

251
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,770
<8-5,Colonel Williams>比那强  我是工程师
<8-5,Colonel Williams>Better. I'm an engineer.

252
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,020
<8-6,Leonard>你是哪里毕业的
<8-6,Leonard>Where did you go to school?

253
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,050
<8-7,Colonel Williams>麻省理工
<8-7,Colonel Williams>MIT.

254
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,900
<8-8,Howard>真巧  我也是
<8-8,Howard>Oh. Well, hey, me, too.

255
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,680
<8-6,Leonard>我早该知道
<8-6,Leonard>I should have known.

256
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,880
<8-7,Colonel Williams>每一项伟大的发明背后都有我们校友的智慧结晶
<8-7,Colonel Williams>Behind every great invention is an MIT mind.

257
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,060
<8-7,Colonel Williams>我就不兜圈子了
<8-7,Colonel Williams>I'll cut to the chase.

258
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,530
<8-7,Colonel Williams>美国空军想将这项技术投入到实际应用中
<8-7,Colonel Williams>The Air Force believes there's an application for this technology,

259
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,510
<8-7,Colonel Williams>我们有兴趣投资你们的研究
<8-7,Colonel Williams>and we're interested in funding your research.

260
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,470
<9-1,Howard>多谢赏识  但你要知道
<9-1,Howard>Well, thanks, but you should know

261
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,200
<9-1,Howard>我们有点担心这项技术会被用到武器上
<9-1,Howard>we're a little concerned about this being used in weapons.

262
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,320
<9-2,Colonel Williams>这样啊  让我来放宽你心
<9-2,Colonel Williams>Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease.

263
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,410
<9-2,Colonel Williams>我们拿来干什么关你们屁事
<9-2,Colonel Williams>What we use it for is none of your business.

264
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,500
<9-3,Leonard>我不知道该对此作何感想
<9-3,Leonard>I don't know how I feel about this.

265
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,640
<9-4,Colonel Williams>伙计们  这只是一个导向系统
<9-4,Colonel Williams>Look, guys, it's just a guidance system.

266
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,300
<9-4,Colonel Williams>别想得好像你们交给我们的是
<9-4,Colonel Williams>It's not like you're handing us

267
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,820
<9-4,Colonel Williams>《星际迷航》的终极武器死星
<9-4,Colonel Williams>the Death Star from Star Trek.

268
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,540
<9-4,Colonel Williams>你们唯一需要顾虑的是
<9-4,Colonel Williams>All you need to worry about is,

269
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,910
<9-4,Colonel Williams>现在它这么大
<9-4,Colonel Williams>right now, it's this big,

270
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,730
<9-4,Colonel Williams>我们需要它变得...这么点大
<9-4,Colonel Williams>and we need it to be... this big.

271
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,680
<9-5,Leonard>那要大大减小很多啊
<9-5,Leonard>That's a lot less big.

272
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,920
<9-6,Colonel Williams>没错  减小的程度有这么大
<9-6,Colonel Williams>Yes, it's... this much less big.

273
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,640
<9-7,Howard>我都不确定可不可行
<9-7,Howard>I'm not even sure that's possible.

274
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,630
<9-8,Colonel Williams>我问过几个麻省理工的同事
<9-8,Colonel Williams>Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT,

275
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,240
<9-8,Colonel Williams>他们认为四个月就能搞定
<9-8,Colonel Williams>and they thought they could get it done in four months.

276
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,200
<9-9,Howard>-四个月  -那我们两个月就能搞定
<9-9,Howard>- Four months? - Yeah, we'll do it in two!

277
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,160
<9-10,Sheldon>你好  我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
<9-10,Sheldon>Hi. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

278
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,410
<9-10,Sheldon>我才是这个项目的主力设计者
<9-10,Sheldon>I'm the actual brains behind this project.

279
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,480
<9-10,Sheldon>还有工程师不是真正的科学家
<9-10,Sheldon>Also, engineers aren't real scientists,

280
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,910
<9-10,Sheldon>麻省理工是一所职业学院
<9-10,Sheldon>MIT's a trade school,

281
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,530
<9-10,Sheldon>还有还有  死星来自《星球大战》不是《星际迷航》
<9-10,Sheldon>and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek!

282
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,150
<9-10,Sheldon>撇开那些不说
<9-10,Sheldon>But otherwise,

283
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,460
<9-10,Sheldon>感谢为国服役
<9-10,Sheldon>thank you for your service.

284
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,120
<10-1,Amy>霍华德跟我说你要加班  所以我带了吃的来
<10-1,Amy>Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.

285
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,620
<10-2,Bernadette>谢谢  我只是想安静地工作
<10-2,Bernadette>Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done

286
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,550
<10-2,Bernadette>不用每五分钟就有人跑来恭喜我怀孕了
<10-2,Bernadette>without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.

287
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,010
<10-3,Amy>我今天自己在实验室
<10-3,Amy>I spent my day alone in the lab

288
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,700
<10-3,Amy>陪一只炭疽感染的老鼠等死
<10-3,Amy>waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.

289
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,560
<10-4,Bernadette>你是来给我送吃的  还是来幸灾乐祸
<10-4,Bernadette>Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?

290
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,620
<10-5,Amy>我是来看看你心情好点没
<10-5,Amy>Well, I came to see how you were feeling,

291
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,140
<10-5,Amy>但我猜还在生气呢
<10-5,Amy>but I'm guessing still angry?

292
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,050
<10-5,Amy>抱歉
<10-5,Amy>I'm sorry.

293
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,730
<10-6,Bernadette>我老板要见我  我现在压力山大
<10-6,Bernadette>My boss wants to meet with me, and I'm stressing.

294
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,150
<10-7,Amy>你真的认为他们会开始区别对待你吗
<10-7,Amy>You really think they're gonna start treating you differently?

295
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,350
<10-7,Amy>开什么玩笑
<10-7,Amy>Are you kidding?

296
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,420
<10-8,Bernadette>我向来都被人区别对待
<10-8,Bernadette>I've always been treated differently!

297
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,670
<10-8,Bernadette>瞧我小体型  听我的小尖嗓
<10-8,Bernadette>Look at me! Listen to me!

298
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,060
<10-8,Bernadette>你看见我脑子里永远不会首先想到
<10-8,Bernadette>I mean, the first thought when you see me isn't,

299
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,320
<10-8,Bernadette>"那是一位科学家"
<10-8,Bernadette>"That's a scientist."

300
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,820
<10-8,Bernadette>你只会想"希望她不要跟妈妈走丢"
<10-8,Bernadette>It's, "I wonder if her mommy knows where she is."

301
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,830
<10-9,Amy>我好后悔给你买了欢乐儿童餐
<10-9,Amy>I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.

302
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,250
<10-10,Bernadette>我那么努力工作才坐上这个位置
<10-10,Bernadette>I've worked so hard to get where I am,

303
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,290
<10-10,Bernadette>我不想因为怀孕
<10-10,Bernadette>and I don't want to get sent back to square one

304
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,150
<10-10,Bernadette>就被打回原点
<10-10,Bernadette>because I'm pregnant.

305
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,070
<10-11,Amy>我懂你的感受
<10-11,Amy>I understand how you feel.

306
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,540
<10-12,Bernadette>谢谢
<10-12,Bernadette>Thank you.

307
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,060
<10-13,Amy>真希望我能做些什么让你好过点
<10-13,Amy>I wish there were some way I could make it better.

308
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,120
<10-14,Bernadette>你给我买了薯条  这是好的第一步
<10-14,Bernadette>Well, you brought me French fries. That's a start.

309
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,370
<10-15,Amy>其实我给你买了切片苹果  因为你怀孕了嘛
<10-15,Amy>Uh, actually, I got you apple slices 'cause you're pregnant.

310
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,330
<10-15,Amy>切片苹果
<10-15,Amy>Apple slices?

311
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,600
<10-16,Bernadette>哪个傻逼会去麦当劳买水果啊
<10-16,Bernadette>What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald's and gets fruit?!

312
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,710
<10-17,Amy>小的立马重新买
<10-17,Amy>I'll be right back.

313
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,770
<10-18,Bernadette>老娘还要巧克力奶昔
<10-18,Bernadette>And a chocolate shake!

314
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,920
<11-3,Penny>你做什么呢
<11-3,Penny>What are you doing?

315
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,710
<11-4,Sheldon>莱纳德生我气了  我给他做柠檬方块呢
<11-4,Sheldon>Oh, Leonard's mad at me, so I'm making him lemon bars.

316
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,560
<11-5,Penny>他爱吃柠檬方块吗
<11-5,Penny>Does he even like lemon bars?

317
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,400
<11-6,Sheldon>不爱吃
<11-6,Sheldon>Not really.

318
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,280
<11-6,Sheldon>但我也在生他的气  所以就柠檬方块吧
<11-6,Sheldon>But I'm mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.

319
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,750
<11-7,Penny>会面时发生什么事了吗
<11-7,Penny>Something happen at the meeting?

320
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,120
<11-8,Sheldon>他们逼我保证不说话
<11-8,Sheldon>They made me promise I wouldn't talk.

321
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,820
<11-9,Penny>-结果你说话了  -你看吧
<11-9,Penny>- And you talked? - Well, now, see?

322
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,970
<11-10,Sheldon>你都知道会发生什么事了
<11-10,Sheldon>You knew what was gonna happen.

323
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,550
<11-10,Sheldon>他们怎么就不知道呢
<11-10,Sheldon>Why didn't they?

324
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,200
<11-10,Sheldon>总之现在我们承诺了要在极短的时间内
<11-10,Sheldon>Anyway, now we're committed to completing this project

325
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,890
<11-10,Sheldon>完成这个项目
<11-10,Sheldon>in a ridiculously short time frame,

326
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,990
<11-10,Sheldon>大家都生我气了
<11-10,Sheldon>and everyone's upset with me.

327
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,280
<11-11,Penny>也许这能让你好过点
<11-11,Penny>Well, if it makes you feel any better,

328
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,610
<11-11,Penny>伯纳黛特也在生我的气
<11-11,Penny>Bernadette's mad at me, too.

329
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,570
<11-11,Penny>也许这能让你好过点
<11-11,Penny>If it makes you feel any better,

330
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,520
<11-12,Sheldon>有一种类型的寄生蜂
<11-12,Sheldon>a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus

331
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,420
<11-12,Sheldon>在被认定灭绝101年后重新被发现踪迹了
<11-12,Sheldon>has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.

332
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,310
<11-13,Penny>这怎么让我好过了
<11-13,Penny>Why would that make me feel better?

333
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,820
<11-14,Sheldon>那你跟伯纳黛特的事又怎么会让我好过
<11-14,Sheldon>Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better?

334
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,740
<11-14,Sheldon>至少我的还有教育意义
<11-14,Sheldon>At least mine was educational.

335
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,330
<11-15,Penny>好吧  当我没说
<11-15,Penny>Okay. Never mind.

336
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,990
<11-16,Sheldon>对不起
<11-16,Sheldon>Look, I'm sorry.

337
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,150
<11-16,Sheldon>告诉我伯纳黛特为什么生你的气了
<11-16,Sheldon>Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.

338
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,460
<11-17,Penny>我跟公司的人说了她怀孕的事
<11-17,Penny>Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant.

339
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,660
<11-17,Penny>但她没准备让他们知道
<11-17,Penny>She wasn't ready for them to know.

340
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,680
<11-18,Sheldon>你为什么要这么做
<11-18,Sheldon>Why would you do that?

341
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,870
<11-19,Penny>我就是说溜嘴了  我也很懊悔
<11-19,Penny>Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.

342
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,030
<11-20,Sheldon>跟我简直一模一样
<11-20,Sheldon>See, that's exactly what happened to me,

343
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,320
<11-20,Sheldon>除了我是故意说的  而且并不后悔
<11-20,Sheldon>except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.

344
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,980
<12-1,Raj>两个月内完成有可能吗
<12-1,Raj>Is it even possible to get this done in two months?

345
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,130
<12-2,Howard>也许吧  不知道
<12-2,Howard>Well, maybe. I don't know.

346
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,770
<12-2,Howard>我们得每周不歇地一天工作12小时
<12-2,Howard>We'll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.

347
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,190
<12-3,Leonard>也就是说我不能再每天给佩妮做早餐了
<12-3,Leonard>Which means I won't be able to make Penny breakfast every day,

348
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,120
<12-3,Leonard>她会意识我做的法式吐司奶油卷
<12-3,Leonard>and she'll realize my brioche French toast

349
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,700
<12-3,Leonard>是唯一让她不跟我离婚的原因
<12-3,Leonard>was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.

350
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,740
<12-4,Howard>我也爱吃你做的法式吐司
<12-4,Howard>I love your French toast.

351
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,210
<12-5,Leonard>谢了  兄弟
<12-5,Leonard>Oh, thanks, man.

352
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,090
<12-6,Raj>那你们为什么同意那个截止日期
<12-6,Raj>So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?

353
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,730
<12-7,Howard>我们没同意  谢尔顿干的
<12-7,Howard>We didn't. Sheldon did.

354
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,650
<12-8,Raj>你就让他答应了
<12-8,Raj>And you just let him?

355
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,300
<12-9,Leonard>上校还说这是苟利国家的事
<12-9,Leonard>Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country,

356
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,840
<12-9,Leonard>我们就因资金而趋之了
<12-9,Leonard>and the funding is substantial.

357
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,520
<12-10,Howard>没有  主要当时有一阵尴尬的沉默
<12-10,Howard>No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause,

358
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,780
<12-10,Howard>于是为了打破尴尬局面  我就说了"好"
<12-10,Howard>and I broke it by saying, "Okay."

359
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,820
<12-11,Raj>看来我要见不到你们一阵子了
<12-11,Raj>So I guess I won't be seeing you guys for a while.

360
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,270
<12-12,Leonard>是这样的
<12-12,Leonard>Oh, looks like it. Wow.

361
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,890
<12-13,Raj>你们去军方工作  独留我一人
<12-13,Raj>You're going off to work with the military, leaving me behind.

362
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,340
<12-13,Raj>我突然理解军嫂的生活了
<12-13,Raj>Now I know how all those army wives feel.

363
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,390
<12-14,Howard>你够了啊
<12-14,Howard>Would you stop?

364
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,210
<12-14,Howard>我们就是在大学另一端而已
<12-14,Howard>We're just gonna be on the other side of campus.

365
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,830
<12-15,Raj>也在这里
<12-15,Raj>And right here.

366
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,280
<12-16,Howard>你就是一傻姑娘
<12-16,Howard>You are a deeply silly man.

367
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,030
<12-17,Raj>他怎么如此不敢直面内心呢
<12-17,Raj>He is so afraid of his feelings.

368
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,950
<13-2,Bernadette>有空吗
<13-2,Bernadette>Got a minute?

369
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,110
<13-3,Penny>有啊  进来
<13-3,Penny>Yeah, come on in.

370
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,990
<13-4,Bernadette>我想道歉
<13-4,Bernadette>I just wanted to apologize.

371
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,150
<13-4,Bernadette>我知道你是不小心说出去的
<13-4,Bernadette>I know what you did was an accident.

372
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,370
<13-5,Penny>谢谢你  对不起  我跟你撒谎了
<13-5,Penny>Oh, thank you, and I'm sorry I lied about it.

373
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,390
<13-6,Bernadette>不过  你撒谎挺在行的
<13-6,Bernadette>For what it's worth, you're a great liar.

374
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,220
<13-7,Penny>艾米也这么夸我的
<13-7,Penny>Oh, that's what Amy said.

375
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,870
<13-7,Penny>研究项目怎么样了
<13-7,Penny>So what's going on with the research project?

376
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,400
<13-7,Penny>他们还会让你负责吗
<13-7,Penny>Are they gonna let you run it?

377
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,390
<13-8,Bernadette>老板说他还没定下来
<13-8,Bernadette>Well, my boss said he hadn't decided yet,

378
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,710
<13-8,Bernadette>于是我温柔地提醒了他
<13-8,Bernadette>so I gently reminded him

379
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,370
<13-8,Bernadette>他是个有钱白人老头
<13-8,Bernadette>that he's an old rich white guy,

380
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,780
<13-8,Bernadette>而我是个甜美无害的小孕妇
<13-8,Bernadette>and I'm a sweet little pregnant lady

381
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,590
<13-8,Bernadette>在陪审团面前演落泪戏码  没在怕的
<13-8,Bernadette>who's not afraid to cry in front of a jury.

382
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,800
<13-9,Penny>你威胁要告他
<13-9,Penny>You threatened to sue?

383
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,610
<13-10,Bernadette>我多年前就已学会  当你只有一米五
<13-10,Bernadette>Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you're four feet eleven

384
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,490
<13-10,Bernadette>而平视只能看到每个男人裆部时
<13-10,Bernadette>and eye level with every guy's crotch,

385
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,750
<13-10,Bernadette>你就往那里捶就对了
<13-10,Bernadette>that's where you punch.

386
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,050
<13-11,Penny>有点意思
<13-11,Penny>That's funny.

387
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,560
<13-11,Penny>我学到的不是捶  是...
<13-11,Penny>I learned something totally different.

388
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,360
<13-12,Bernadette>其实呢
<13-12,Bernadette>Do you know what?

389
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,290
<13-12,Bernadette>不过是个研究项目
<13-12,Bernadette>It's just a research project.

390
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,750
<13-12,Bernadette>世上最重要的工作
<13-12,Bernadette>The most important job in the world

391
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,490
<13-12,Bernadette>应该是抚养这个孩子
<13-12,Bernadette>is gonna be raising this child.

392
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,450
<13-12,Bernadette>那才赋予我生命的意义
<13-12,Bernadette>It's all I need to give my life meaning.

393
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,670
<13-13,Penny>说得太好了
<13-13,Penny>Oh, that's so beautiful.

394
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,330
<13-14,Bernadette>你信了  那就好
<13-14,Bernadette>You believe me? Oh, good.

395
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,840
<13-14,Bernadette>再多11个像你这样的笨蛋
<13-14,Bernadette>11 more chumps like you,

396
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,090
<13-14,Bernadette>整团陪审团就随老娘摆布了
<13-14,Bernadette>I'll have the jury eating out of my hand.

397
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,700
<14-1,Sheldon>我之前都不知道这栋楼是机密建筑
<14-1,Sheldon>I never realized this building was classified.

398
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,830
<14-2,Howard>也许正是因为它是机密
<14-2,Howard>Maybe that's because it's classified.

399
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,920
<14-3,Leonard>希望不会离我们的车位太远
<14-3,Leonard>Wish we weren't so far from my parking space.

400
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,470
<14-4,Sheldon>就你吃柠檬方块的那个熊样
<14-4,Sheldon>The way you put away those lemon bars,

401
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,640
<14-4,Sheldon>远点是好事
<14-4,Sheldon>perhaps that's a good thing.

402
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,060
<14-5,Leonard>我希望恢复"你不许说话"规则
<14-5,Leonard>I'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.

403
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,140
<14-6,Sheldon>为什么  明显没用
<14-6,Sheldon>Why? It clearly doesn't work.

404
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,100
<14-6,Sheldon>危险
<14-6,Sheldon>不得吸烟

405
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,730
<14-7,Howard>应该就是这了
<14-7,Howard>I guess this is it.

406
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,650
<14-8,Leonard>那是视网膜扫描仪吗
