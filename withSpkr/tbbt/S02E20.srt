00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,660

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,100
<3-25,Howard>但我从正面看到的
<3-25,Howard>Yes, but I saw it from the front.

150
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,670
<3-26,Sheldon>这算什么伎俩
<3-26,Sheldon>A far less impressive feat.

151
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,770
<3-27,Howard>拜托
<3-27,Howard>Oh, come on!

<3-44,Penny>真不知道什么会了
<3-44,Penny>I don't know what will.

239
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,270
<5-11,Sheldon>老式这个词不足以形容我们的计划

<5-19,Leonard>好
<5-19,Leonard>Okay!

250
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,000
<5-20,Howard>我先进去把内裤脱了
<5-20,Howard>Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.

251
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,370
<5-21,Leonard>为什么
<5-21,Leonard>Why?

252
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,500
<5-22,Howard>如果今晚走运  我可不想被潜水侠内裤卡住
<5-22,Howard>Well, if I get lucky, I don't want to be caught in my aquaman briefs.

253
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,540
<6-1,Raj>来杯鸡尾酒  上面插把小雨伞
<6-1,Raj>May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?

254
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,840
<6-2,Howard>-不  不用了    -为什么
<6-2,Howard>- No, he may not. - why?

255
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,820
<6-4,Howard>我才不会和一个喝鸡尾酒
<6-4,Howard>I'm not sitting here with a guy

256
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,740
<6-4,Howard>还要插把雨伞的人坐一起
<6-4,Howard>Drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.

257
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,440
<6-4,Howard>好吧
<6-4,Howard>Fine.

258
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,340
<6-5,Raj>换巧克力马提尼
<6-5,Raj>I'll have a chocolate martini.

259
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,540
<6-6,Howard>又错了
<6-6,Howard>Wrong again!

260
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,950
<6-7,Raj>拜托 你知道我不醉得像
<6-7,Raj>Come on, you know I can't talk to women unless

261
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,480
<6-7,Raj>印度灯节里的灯那么旺就没法搭讪
<6-7,Raj>I'm lit up like the hindu festival of dewali.

262
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,340
<6-8,Howard>听着  洛城有很多酒吧
<6-8,Howard>Look, There are plenty of bars in los angeles

263
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,140
<6-8,Howard>可以让你点这些加巧克力的鸡尾酒和巧克力马丁尼
<6-8,Howard>where you can order grasshoppers and Chocolate martinis,

264
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,940
<6-8,Howard>但去那里已没必要点  因为没女人了
<6-8,Howard>but you wouldn't have to because there are no women in them.

265
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,110
<6-9,Raj>开窍了
<6-9,Raj>gotcha.

266
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,100
<6-9,Raj>我点杯白兰地亚历山大
<6-9,Raj>I'll have a brandy alexander.

267
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,780
<6-10,Howard>三剑客变成双飞侠了
<6-10,Howard>All right, the three musketeers just became the dynamic duo.

268
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,880
<6-11,Leonard>我们不去勾搭那些女的?
<6-11,Leonard>Should we talk to some of these women?

269
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,040
<6-12,Howard>不  现在还太早了
<6-12,Howard>No. it's way too early in the night for that.

270
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,210
<6-12,Howard>先让律师和运动员挑肥拣瘦  然后呢
<6-12,Howard>See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then...

271
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,010
<6-12,Howard>我们就直接上老弱病残的
<6-12,Howard>We go after the weak and the old and the lame.

272
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,540
<6-13,Leonard>这就是你的秘诀
<6-13,Leonard>That's your system?

273
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,110
<6-14,Howard>没错
<6-14,Howard>That's my system.

274
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,110
<6-14,Howard>如果看到有个带导盲犬的妞  她是我的
<6-14,Howard>Oh, and if you spot a chick with a seeing eye dog, she's mine.

275
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,900
<6-14,Howard>拜托
<6-14,Howard>Oh, come on.

276
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,110
<7-1,Penny>我感觉运动裤船长参加你的开幕式也无妨
<7-1,Penny>I think it's nice that captain sweatpants showed up to your art opening.

277
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,240
<7-2,Stuart>如果他没碰所有奶酪的话更好
<7-2,Stuart>Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese.

278
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,880
<7-3,Penny>时间还早
<7-3,Penny>You know, it's kind of early.

279
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,980
<7-3,Penny>你想喝点咖啡什么的吗
<7-3,Penny>Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?

280
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,340
<7-4,Stuart>好像咖啡晚了点啊
<7-4,Stuart>Oh, gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?

281
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,440
<7-5,Penny>你以为喝咖啡只是喝咖啡呢
<7-5,Penny>Oh, you think "coffee," means coffee.

282
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,910
<7-5,Penny>太纯洁了
<7-5,Penny>That is so sweet.

283
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,040
<7-5,Penny>来吧  我有脱咖啡因的
<7-5,Penny>Come on. I think I have decaf.

284
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,810
<7-6,Sheldon>太好了  史都华
<7-6,Sheldon>Oh, good. stuart.

285
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,180
<7-6,Sheldon>我听到你在说话
<7-6,Sheldon>I thought I heard your voice.

286
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,810
<7-6,Sheldon>你有空吗
<7-6,Sheldon>Do you have a moment?

287
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,980
<7-7,Stuart>大概吧
<7-7,Stuart>Uh, yeah, I guess.

288
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,480
<7-8,Penny>谢尔顿   我们有点忙
<7-8,Penny>Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so...

289
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,410
<7-9,Sheldon>你们干啥呢
<7-9,Sheldon>What are you doing?

290
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,610
<7-10,Stuart>我们要喝咖啡
<7-10,Stuart>We're having coffee.

291
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,910
<7-11,Sheldon>现在喝咖啡太晚了吧
<7-11,Sheldon>Well, isn't it a little late for coffee?

292
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,910
<7-12,Stuart>没事  她有脱咖啡因的
<7-12,Stuart>It's okay. she thinks she has decaf.

293
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,110
<7-13,Penny>我去找找
<7-13,Penny>I'll just go look for it.

294
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,540
<7-14,Stuart>怎么了
<7-14,Stuart>What's up?

295
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,380
<7-15,Sheldon>我刚才三小时都在网上蝙蝠侠
<7-15,Sheldon>Well,  I've spent the last three hours in an online debate

296
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,210
<7-15,Sheldon>坛子上辩论  想找你帮忙
<7-15,Sheldon>In the dc comics batman chatroom, and I need your help.

297
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,580
<7-16,Stuart>那些小子很顽固的
<7-16,Stuart>Oh, yeah. those guys can be very stubborn.

298
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,740
<7-16,Stuart>什么话题
<7-16,Stuart>What's the topic?

299
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,270
<7-17,Sheldon>我觉得如果蝙蝠侠的死是永久的
<7-17,Sheldon>I am asserting, in the event that batman's death proves permanent,

300
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,020
<7-17,Sheldon>那么第一任罗宾  迪克·格雷森
<7-17,Sheldon>The original robin, dick grayson,

301
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,380
<7-17,Sheldon>是他最合逻辑的继任人
<7-17,Sheldon>Is the logical successor to the bat cowl.

302
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,940
<7-18,Stuart>谢尔顿   恐怕你错得太离谱了
<7-18,Stuart>Ooh. sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.

303
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,080
<7-19,Sheldon>什么
<7-19,Sheldon>More wrong?

304
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,340
<7-19,Sheldon>错是绝对化的  没有比较级的
<7-19,Sheldon>Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.

305
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,740
<7-20,Stuart>当然有
<7-20,Stuart>Of course it is.

306
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,940
<7-20,Stuart>说番茄是蔬菜是小错
<7-20,Stuart>It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable.

307
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,610
<7-20,Stuart>说番茄是悬索桥是大错特错
<7-20,Stuart>It's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge.

308
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,690
<7-20,Stuart>话说回来   迪克后来成了黑翼侠
<7-20,Stuart>But returning to the original issue, dick grayson became nightwing,

309
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,580
<7-20,Stuart>单独成英雄了
<7-20,Stuart>A superhero in his own right.

310
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,440
<7-20,Stuart>蝙蝠侠二代肯定是第二任罗宾  杰森·托特
<7-20,Stuart>Batman 2 has to be the second robin, jason todd.

311
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,910
<7-21,Sheldon>肯定  肯定
<7-21,Sheldon>Has to be? has to be?

312
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,980
<7-21,Sheldon>我看你是故意挑衅
<7-21,Sheldon>I hope you're being deliberately provocative.

313
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,510
<7-22,Penny>我找到了
<7-22,Penny>I found the decaf!

314
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,640
<7-23,Stuart>太好了
<7-23,Stuart>Oh, great!

315
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,040
<7-24,Sheldon>给我一杯凉茶
<7-24,Sheldon>Herbal tea for me, please.

316
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,570
<8-1,Raj>酒保 来杯亚历山大鸡尾酒
<8-1,Raj>Barkeep! Alexander me.

317
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,450
<8-2,Leonard>那边两个怎么样
<8-2,Leonard>How about those two?

318
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,430
<8-3,Howard>不行 她们在吃花生呢
<8-3,Howard>No... They're eating peanuts.

319
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,440
<8-3,Howard>我又过敏  亲个嘴估计就得在西奈医院呆一周
<8-3,Howard>And my allergies, one kiss would put me in cedars-sinai for a week.

320
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,980
<8-4,Leonard>角落里的那个呢
<8-4,Leonard>What about the ones in the corner?

321
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,350
<8-5,Howard>有希望  很有希望
<8-5,Howard>Possible. very possible.

322
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,320
<8-5,Howard>你是想要那个戴颈圈的呢
<8-5,Howard>Do you want the one in the whiplash collar

323
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,920
<8-5,Howard>还是老眨眼睛的那个呢
<8-5,Howard>or the one who keeps blinking?

324
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,750
<8-6,Leonard>我觉得眨眼睛的比较可爱
<8-6,Leonard>I think blinky's cute.

325
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,520
<8-7,Howard>行  就这样
<8-7,Howard>You got it, sir.

326
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,250
<8-8,Leonard>等等  我们就这样过去
<8-8,Leonard>Wait, so we just go over there?

327
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,420
<8-8,Leonard>别急
<8-8,Leonard>No.

328
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,380
<8-9,Howard>我们不打无准备之仗
<8-9,Howard>We have a little prep work to do.

329
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,320
<8-9,Howard>把这个放进嘴里
<8-9,Howard>Put this in your mouth.

330
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,850
<8-9,Howard>我们经过她们身边  你打个趔趄
<8-9,Howard>We walk past them, you stumble a bit.

331
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,150
<8-9,Howard>我就说  抱歉  我朋友呢...
<8-9,Howard>I say, sorry, my friend's had a little too much.

332
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,980
<8-9,Howard>然后从你嘴里拉这个出来
<8-9,Howard>And then I start to pull it out of your mouth.

333
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,050
<8-9,Howard>然后说  他吃饱了撑的
<8-9,Howard>And say, "a little too much fun."

334
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,880
<8-9,Howard>懂了没
<8-9,Howard>Get it?

335
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,880
<8-9,Howard>她们会笑  我们也很开心
<8-9,Howard>I mean, they're laughing. we're laughing.

336
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,890
<8-9,Howard>接下来我们把姑娘们灌到
<8-9,Howard>Then we get them up to about a .

337
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,780
<8-9,Howard>血液中酒精浓度等级为15的时候
<8-9,Howard>15 blood alcohol level,

338
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,380
<8-9,Howard>告诉她们咱是大款
<8-9,Howard>and tell them we're millionaires.

339
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,120
<8-10,Leonard>还有没有别的
<8-10,Leonard>What else you got?

340
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,450
<8-10,Leonard>看情况了
<8-10,Leonard>Depends.

341
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,380
<8-11,Howard>你愿意坐我腿上  装做表演口技的傻子吗
<8-11,Howard>Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?

342
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,250
<8-12,Leonard>不愿意
<8-12,Leonard>No.

343
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,280
<8-13,Howard>我不能坐你腿上  你不懂规则
<8-13,Howard>I can't sit on your lap. you don't know the routine.

344
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,750
<9-1,Stuart>抱歉  但你明显局限在前零点时期的DC宇宙了
<9-1,Stuart>I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck in a pre-zero hour dc universe.

345
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,080
<9-2,Sheldon>当然了
<9-2,Sheldon>Of course I am.

346
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,290
<9-2,Sheldon>去掉杀害蝙蝠侠父母的杀手乔·齐尔
<9-2,Sheldon>Removing joe chill as the killer of batman's

347
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,980
<9-2,Sheldon>明显剥夺了这个角色存在的理由
<9-2,Sheldon>Parents effectively deprived him of his raison d'etre.

348
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,270
<9-2,Sheldon>好吧
<9-2,Sheldon>Okay.

349
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,380
<9-3,Stuart>你可以随便秀法语  但不能证明你是对的
<9-3,Stuart>You can throw all the french around you want, it doesn't make you right.

350
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,780
<9-4,Sheldon>[法语]正好相反
<9-4,Sheldon>Au contraire.

351
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,100
<9-5,Stuart>另外
<9-5,Stuart>Plus,

352
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,770
<9-5,Stuart>你忘了《无限危机》的故事情节
<9-5,Stuart>You're forgetting that the infinite crisis

353
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,220
<9-5,Stuart>又将乔·齐尔囊括进《蝙蝠侠传奇》中了
<9-5,Stuart>Storyline restored joe chill to the batman mythology.

354
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,750
<9-6,Sheldon>我什么都没忘  而且我很厌恶你的语气
<9-6,Sheldon>I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.

355
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,250
<9-6,Sheldon>行
<9-6,Sheldon>Okay.

356

<9-7,Stuart>谢尔顿  现在很晚了 我得去睡会儿
<9-7,Stuart>Look, sheldon, it's late. I've got to get some sleep.

357
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,280
<9-8,Sheldon>那么 我赢了
<9-8,Sheldon>So, I win.

358
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,580
<9-9,Stuart>没门  我是累了要休息

378
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,820
<10-7,Howard>我是只猎鹰  单飞时收获更好
<10-7,Howard>I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.

379
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,820
<10-8,Leonard>行  我坐着  你去翱翔捕猎吧
