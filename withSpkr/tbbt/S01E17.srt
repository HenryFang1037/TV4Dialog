<2-5,Leonard>她不想说话
<2-5,Leonard>She doesn't want to talk.

42
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,810
<2-6,Sheldon>没什么惊讶的  潘妮的情感来自于

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,990
<2-6,Sheldon>"无话可说"的概念

49
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,250
<2-6,Sheldon>或者她就是不想说话
<2-6,Sheldon>Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk.

<2-11,Howard>很显然  他把他们私人生活的细节放在了
<2-11,Howard>Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,850
<2-11,Howard>他的博客上  可我却怎么都找不到
<2-11,Howard>On his blog which I cannot find anywhere.

<2-13,Howard>And if the moment feels right,

60
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,140
<2-13,Howard>看看可不可以趁虚而入
<2-13,Howard>See if you can cop a feel.

61

<2-14,Leonard>我才不会趁人之危  霍华德
<2-14,Leonard>I'm not going to do that, howard.

62
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,790
<2-15,Sheldon>我倒完全没意识到现在
<2-15,Sheldon>I'm not aware of a new social

63
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,140
<2-15,Sheldon>有什么要求你进行干预和调解的社交习俗
<2-15,Sheldon>Convention that requires you to intervene at all.

<2-17,Sheldon>Twelfth century code of chivalry? not exactly current.

66
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,760
<2-17,Sheldon>你还必须要先成为骑士才可以这么做
<2-17,Sheldon>You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply.

67
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,370
<2-18,Leonard>我才不管  她很难过  我要过去
<2-18,Leonard>I don't care. she's upset, I'm going over there.

68
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,380
<2-19,Howard>记得在手上坐一会  让它们暖和一点
<2-19,Howard>Remember to sit on your hands a bit, so they're warm.

<2-21,Howard>她主动向你投怀送抱
<2-21,Howard>She throws herself at you and demands you take her,

73
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,320
<2-21,Howard>当时当下  你就头不回走人?
<2-21,Howard>Right there, right now, you'll just walk away?

74
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,300
<2-22,Leonard>我说我是她朋友  又不是同志朋友
<2-22,Leonard>I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.

75

<3-1,Leonard (knocking and entering)>听着  我知道你不想说话...
<3-1,Leonard (knocking and entering)>Listen, I know you said you didn't want to talk...

<3-6,Penny>跟我说实话
<3-6,Penny>Tell me the truth.

79
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,300
<3-6,Penny>我是不是那种整天跟大混蛋在一起的傻瓜
<3-6,Penny>Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
<3-8,Penny>那么我就是跟好人在一起  然后把他们都变成了混蛋

<3-11,Leonard>抱歉  是哪两个选项来着?
<3-11,Leonard>I'm sorry, what were the choices again?

<3-12,Penny>体贴  又聪明
<3-12,Penny>Sensitive and smart,

87
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,070
<3-12,Penny>我不是指你那种聪明  是普通不吓人的那种
<3-12,Penny>I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.

88
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,830
<3-13,Leonard>是  是  当然
<3-13,Leonard>Yeah, no, sure.

89
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,360
<3-14,Penny>现在他跑过来羞辱我
<3-14,Penny>And then he just goes and has to humiliate me

90

<3-14,Penny>在博客上写些关于我的东西让全世界的人来看
<3-14,Penny>By writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.

<3-15,Leonard>跟你说吧  那博客不容易被找到的
<3-15,Leonard>I tell you, it's not all that easy to find.

<3-18,Penny>只想钻进洞里然后死去
<3-18,Penny>I just want to crawl into a hole and die!

<3-19,Leonard>你看  这其实没那么糟糕
<3-19,Leonard>Okay. well, you know, this isn't that bad.

103
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,370
<3-19,Leonard>只是描绘了一幅
<3-19,Leonard>It just paints the picture

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,340
<3-19,Leonard>浓情蜜意的女人
<3-19,Leonard>Of a very affectionate woman,

<3-21,Leonard>Movie theaters.

110
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,200
<3-21,Leonard>好奇问一下
<3-21,Leonard>Out of curiosity,

111
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,430
<3-21,Leonard>这里的"地铁"是指交通运输系统
<3-21,Leonard>Is this "subway" the transportation system

112
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,480
<3-21,Leonard>还是那个叫"地铁"的三明治店?

<3-24,Penny>没有  在那里我们只是亲热了一下
<3-24,Penny>No, at the sub shop we were only making out.

116
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,570
<3-25,Leonard>我是想说
<3-25,Leonard>But my point is that

117
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,160
<3-25,Leonard>你完全没有理由觉得尴尬啊
<3-25,Leonard>You have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.

118
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,280
<3-26,Penny>真的吗?  你是不是认为我反应太过了?
<3-26,Penny>Really? do you think I overreacted?

119
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,560
<3-28,Penny>-可能有一点  -我确实经常这样  我是个容易过激的人
<3-28,Penny>-maybe a little. -because I do that. I do overreact.

120
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,580
<3-28,Penny>也许我应该打电话跟麦克道歉
<3-28,Penny>Maybe I should call mike and apologize.

121
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,960
<3-29,Leonard>你这样反应就变成太不过了
<3-29,Leonard>That would be under-reacting.

122
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,020
<3-29,Leonard>他确实把卧室里的隐私都暗示出来了
<3-29,Leonard>He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom.

123
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,140
<3-29,Leonard>在你的橱里  电梯  公园  还有在快餐店
<3-29,Leonard>And in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.

124
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,100
<3-30,Penny>你说得对  我就应该说"我跟他玩完了"
<3-30,Penny>You're right. I should just say "i am done with him."

125
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,060
<3-31,Leonard>对  你就该这么说  说吧
<3-31,Leonard>Yes, you should. go ahead, say it.

126
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,310
<3-32,Penny>但是我还没有给这个男人解释的机会
<3-32,Penny>But I never gave the man a chance to explain.

127
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,300
<3-33,Leonard>有什么好解释的
<3-33,Leonard>What is there to explain?

128
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,560
<3-33,Leonard>都写在这里了
<3-33,Leonard>It's all right here.

129
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,220
<3-33,Leonard>出卖啊!
<3-33,Leonard>The betrayal!

130
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,350
<3-34,Penny>不  你一开始是对的
<3-34,Penny>No, you were right the first time.

131
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,760
<3-34,Penny>这个男人只是用他自己那种很傻的办法爱着我
<3-34,Penny>This is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way,

132
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,410
<3-34,Penny>只是在向世人宣告他的感受
<3-34,Penny>Which is trying to sw w people how he feels.

133
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,810
<3-35,Leonard>我很肯定我没这么说
<3-35,Leonard>I'm pretty sure I never said that.

134
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,660
<3-36,Penny>是  你做得更了不起
<3-36,Penny>No, you did better than that.

135
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,380
<3-36,Penny>你让我自己发现了这个事实
<3-36,Penny>You helped me see it on my own.

136
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,000
<3-37,Leonard>我真棒啊
<3-37,Leonard>Oh, good for me.

137
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,770
<3-37,Leonard>你去哪儿
<3-37,Leonard>Where are you going?

138

141
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,460
<3-39,Leonard>也许我真是她的同性恋朋友
<3-39,Leonard>Huh, maybe I am her gay friend.

142
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,960
<4-1,Sheldon>霍华德  我想我还需要继续上中文课
<4-1,Sheldon>Howard, I'm going to nd d another mandarin lesson.

143

144
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,990
<4-1,Sheldon>听不懂我在说什么
<4-1,Sheldon>My point with those people.

<4-2,Howard>谢尔顿  看在老天的份上
<4-2,Howard>For god's sake, sheldon,

<4-3,Sheldon>I like tangerine chicken,

149
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,780
<4-3,Sheldon>只是他们给我的压根不是陈皮鸡丁
<4-3,Sheldon>I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

150
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,290
<4-4,Leonard>能不能聊点别的?

<4-6,Leonard>扔你的骰子

<4-8,Leonard>她本来在生他的气的!
<4-8,Leonard>She was mad at him!

158
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,050
<4-8,Leonard>她本来跟他玩完了!
<4-8,Leonard>She was done with him!

159

<4-8,Leonard>这段感情已经是不可能挽回的了
<4-8,Leonard>E e relationship was broken beyond repair,

160

162
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,880
<4-10,Sheldon>实际上  我觉得前两个版本
<4-10,Sheldon>Actually, I thought the first two renditions

163
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,040
<4-10,Sheldon>要吸引人得多
<4-10,Sheldon>Were far more compelling.

164
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,800
<4-10,Sheldon>之前  我对那个叫里奥纳德的角色是报以同情
<4-10,Sheldon>Previously, I felt sympathy for the leonard character,

165
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,260
<4-10,Sheldon>现在我只是觉得他很怨妇
<4-10,Sheldon>Now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.

<6-6,Penny>我是在问你是否有空和我聊聊
<6-6,Penny>I was just wondering if I could talk to you.

220
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,790
<6-6,Penny>是关于里奥纳德
<6-6,Penny>It's about leonard.

221
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,120
<6-7,Sheldon>为什么和我聊
<6-7,Sheldon>Why me?

222
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,340
<6-7,Sheldon>为什么不和库萨帕里或者沃尔维茨聊
<6-7,Sheldon>Why not koothrappali or wolowitz?

223
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,090
<6-8,Penny>拉杰不能和我说话  除非他喝醉了
<6-8,Penny>Well, raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk,

224
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,720
<6-8,Penny>而沃尔维茨  你知道的  他令人恶心
<6-8,Penny>And wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

225
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,730
<6-9,Sheldon>是的  我也这么认为
<6-9,Sheldon>Yes, I suppose he is

226
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,340
<6-10,Penny>我想说的是  你最了解里奥纳德了
<6-10,Penny>All I'm saying is, you know leordrd the best.

227
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,540
<6-11,Sheldon>不一定
<6-11,Sheldon>Not necessarily.

228
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,890
<6-11,Sheldon>我常会惊讶于
<6-11,Sheldon>I'm often surprised

229
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,760
<6-11,Sheldon>自己对里奥纳德了解的匮乏
<6-11,Sheldon>By my lack of familiarity with leonard.

230
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,270
<6-11,Sheldon>前几天我发现
<6-11,Sheldon>Just the other day I discovered

231
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,910
<6-11,Sheldon>他不仅有丝瓜络
<6-11,Sheldon>He not only has a loofah,

232
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,470
<6-11,Sheldon>而且还藏起来
<6-11,Sheldon>He hides it.

233
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,610
<6-11,Sheldon>你说为什么一个男人会为使用丝瓜络而感到羞耻
<6-11,Sheldon>Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah?

234
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,540
<6-11,Sheldon>我个人来说  更乐于让自己的上皮细胞
<6-11,Sheldon>I, myself, prefer to have my excess epithelial cells

235
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,830
<6-11,Sheldon>自然脱落  但是我也不责备
<6-11,Sheldon>Slough off naturally, but I d't condemn

236
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,700
<6-11,Sheldon>那些试图加速这个过程的人
<6-11,Sheldon>Those who seek to accelerate the process.

237
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,770
<6-11,Sheldon>...而且直到最近我才知道
<6-11,Sheldon>...and until recently I had no idea

238
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,720
<6-11,Sheldon>尽管他对乳糖过敏
<6-11,Sheldon>That despite his lactose intolerance,

239
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,650
<6-11,Sheldon>但他吃少量不含脂的冰淇淋
<6-11,Sheldon>He can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream

240
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,860
<6-11,Sheldon>却不会产生在我看来
<6-11,Sheldon>Without producing a noxious gas that I maintain,

241
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,150
<6-11,Sheldon>如果适当浓缩  可以成为生化武器的有毒气体
<6-11,Sheldon>In the right concentration, could be weaponize

242
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,290
<6-12,Penny>里奥纳德可能会回来
<6-12,Penny>Leonard might come home.

243
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,810
<6-12,Penny>能去我屋里聊吗
<6-12,Penny>Can we talk in my apartment?

244
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,290
<6-13,Sheldon>我们还没聊完?
<6-13,Sheldon>We're not done?

245
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,470
<6-14,Penny>没有
<6-14,Penny>No.

246
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,700
<6-14,Penny>那好吧
<6-14,Penny>Eh, why not?

247
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,750
<6-15,Sheldon>反正我们已经穿过镜子了(源于"爱丽丝镜中奇遇记")
<6-15,Sheldon>We're already through the looking glass anyway.

248
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,060
<6-16,Penny>好  事情是这样的
<6-16,Penny>Okay, so here's the thing...

249
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,600
<6-16,Penny>我想你已经知道  里奥纳德向我开口了
<6-16,Penny>I guess you're aware that leonard asked me out.

250
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,760
<6-17,Sheldon>他虽然事实上什么都没有说
<6-17,Sheldon>Well, he didn't actually say anything,

251
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,360
<6-17,Sheldon>但他回到房间后
<6-17,Sheldon>But when he came back to the apartment

252
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,340
<6-17,Sheldon>跳起了一支让人能联想起
<6-17,Sheldon>He was doing a dance that brought to mind

253
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,100
<6-17,Sheldon>幻想曲里那只开心河马的舞蹈
<6-17,Sheldon>The happy hippos in fantasia.

254
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,870
<6-17,Sheldon>他真好
<6-17,Sheldon>Oh, that's nice.

255
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,510
<6-18,Penny>无论如何  我想和你说的是
<6-18,Penny>Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about

256
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,730
<6-18,Penny>你知道  自从我和里奥纳德成为朋友以来...
<6-18,Penny>Is, you know, since leonard and I have become friends...

257
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,020
<6-18,Penny>我只是...
<6-18,Penny>I was just...

258
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,850
<6-18,Penny>你要坐下来吗
<6-18,Penny>You want to sit down?

259
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,120
<6-19,Sheldon>能那样简单就好了
<6-19,Sheldon>Oh, I wish it were that simple.

260
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,710
<6-19,Sheldon>我没在这里待过多久
<6-19,Sheldon>See, I don't spend much time here,

261
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,300
<6-19,Sheldon>所以我还从来没有选过一个地方来坐
<6-19,Sheldon>And so I've never really chosen a place to sit.

262
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,490
<6-20,Penny>那选吧
<6-20,Penny>Well, choose.

263
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,480
<6-21,Sheldon>这里有许许多多的选择  而且...
<6-21,Sheldon>There are a number of options, and...

264
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,980
<6-21,Sheldon>我真的不够熟悉座垫的密度
<6-21,Sheldon>I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities,

265
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,320
<6-21,Sheldon>气流模式和阳光的散射
<6-21,Sheldon>Air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight

266
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,910
<6-21,Sheldon>来以便做出一个理性的选择
<6-21,Sheldon>To make an informed choice.

267
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,100
<6-22,Penny>好吧  那你就任意选一处坐
<6-22,Penny>All right.why don't you just pick one at random

268
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,320
<6-22,Penny>如果你不喜欢  下次来再换一个地方
<6-22,Penny>And if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.

269
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,740
<6-22,Penny>不  不  那样太疯狂了
<6-22,Penny>No, no. that's crazy.

270
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,310
<6-23,Sheldon>你继续说  我一边听一边找
<6-23,Sheldon>You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.

271
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,320
<6-23,Sheldon>好吧
<6-23,Sheldon>Okay.

272
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,700
<6-24,Penny>是这样的
<6-24,Penny>Um, here's the thing.

273
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
<6-24,Penny>我已经知道
<6-24,Penny>So I've known for a while now

274
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,610
<6-24,Penny>里奥纳德他有点
<6-24,Penny>That leonard has had

275
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,160
<6-25,Sheldon>喜欢我...
<6-25,Sheldon>A little crush on me...

276
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,880
<6-25,Sheldon>有点喜欢?
<6-25,Sheldon>A little crush?

277
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,210
<6-25,Sheldon>我想是的...就像斯巴达王墨涅劳斯
<6-25,Sheldon>Well, I suppose so--in the same way menelaus

278
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,230
<6-25,Sheldon>有点喜欢特洛伊的海伦一样
<6-25,Sheldon>Had a "little crush" on helen of troy.

279
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,640
<6-26,Penny>好吧  我不知道这些人是谁  但...
<6-26,Penny>All right, yeah, I don't really know who they are, but...

280
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,260
<6-27,Sheldon>墨涅劳斯是阿迦门农的兄弟...
<6-27,Sheldon>Well, menelaus was the brother of agamemnon...

281
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,090
<6-28,Penny>不用了  不用了  听着
<6-28,Penny>I don't care. I don't care. listen.

282
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,810
<6-28,Penny>我要说的是
<6-28,Penny>The point is,

283
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,040
<6-28,Penny>里奥纳德不是那种经常会和我约会的人
<6-28,Penny>Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.

284
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,840
<6-29,Sheldon>里奥纳德不是那种经常会和任何人约会的人
<6-29,Sheldon>Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with.

285
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,310
<6-29,Sheldon>你是否介意把沙发顺时针旋转30度
<6-29,Sheldon>Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

286
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
<6-30,Penny>不行  我想说的是
<6-30,Penny>No. what I'm saying is

287
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,330
<6-30,Penny>里奥纳德与其他人不同可能是件好事
<6-30,Penny>Leonard might be different in a good way.

288
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,550
<6-30,Penny>很明显  我平时的选择都不怎么的好
<6-30,Penny>Obviously, my usual choices have not worked out so well.

289
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,600
<6-31,Sheldon>你上一个对库萨帕里来说很好
<6-31,Sheldon>Your last one worked out well for koothrappali.

290
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,040
<6-31,Sheldon>他得到了一个免费的ipod
<6-31,Sheldon>He got a free ipod.

291
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,990
<6-31,Sheldon>刺眼
<6-31,Sheldon>Oh, glare.

292
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,380
<6-32,Penny>但换个角度来说  如果和里奥纳德进展不顺利
<6-32,Penny>On the other hand, if things don't go well with leonard,

293
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,560
<6-32,Penny>我可能会失去一个很好的朋友
<6-32,Penny>I risk losing a really good friend.

294
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,520
<6-32,Penny>我意思是  他不会是一时放纵的人
<6-32,Penny>I mean, I'm guessing he's not looking for a fling.

295
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,380
<6-32,Penny>他是那种陷入一段感情后会持续
<6-32,Penny>He's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship

296
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,870
<6-32,Penny>我不知道  可能你会说  光年
<6-32,Penny>For, I don't know, like you would say, light years.

297
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,270
<6-33,Sheldon>我不会那么说
<6-33,Sheldon>I would not say that.

298
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:22,990
<6-33,Sheldon>没有人
<6-33,Sheldon>No one

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,710
<6-33,Sheldon>会那么说
<6-33,Sheldon>Would say that.

300
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,430
<6-33,Sheldon>光年是一个距离单位而不是一个时间单位
<6-33,Sheldon>A light year is a unit of distance not time.

301
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,660
<6-34,Penny>谢谢你的说明
<6-34,Penny>Thank you for the clarification.

302
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,220
<6-35,Sheldon>换
<6-35,Sheldon>Draft.

303
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,120
<6-35,Sheldon>人们听到年这个词的时候
<6-35,Sheldon>See, people hear the word "year"

304
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,470
<6-35,Sheldon>他们想到的是持续的一段时间
<6-35,Sheldon>And they think duration.

305
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,320
<6-35,Sheldon>"尺磅"也有这样的问题...
<6-35,Sheldon>"foot-pound" has the same problem--

306
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,270
<6-35,Sheldon>它是一个能量单位  而不是一个重量单位
<6-35,Sheldon>That's a unit of work, not of weight.

307
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,480
<6-36,Penny>没错  谢谢
<6-36,Penny>Right. thanks.

308
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,470
<6-37,Sheldon>这是常识性错误
<6-37,Sheldon>It's common mistake.

309
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,410
<6-38,Penny>这不是我今天犯的第一个错了
<6-38,Penny>Not the first one I've made today.

310
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,900
<6-38,Penny>好
<6-38,Penny>Okay.

311
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,410
<6-39,Sheldon>我觉得这就是我的座位了
<6-39,Sheldon>I think this will be my seat.

312
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,110
<6-40,Penny>谢尔顿  你有什么可以说的吗
<6-40,Penny>Sheldon, do you have anything to say

313
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,590
<6-40,Penny>任何内容  你知道
<6-40,Penny>That has anything to do with, you know,

314
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,310
<6-40,Penny>只要和我在说的有关的
<6-40,Penny>What I'm talking about?

315
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,390
<6-41,Sheldon>好  让我想想
<6-41,Sheldon>Well, let's see...

316
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,620
<6-41,Sheldon>我们也许可以参考"薛定谔猫"
<6-41,Sheldon>We might cononsider schrodinger's cat.

317
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,420
<6-42,Penny>薛定谔
<6-42,Penny>Schrodinger?

318
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,710
<6-42,Penny>是住2楼A座的那个女人吗
<6-42,Penny>Is that the woman in 2a?

319
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,190
<6-43,Sheldon>不  那位是格洛辛格女士
<6-43,Sheldon>No, that's mrs. grossinger.

320
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,300
<6-43,Sheldon>并且她不养猫  她养的是一只墨西哥无毛犬
<6-43,Sheldon>And she doesn't have a cat, she has a mexican hairless.

321
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,820
<6-43,Sheldon>超烦人的一种小动物
<6-43,Sheldon>Annoying little animal. yip, yip, yip, yip.

322
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,350
<6-44,Penny>谢尔顿
<6-44,Penny>Sheldon.

323
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,930
<6-45,Sheldon>对不起  你又让我跑题了
<6-45,Sheldon>Sorry, you diverted me.

324
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,750
<6-51,Sheldon>在1935年  埃尔文·薛定谔
<6-51,Sheldon>Anyway, in 1935, erwin schrodinger,

325
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,180
<6-45,Sheldon>尝试去说明在量子物理学中的
<6-45,Sheldon>In an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation

326
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,120
<6-45,Sheldon>哥本哈根解释
<6-45,Sheldon>Of quantum physics,

327
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,450
<6-45,Sheldon>他做了个实验
<6-45,Sheldon>He proposed an experimen

328
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,360
<6-45,Sheldon>把一只猫和一小瓶密封好的毒药一起放在盒子里
<6-45,Sheldon>Where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison

329
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,260
<6-45,Sheldon>毒药瓶随时会破裂
<6-45,Sheldon>That will break open at a random time.

330
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,090
<6-45,Sheldon>好  除非你打开盒子
<6-45,Sheldon>Now, since no one knows when

331
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,190
<6-45,Sheldon>不然没人知道毒药是否
<6-45,Sheldon>Or if the poison has been released,

332
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,790
<6-45,Sheldon>或者是何时已经被释放了
<6-45,Sheldon>Until the box is opened,

333
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,050
<6-45,Sheldon>因此我们认为猫或活或死都是可以的
<6-45,Sheldon>The cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.

334
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,720
<6-46,Penny>对不起  我没听明白
<6-46,Penny>I'm sorry. I don't get the point.

335
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,110
<6-47,Sheldon>你当然不会明白  我还没说呢
<6-47,Sheldon>Wellofof course you don't get it; I haven't made it yet.

336
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,300
<6-47,Sheldon>你只有靠第六感才能明白了
<6-47,Sheldon>You'd have to be psychic to get it,

337
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,480
<6-47,Sheldon>而事实是根本就没有"第六感"这个东西
<6-47,Sheldon>And there's no such thing as "psychic."

338
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,900
<6-48,Penny>谢尔顿  你到底想说什么?
<6-48,Penny>Sheldon, what's the point?!

339
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,030
<6-49,Sheldon>就好像"薛定谔猫"
<6-49,Sheldon>Just like schrodinger's cat,

340
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,720
<6-49,Sheldon>现在你和里奥纳德潜在的可能
<6-49,Sheldon>Your potential relationship with leonard right now

341
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,070
<6-49,Sheldon>既可以被认为是美好的也可以是不好的
<6-49,Sheldon>Can be thought of as both good and bad.

342
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,820
<6-49,Sheldon>只有当你打开盒子
<6-49,Sheldon>It is only by opening the box

343
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,510
<6-49,Sheldon>你才知道到底是哪一种
<6-49,Sheldon>That you'll find out which it is.

344
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,640
<6-50,Penny>明白了  你是说我应该先跟里奥纳德处处看
<6-50,Penny>Okay, so you're saying I should go out with leonard.

345
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,410
<6-51,Sheldon>不不  不不
<6-51,Sheldon>No, no, no, no, no.

346
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,170
<6-51,Sheldon>我再说一遍吧
<6-51,Sheldon>Let me start again.

347
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,740
<6-51,Sheldon>在1935年  埃尔文·薛定谔...
<6-51,Sheldon>In 1935, erwin schrodinger...

348
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,080
<7-1,Leonard (pointing)>那儿有俩座
<7-1,Leonard (pointing)>Two seats right there.

349
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,920
<7-1,Leonard (pointing)>长寿石灰?
<7-1,Leonard (pointing)>Chung shu shway?

350
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,170
<7-1,Leonard (pointing)>谢谢
<7-1,Leonard (pointing)>Shay shay.

351
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,320
<7-3,Leonard>谢尔顿  我想我办错了件事
<7-3,Leonard>Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

352
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,360
<7-4,Sheldon>我知道
<7-4,Sheldon>I can see that.

353
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,020
<7-4,Sheldon>除非你是在备战马拉松
<7-4,Sheldon>Unless you're planning on running a marathon,

354
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,850
<7-4,Sheldon>不然填塞陷儿和土豆泥都要
<7-4,Sheldon>Choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes

355
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,580
<7-4,Sheldon>简直就是淀粉摄入过量
<7-4,Sheldon>Is a starch-filled redundancy.

356
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,340
<7-5,Leonard>不  是关于潘妮的
<7-5,Leonard>No, it's about penny.

357
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,330
<7-6,Sheldon>关于潘妮的错误
<7-6,Sheldon>A mistake involving penny.

358
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,600
<7-6,Sheldon>好吧  我得缩小范围了
<7-6,Sheldon>Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

359
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,330
<7-7,Leonard>我觉得今天晚上我不能跟她去约会
<7-7,Leonard>I don't think I can go out with her tonight.

360
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,290
<7-8,Sheldon>那就别去
<7-8,Sheldon>Then don't.

361
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,320
<7-9,Leonard>别人一般会说"为什么不去"
<7-9,Leonard>Other pelele would say "why not?"

362
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,060
<7-10,Sheldon>别人可能比较感兴趣
<7-10,Sheldon>Other people might be interested.

363
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,320
<7-11,Leonard>反正我还是要说
<7-11,Leonard>I'm going to talk anyway.

364
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,580
<7-12,Sheldon>我猜你也是
<7-12,Sheldon>I assumed you would.

365
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,200
<7-13,Leonard>现在我真的要和潘妮去约会了
<7-13,Leonard>Now that I'm actually about to go out with penny,

366
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,930
<7-13,Leonard>我反而并不激动  我反胃
<7-13,Leonard>I'm not excited--i'm nauseous.

367
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,860
<7-14,Sheldon>那你的食物就是选对了
<7-14,Sheldon>Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate.

368
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,820
<7-14,Sheldon>淀粉能吸收对于呕吐起作用的
<7-14,Sheldon>Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit

369
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,500
<7-14,Sheldon>催吐物质
<7-14,Sheldon>Available for violent expulsion.

370
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,740
<7-16,Sheldon>-好吧  -你还犯了
<7-16,Sheldon>Right. you also made

371
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,020
<7-16,Sheldon>一个文法上的错误
<7-16,Sheldon>A common grammatical mistake.

372
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,510
<7-16,Sheldon>你说的是"反胃的"  其实你想说"让人作呕的"
<7-16,Sheldon>You said "nauseous," when you meant "nauseated."

373
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,540
<7-16,Sheldon>你接着说
<7-16,Sheldon>But go on.

374
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,480
<7-17,Leonard>谢尔顿  这次约会很可能就是我唯一的机会
<7-17,Leonard>Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with penny.

375
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,130
<7-17,Leonard>我如果搞砸了怎么办?
<7-17,Leonard>What happens if I blow it?

376
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,680
<7-18,Sheldon>好  假设我们按你说的前提
<7-18,Sheldon>Well, if we accept your premise

377
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,350
<7-18,Sheldon>并且承认潘妮就是上帝安排给你的另一半
<7-18,Sheldon>And also accept the highly improbable assumption

378
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,530
<7-18,Sheldon>这个极不可能的假设
<7-18,Sheldon>That penny is the only woman in the world for you,

379
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,680
<7-18,Sheldon>那我们从逻辑上可以得出的结论是
<7-18,Sheldon>Then we can logically conclude that the result

380
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,750
<7-18,Sheldon>如果你搞砸这次约会  后果就是
<7-18,Sheldon>Of blowing it would  be that you end up

381
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,240
<7-18,Sheldon>你将会孤独  辛酸地终老  并且没有后代
<7-18,Sheldon>A lonely, bitter old man with no progeny.

382
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,550
<7-18,Sheldon>我脑中突然浮现了史酷比动画片里
<7-18,Sheldon>The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers

383
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,600
<7-18,Sheldon>一群邪恶的灯塔管理员的画面
<7-18,Sheldon>From scooby-doo cartoons comes to mind.

384
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,070
<7-19,Leonard>你这是在捣乱
<7-19,Leonard>You're not helping.

385
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,350
<7-20,Sheldon>好吧  我怎么回答你
<7-20,Sheldon>All right, what respon on my part

386
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,780
<7-20,Sheldon>才能赶紧结束这个话题呢?
<7-20,Sheldon>Would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?

387
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,450
<7-21,Leonard>你就告诉我该不该去赴约
<7-21,Leonard>Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.

388
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,050
<7-22,Sheldon>薛定谔猫
<7-22,Sheldon>Scododinger's cat.

389
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,400
<7-23,Leonard>太聪明了
<7-23,Leonard>Wow,that's brilliant.

390
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,340
<7-24,Sheldon>你听起来很吃惊啊
<7-24,Sheldon>You sound surprised.

391
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,250
<7-24,Sheldon>猴子睡在里头
<7-24,Sheldon>Ho-tsu shway zai li-toe.
