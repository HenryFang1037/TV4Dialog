1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,270
<1-1,Leonard>知道了吧 你吃的这个 不算是真的酸奶酪
<1-1,Leonard>so you see what you eating is not technically yogurt,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,910
<1-1,Leonard>因为里面没有足够的 活的嗜酸培养菌
<1-1,Leonard>because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,420
<1-1,Leonard>只不过是冰牛奶里加了点 角叉胶 增加粘稠度
<1-1,Leonard>It's really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,530
<1-2,Penny>喔 真有意思哈
<1-2,Penny>Oh,that's very interesting.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,530
<1-3,Leonard>它也不真是粉红色 也没有天然浆果粒
<1-3,Leonard>It's also not pink and has no berries.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,010
<1-4,Penny>嗯 可这也没有回答我的问题呐
<1-4,Penny>Yeah,but it doesn't really answer my question.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,550
<1-5,Leonard>你问的啥问题?
<1-5,Leonard>What was your question again?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,730
<1-6,Penny>你要来点儿不?
<1-6,Penny>Do you want some?

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,700
<1-7,Leonard>对对 不用了
<1-7,Leonard>Right. No.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,060
<1-7,Leonard>- 我受不了乳糖的 - 对哦
<1-7,Leonard>- I'm lactose intolerant. - Right.

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,550
<1-10,Penny>- 吃了会放屁的 - 好吧 明白了
<1-10,Penny>- So,gas. - Yeah,got it.

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,390
<1-11,Leonard>那么... 晚安了
<1-11,Leonard>Well... good night.

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,540
<1-12,Penny>你这是做什么呢?
<1-12,Penny>What are you doing?

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,210
<1-13,Leonard>哦 那边有阵风
<1-13,Leonard>Oh,there's a draft.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,620
<1-14,Penny>我没觉得有风啊
<1-14,Penny>I didn't feel a draft.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,770
<1-15,Leonard>那我们还是去... 你的...
<1-15,Leonard>Why don't we just go into,uh,your...

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,670
<1-16,Penny>我说 也许我们不该那么着急
<1-16,Penny>Yeah,you know what,maybe we should slow things down a little.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,520
<1-17,Leonard>不 我不是说要去你公寓 去急着干嘛干嘛
<1-17,Leonard>No,no,I didn't mean to go into your apartment to go fast.

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,540
<1-18,Penny>当然了 我知道
<1-18,Penny>No,I know.

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,440
<1-18,Penny>我知道你不是那意思 只是... 这才是咱俩第一次约会
<1-18,Penny>I know what you meant,it's just... this is only our first date.

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,840
<1-19,Leonard>嗯 好啊 没问题
<1-19,Leonard>Yeah,okay,sure,no problem.

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,710
<1-19,Leonard>那我们就先想想 下次要去哪儿 准备啥时候到那儿
<1-19,Leonard>Why don't we just figure out where we're going and when we want to get there,

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,490
<1-19,Leonard>这样距离除以时间 就知道速度了呗
<1-19,Leonard>and then rate of speed equals distance over time.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,520
<1-19,Leonard>问题解决
<1-19,Leonard>Solve for R.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,080
<1-20,Penny>我们也可以到时候再想嘛
<1-20,Penny>Or we could just wing it.

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,720
<1-21,Leonard>那没准也行
<1-21,Leonard>That might work,too.

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,820
<1-21,Leonard>- 晚安 莱纳德- 晚安
<1-21,Leonard>- Good night,Leonard. - Good night.

28
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,090
<2-1,Raj>他来了 快上屏保!
<2-1,Raj>He's coming-- screensaver!

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,220
<2-2,Howard>嘿 莱纳德约会怎么样哇?
<2-2,Howard>Oh,hey,Leonard. How was your date?

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,290
<2-3,Leonard>要你管
<2-3,Leonard>Bite me.

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,870
<2-3,Leonard>谢尔顿 你怎么能傻坐着 眼睁睁看他们监视我呢?
<2-3,Leonard>Sheldon,how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
<2-4,Sheldon>他们油菜啊 莱纳德
<2-4,Sheldon>They were clever,Leonard.

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,450
<2-4,Sheldon>他们完全明白 我对你那些破事儿 一点兴趣没有
<2-4,Sheldon>They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,070
<2-5,Howard>你还该谢谢我们呢
<2-5,Howard>You should thank us.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,800
<2-5,Howard>要是后来人想弄明白 你和佩妮的恋情为啥会土崩瓦解
<2-5,Howard>When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned,

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,100
<2-5,Howard>这玩意儿就是黑匣子呐!
<2-5,Howard>this right here is the black box.

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,750
<2-6,Leonard>你胡说什么 约会挺好的
<2-6,Leonard>What are you talking about? The date went fine.

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,760
<2-7,Raj>拜托 她都说了 想要慢慢来
<2-7,Raj>Dude,she said she wants to slow things down.

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,880
<2-7,Raj>好吧 她是说了 想要慢慢来
<2-7,Raj>Okay,so she said she wants to slow things down.

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,850
<2-8,Leonard>意思差不多就是 "今天的晚餐我非常喜欢
<2-8,Leonard>It's like saying,"I'm really enjoying this meal.

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,230
<2-9,Howard>我得慢慢来 好好回味一下"
<2-9,Howard>I'm going to slow down and savor it."

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,600
<2-9,Howard>才怪 她的意思是 "这鱼真难吃死了
<2-9,Howard>No,it's like,"This fish tastes bad,

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,850
<2-9,Howard>我得慢慢来 吐光了它"
<2-9,Howard>so I'm gonna slow down and spit it out."

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,010
<2-10,Raj>- 这臭鱼说的就是你! - 我才不是这臭鱼呢
<2-10,Raj>- You being the fish. - I'm not the fish.

45
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,250
<2-12,Howard>真的? 你俩定了下一次约会吗?
<2-12,Howard>Oh,really? Did you make a second date?

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,150
<2-13,Leonard>这倒没有... 我们说好了 到时候再想
<2-13,Leonard>Well,no,we sort of decided to wing it.

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,270
<2-14,Sheldon>得了吧 连我都觉得这太逊了
<2-14,Sheldon>Oh,even I know that's lame.

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,490
<2-15,Leonard>行啊 咱就说说你的假设
<2-15,Leonard>Okay,all right,let's assume your hypothesis.

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,960
<2-15,Leonard>我们一起去吃饭 有说有笑 有吻有抱
<2-15,Leonard>We went to dinner,we talked,we laughed,we kissed.

50
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,820
<2-15,Leonard>这还能错到哪儿去啊?
<2-15,Leonard>Where could I have possibly gone wrong?

51
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,010
<2-16,Howard>你好好想想 莱纳德
<2-16,Howard>Think back,Leonard.

52
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,140
<2-16,Howard>再小的事情都能让女人爆发
<2-16,Howard>The littlest things can set women off.

53
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,020
<2-16,Howard>比方说 "嘿 这服务生真辣 我打赌 肯定能让她跟咱回家"
<2-16,Howard>Like,"Hey,the waitress is hot,I bet we could get her to come home with us."

54
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,840
<2-16,Howard>或者 "你妈妈有多重呐?
<2-16,Howard>Or,"How much does your mom weigh?

55
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,230
<2-16,Howard>我想知道我搭上的是啥样的妞儿"
<2-16,Howard>I want to know what I'm getting into."

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,650
<2-17,Leonard>这种话我才不会说
<2-17,Leonard>I didn't say anything like that.

57
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,540
<2-18,Howard>很好 因为这么说不管用
<2-18,Howard>Good,'cause they don't work.

58
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,260
<2-19,Raj>她们也不关心 你是不是盯着她们 呼吸加速
<2-19,Raj>They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

59
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,330
<2-19,Raj>挺惨的 在我们家 这就像是家族传统
<2-19,Raj>Sadly,that's my home run swing.

60
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,640
<2-20,Leonard>我说 一切都挺好的
<2-20,Leonard>Look,everything went fine.

61
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,940
<2-20,Leonard>连事先准备的一些开场白都没用到呢
<2-20,Leonard>I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters.

62
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,790
<2-20,Leonard>走廊对面那个女孩 就是喜欢我嘛
<2-20,Leonard>That woman across the hall is into me.

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,610
<2-21,Howard>咱还是看带子吧
<2-21,Howard>Let's go to the tape.

64
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,710
<2-21,Howard>你瞧她临别一吻的时候 那反应
<2-21,Howard>Look at her reaction to the good night kiss.

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,230
<2-21,Howard>呼吸平稳 瞳孔没有放大 胸口也没啥起伏
<2-21,Howard>No change in respiration,pupils un-dilated,no flushing of the chest.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,150
<2-22,Raj>这特写镜头拍的真赞
<2-22,Raj>Nice close-up,by the way.

67
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,810
<2-23,Sheldon>有意思嘿 她的下巴很紧 也没有用舌头
<2-23,Sheldon>Interesting. Her jaws are clenched: no tongue access.

68
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,610
<2-23,Sheldon>对于寻偶期的人类来说 这可不是啥好消息
<2-23,Sheldon>Clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.

69
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,250
<2-24,Leonard>这怎么就不是好消息了
<2-24,Leonard>That's not a bad sign.

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,540
<2-25,Sheldon>得了吧 还不如说你们是两只鬣蜥 只是喉部没有垂肉罢了
<2-25,Sheldon>Please,you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

71
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,780
<2-26,Raj>最糟的就是 这会儿你不在她家 而在这里!
<2-26,Raj>And the worst sign of all is you're here and not there.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,940
<2-27,Leonard>我不在她家 因为我也决定慢慢来 这个...
<2-27,Leonard>I'm not there because I'm taking things slow,which,

73
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,050
<2-27,Leonard>跟你们比起来 都快接近星际速度了
<2-27,Leonard>by the way,compared to you guys,approaches warp speed.

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,490
<2-27,Leonard>快把摄像头给我撤了
<2-27,Leonard>And take down that camera.

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,820
<2-28,Raj>他心里没牵没挂的时候 真有意思多了
<2-28,Raj>He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,200
<2-29,Howard>给他点时间吧
<2-29,Howard>Give him time.

77
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,480
<3-1,Penny (entering)>你好啊 佩妮
<3-1,Penny (entering)>Oh,hi,Penny.

78
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,550
<3-2,Sheldon>顺便说句 2号机器的热水不足 别深色浅色混着洗
<3-2,Sheldon>FYI,the hot water is inadequate on machine two,so colors only,

79
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,460
<3-2,Sheldon>4号机器呢 洗衣程序中 还是会提前放出织物柔顺剂
<3-2,Sheldon>and four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle,

80
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,230
<3-2,Sheldon>所以你那些精致的衣服 还是别用那台了
<3-2,Sheldon>so I'd avoid using that for your delicates.

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,220
<3-3,Penny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once)>谢了
<3-3,Penny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once)>Thanks.

82
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,200
<3-4,Sheldon>老天爷啊...
<3-4,Sheldon>Oh,good Lord...

83
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,820
<3-4,Sheldon>你还不如把衣服拿到河边 搁在石头上猛捶一阵
<3-4,Sheldon>why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?

84
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,740
<3-5,Penny>谢尔顿 我问你个问题行不?
<3-5,Penny>Sheldon,can I ask you a question?

85
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,210
<3-6,Sheldon>我当然最好你别问 不过也不会阻止你
<3-6,Sheldon>I would prefer that you not,but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

86
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,270
<3-7,Penny>那... 我就当你同意了...
<3-7,Penny>All right,I heard yes,so...

87
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,070
<3-7,Penny>我想问问你
<3-7,Penny>Okay,here's my question.

88
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,190
<3-7,Penny>莱纳德以前有没有 跟正常的女孩子约会过?
<3-7,Penny>Has Leonard ever dated,you know,a regular girl?

89
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,570
<3-8,Sheldon>我想你指的 应该不是消化功能正常吧
<3-8,Sheldon>Well,I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity.

90
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,810
<3-8,Sheldon>要是那样的话 我想这问题问的不合适
<3-8,Sheldon>Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.

91
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,760
<3-9,Penny>我是说 他有没有跟 没那么大学问的女孩子谈过?
<3-9,Penny>No,I meant,has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:45,170
<3-10,Sheldon>话说几年前 他确实跟一个 学法国文学的女博士有过一段儿
<3-10,Sheldon>Well,a few years ago,he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French literature.

93
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,180
<3-11,Penny>这还不算有大学问?
<3-11,Penny>How is that not a brainiac?

94
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,250
<3-12,Sheldon>理由一 她是法国人
<3-12,Sheldon>Well,for one thing,she was French.

95
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,700
<3-12,Sheldon>理由二 她读的是文学
<3-12,Sheldon>For another,it was literature.

96
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,220
<3-12,Sheldon>那你觉得...
<3-12,Sheldon>So...

97
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,000
<3-13,Penny>如果我和莱纳德继续好下去 他会不会有一天觉得我很没劲啊?
<3-13,Penny>do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating,he'll eventually get bored with me?

98
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,500
<3-14,Sheldon>- 那得看情况 - 什么情况?
<3-14,Sheldon>- That depends. - On what?

99
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,160
<3-16,Sheldon>- 你懂量子物理吗? - 不懂
<3-16,Sheldon>- Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? - No.

100
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,030
<3-18,Sheldon>- 你会说克林贡语(《星际迷航》影片中的外星语)吗? - 不会
<3-18,Sheldon>- Do you speak Klingon? - No.

101
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,200
<3-20,Sheldon>- 你会耍牌吗? - 行了 我说...
<3-20,Sheldon>- You know any card tricks? - Okay,you know what...

102
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,350
<3-20,Sheldon>我明白了
<3-20,Sheldon>I get it.

103
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,840
<3-21,Penny>莱纳德和一个服务员兼二流演员 没有共同语言
<3-21,Penny>Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress-slash-actress

104
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,490
<3-21,Penny>而且她还骗他说 上完了社区大学 心里正发慌呢
<3-21,Penny>who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.

105
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,070
<3-22,Sheldon>你为什么撒谎?
<3-22,Sheldon>Why would you lie about that?

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,200
<3-23,Penny>他总是在说这大学怎样 那个研究生院怎么样 我就...
<3-23,Penny>Well,he was going on and on about this college and that grad school,and I...

107
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,740
<3-23,Penny>我不想让他觉得我很傻很衰嘛
<3-23,Penny>I didn't want him to think I was some kind of stupid loser.

108
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,530
<3-24,Sheldon>你觉得"很傻很衰"的反义词 是"社区大学毕业生"?
<3-24,Sheldon>You thought the opposite of "stupid loser" was "community college graduate"?

109
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,480
<3-25,Penny>很多成功人士 都是从社区大学毕业的
<3-25,Penny>You know,there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.

110
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,010
<3-26,Sheldon>没错 可你哪个都挨不上边
<3-26,Sheldon>Yeah,but you are neither.

111
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,030
<3-27,Penny>对 好吧 你得替我保密
<3-27,Penny>Right. Okay,look,this is between you and me.

112
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,560
<3-27,Penny>啥也不要告诉莱纳德
<3-27,Penny>You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

113
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,290
<3-28,Sheldon>- 你要我保守秘密? - 是的
<3-28,Sheldon>- You're asking me to keep a secret? - Yeah.

114
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,930
<3-30,Sheldon>那真对不起了 你应该在说出秘密前 表达出要我保密的意思
<3-30,Sheldon>Well,I'm sorry,but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret,

115
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,260
<3-30,Sheldon>我好选择 到底要不要替你保密
<3-30,Sheldon>so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping.

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,300
<3-30,Sheldon>你事后再说 这怎么行呢
<3-30,Sheldon>You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.

117
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,250
<3-31,Penny>什么?
<3-31,Penny>What?

118
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,670
<3-32,Sheldon>保守秘密是一项艰巨复杂的任务
<3-32,Sheldon>Secret keeping is a complicated endeavor.

119
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,130
<3-32,Sheldon>不但要注意说的话
<3-32,Sheldon>One has to be concerned not only about what one says,

120
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,310
<3-32,Sheldon>还得注意面部表情 习惯性反应
<3-32,Sheldon>but about facial expressions,autonomic reflexes.

121
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,620
<3-32,Sheldon>我说谎的时候 因为紧张产生的壁虱(tick) 比莱姆关节炎研究设备产生的还多
<3-32,Sheldon>When I try to deceive,I myself have more nervous tics than a Lyme disease research facility.

122
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,240
<3-32,Sheldon>这是笑话啊
<3-32,Sheldon>It's a joke.

123
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,480
<3-32,Sheldon>同音词嘛 "tick"是指
<3-32,Sheldon>It relies on the homonymic relationship between "tick,"

124
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,440
<3-32,Sheldon>吸血寄生虫（壁虱） 而"tic"是无意识的肌肉痉挛
<3-32,Sheldon>the bloodsucking arachnid,and "tic," the involuntary muscular contraction.

125
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,730
<3-32,Sheldon>我自己编的
<3-32,Sheldon>I made it up myself.

126
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,290
<3-33,Penny>听着 如果莱纳德发现我说谎 我一定羞愧自尽了
<3-33,Penny>Okay,look,if Leonard finds out that I lied,I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

127
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,510
<3-34,Sheldon>生理学上讲是不可能的
<3-34,Sheldon>Physiologically impossible.

128
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
<3-35,Penny>哦 谢尔顿 拜托
<3-35,Penny>Oh,Sheldon,please.

129
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,750
<3-35,Penny>我是以朋友的名义请求你
<3-35,Penny>Look,I am asking you as a friend.

130
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,810
<3-36,Sheldon>照你这么说 朋友就要无条件的保守秘密?
<3-36,Sheldon>So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?

131
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,510
<3-37,Penny>是啊
<3-37,Penny>Well,yeah.

132
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,880
<3-37,Penny>有意思
<3-37,Penny>Interesting.

133
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,680
<3-38,Sheldon>再一个问题 或许应该这样问
<3-38,Sheldon>One more question,and perhaps I should have led with this.

134
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,390
<3-38,Sheldon>我们什么时候成朋友了?
<3-38,Sheldon>When did we become friends?

135
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,300
<4-1,Sheldon>也就是说 要不被总部守护先知选中 我就成不了绿灯侠(漫画人物)
<4-1,Sheldon>i.e.,I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa,

136
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,480
<4-1,Sheldon>但如果给我足够的启动资金和 足够的科研设备 我就能成为蝙蝠侠
<4-1,Sheldon>but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility,I could be Batman.

137
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,500
<4-2,Leonard>- 你能成为蝙蝠侠? - 当然 我就是蝙蝠侠 看见没?
<4-2,Leonard>- You could be Batman? - Sure. I'm Batman. See?

138
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,470
<4-4,Penny (arriving)>- 嗨 伙计们 - 嗨 佩妮
<4-4,Penny (arriving)>- Hi,guys. - Hi,Penny.

139
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,570
<4-7,Leonard>佩妮 你周五晚上有空的话 我们去看电影吧
<4-7,Leonard>Penny,if you're not doing anything Friday night,I thought maybe we could go see a movie.

140
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,550
<4-8,Penny>呃 我周五晚上要轮班
<4-8,Penny>Oh,um,you know,I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.

141
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,190
<4-9,Leonard>好吧 周六呢?
<4-9,Leonard>Okay,what about Saturday?

142
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,340
<4-10,Penny>说不准 经理还没公布排班表呢
<4-10,Penny>You know,I'm not sure; the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet.

143
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,470
<4-10,Penny>- 出来了 我再告诉你? - 很好
<4-10,Penny>- How about I let you know? - Great.

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,450
<4-11,Leonard>那你知道了就告诉我 好的 那...
<4-11,Leonard>So you just let me know when you know. Okay,so...

145
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,500
<4-11,Leonard>天呐 我就是那条臭鱼
<4-11,Leonard>Oh,God,I am the bad fish.

146
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,710
<4-11,Leonard>我哪做错了?
<4-11,Leonard>What did I do wrong?

147
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,850
<4-12,Sheldon>你为什么问我?
<4-12,Sheldon>Why are you asking me?

148
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,190
<4-12,Sheldon>你和佩妮的事儿 除了你已经告诉我的 我啥也不知道
<4-12,Sheldon>I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you have provided me,

149
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,600
<4-12,Sheldon>我也没有本事学到
<4-12,Sheldon>nor do I have any method of learning such things.

150
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,690
<4-13,Leonard (chasing him)>- 这话什么意思? - 没什么
<4-13,Leonard (chasing him)>- What does that mean? - Nothing.

151
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,100
<4-14,Sheldon>你说的倒像是 我和佩妮背地里通了气
<4-14,Sheldon>You seem to be implying an informational back-channel

152
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,420
<4-14,Sheldon>很明显 这是没有的事
<4-14,Sheldon>between me and Penny where obviously none exists.

153
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,460
<4-15,Leonard>没 我没觉得
<4-15,Leonard>No,I didn't.

154
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,220
<4-16,Sheldon>我想你要注意你的表达了 先生
<4-16,Sheldon>I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things,sir.

155
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,150
<4-17,Leonard>你怎么回事?
<4-17,Leonard>What's going on with you?

156
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,080
<4-18,Sheldon>这问题我也得问问你吧
<4-18,Sheldon>I might ask you the same question.

157
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,000
<4-18,Sheldon>那些跟我无关的事儿 你何必非要把我扯进去?
<4-18,Sheldon>Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me,

158
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,130
<4-18,Sheldon>都是你和佩妮之间的事 我跟她连话都不怎么说的
<4-18,Sheldon>but exist between you and Penny,a person to whom I barely speak?

159
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,480
<4-19,Leonard>你脸怎么了?
<4-19,Leonard>What's wrong with your face?

160
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,780
<4-20,Sheldon>我脸这样 没啥原因
<4-20,Sheldon>There's no reason to bring my looks into this.

161
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,260
<4-20,Sheldon>- 祝你今天过的愉快 莱纳德- 什么?
<4-20,Sheldon>- Good day,Leonard. - What

162
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,530
<4-22,Sheldon>我说 "祝你今天过的愉快"
<4-22,Sheldon>I said,"Good day."

163
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,450
<4-23,Leonard>过的愉快?
<4-23,Leonard>Good day?

164
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
<5-1,Penny>今天还为您供应 新鲜的阿拉斯加大马哈鱼
<5-1,Penny>Also today,we have a fresh-caught Alaska salmon,

165
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,800
<5-1,Penny>配上烧汁和糯米饭
<5-1,Penny>and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice.

166
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,570
<5-1,Penny>今天的汤是...
<5-1,Penny>Our soup of the day is...

167
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,370
<5-2,Sheldon (appearing behind her)>你必须将我从我的誓言中解放出来
<5-2,Sheldon (appearing behind her)>You must release me from my oath.

168
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,240
<5-3,Penny>谢尔顿 我在工作
<5-3,Penny>Sheldon,I'm working.

169
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,140
<5-4,Sheldon>你们花几分钟决定一下吧
<5-4,Sheldon>Why don't you take a minute to decide?

170
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,100
<5-4,Sheldon>我不能保守你的秘密了 佩妮
<5-4,Sheldon>I can't keep your secret,Penny.

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,760
<5-4,Sheldon>我就像构象空间里 基于能量的内源蛋白 要折叠起来了 (fold 也有失败的意思)
<5-4,Sheldon>I'm going to fold like an energy-based de novo protein in conformational space.

172
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,880
<5-4,Sheldon>就像是文艺复兴时期的三联画 (教堂祭坛上的饰物 两翼可向内折叠)
<5-4,Sheldon>Like a Renaissance tryptich.

173
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,820
<5-4,Sheldon>还有廉价的西装
<5-4,Sheldon>Like a cheap suit.

174
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,050
<5-5,Penny>你保守个小秘密 咋就这么难呢?
<5-5,Penny>Look,why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?

175
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,130
<5-6,Sheldon>我天生就保守不住!
<5-6,Sheldon>I'm constitutionally incapable.

176
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,010
<5-6,Sheldon>所以我上次申请那项高端政府研究奖学金 证明开不出来
<5-6,Sheldon>That's why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship

177
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,380
<5-6,Sheldon>项目里的超级对撞机 位于密歇根州 特拉弗斯城东南12.5英里的
<5-6,Sheldon>at a secret military supercollider located beneath a fake agricultural station

178
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,950
<5-6,Sheldon>一个空设的农学院地下
<5-6,Sheldon>12.5 miles southeast of Traverse City,Michigan.

179
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,580
<5-6,Sheldon>我没告诉过你啊
<5-6,Sheldon>Which you did not hear about from me.

180
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,320
<5-7,Penny>你就别老记着我说过...
<5-7,Penny>Look,just forget I told you about me...

181
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,610
<5-7,Penny>社区大学没毕业 好吗?
<5-7,Penny>not graduating from community college,okay?

182
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,220
<5-8,Sheldon>别老记着? 这能忘得掉吗?
<5-8,Sheldon>Forget? You want me to forget?

183
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,700
<5-8,Sheldon>我这脑子 啥东西忘得掉啊!
<5-8,Sheldon>This mind does not forget.

184
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,050
<5-8,Sheldon>从我妈给我断奶后 我就没忘掉过一件事
<5-8,Sheldon>I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breastfeeding me.

185
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,410
<5-8,Sheldon>- 那天是周二 下着毛毛雨 - 好了...
<5-8,Sheldon>- It was a drizzly Tuesday. - Okay...

186
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,980
<5-9,Penny>你答应过我要保守秘密
<5-9,Penny>Look,you promised me you would keep my secret,

187
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,260
<5-9,Penny>那你就想个办法别漏嘴
<5-9,Penny>so you're just gonna have to figure out a way to do it.

188
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,720
<6-1,Sheldon (entering)>莱纳德我要搬出去
<6-1,Sheldon (entering)>Leonard,I'm moving out.

189
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,770
<6-2,Leonard>什么叫"要搬出去"? 为什么?
<6-2,Leonard>What do you mean you're moving out? Why?

190
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,690
<6-3,Sheldon>不一定非要有理由嘛
<6-3,Sheldon>There doesn't have to be a reason.

191
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,550
<6-4,Leonard>是啊 总该有吧
<6-4,Leonard>Yeah,there kinda does.

192
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,790
<6-5,Sheldon>不一定非得有
<6-5,Sheldon>Not necessarily.

193
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,670
<6-5,Sheldon>这是Munchausen三难推理的典型例子
<6-5,Sheldon>This is a classic example of Munchausen's Trilemma.

194
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,880
<6-5,Sheldon>要么就是 这个前提通过一系列 不断弱化的次前提 已经得到阐述
<6-5,Sheldon>Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression,

195
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,260
<6-5,Sheldon>要么就是 能从所谓偶然的公理陈述中 找到答案
<6-5,Sheldon>or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements,

196
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,700
<6-5,Sheldon>也有可能是终极循环
<6-5,Sheldon>or it's ultimately circular,

197
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,910
<6-5,Sheldon>也就是说 因为我要搬出去 所以我要搬出去
<6-5,Sheldon>i.e.I'm moving out because I'm moving out.

198
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,260
<6-6,Leonard>我还是不懂
<6-6,Leonard>I'm still confused.

199
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,620
<6-7,Sheldon>莱纳德我已经说得够明白的了
<6-7,Sheldon>Leonard,I don't see how I could have made it any simpler.

200
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,720
<6-8,Howard (entering)>嘿 伙计们 还好吗?(蹩脚法语)
<6-8,Howard (entering)>Hey,qu'est que s'up?

201
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,820
<6-9,Raj>我们刚去看了塑化人体标本展
<6-9,Raj>We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticized human cadavers.

202
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,050
<6-10,Howard>那些个没皮的小妞儿 真是辣哟!
<6-10,Howard>And some of those skinless chicks were Hot!

203
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,870
<6-11,Sheldon>抱歉 我得去收拾了
<6-11,Sheldon>If you'll excuse me,I'm going to pack.

204
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,930
<6-12,Howard>他对我单纯的恋尸癖 反应还真大
<6-12,Howard>That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.

205
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,350
<6-13,Leonard>霍华德 不关你事 他说他要搬出去
<6-13,Leonard>It's not you,Howard. He says he's moving out.

206
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,240
<6-14,Raj>你对他干了啥?
<6-14,Raj>What did you do?

207
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,870
<6-14,Raj>你改了电视机的对比度和亮度?
<6-14,Raj>Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?

208
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,470
<6-15,Leonard>没啊
<6-15,Leonard>No.

209
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,200
<6-16,Raj>你在他面前扒了创可贴?
<6-16,Raj>Did you take a Band-Aid off in front of him?

210
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,180
<6-17,Leonard>没
<6-17,Leonard>No.

211
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,700
<6-18,Howard>你买了三无番茄酱? 忘了洗水池?
<6-18,Howard>Did you buy generic ketchup,forget to rinse the sink,

212
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,680
<6-18,Howard>还是隔着厕所门同他讲话?
<6-18,Howard>talk to him through the bathroom door?

213
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,800
<6-19,Raj>调了恒温器? 煮菜放了芫荽叶? "t"那音总是忘了发?
<6-19,Raj>Adjust the thermostat,cook with cilantro,pronounce the "t" in often?

214
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,300
<6-20,Leonard>没有
<6-20,Leonard>No.

215
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,140
<6-21,Howard>你是不是拿火车开玩笑了?
<6-21,Howard>Did you make fun of trains?

216
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,370
<6-22,Leonard>没有 我啥都没干 他疯了
<6-22,Leonard>No,I didn't do anything. He's just gone insane.

217
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,430
<6-23,Raj>也是 这天迟早会来的
<6-23,Raj>Well,we all knew this day was coming.

218
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,730
<6-24,Leonard>你动作还真快
<6-24,Leonard>Well,that was fast.

219
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,830
<6-25,Sheldon>这是我早准备好的避难行囊
<6-25,Sheldon>It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag.

220
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,970
<6-25,Sheldon>国土安全部推荐的
<6-25,Sheldon>It's recommended by the Department of Homeland Security.

221
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,360
<6-25,Sheldon>还有莎拉·康纳 ("终结者"女主人公)
<6-25,Sheldon>And Sarah Connor.

222
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,810
<6-26,Leonard>你打算住哪儿?
<6-26,Leonard>Where are you going to live?

223
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,700
<6-27,Sheldon>在我找到寓所之前 我先在朋友家挤挤
<6-27,Sheldon>Until I find a permanent place,I will stay with friends.

224
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,970
<6-28,Howard>回见
<6-28,Howard>Bye.

225
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,190
<6-29,Raj>呃... 你不能住我那儿
<6-29,Raj>Well... you can't stay with me.

226
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,090
<6-29,Raj>我的公寓小得可怜
<6-29,Raj>I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

227
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,460
<6-30,Sheldon>广纳宾客不正是"向人致敬"的一部分吗?
<6-30,Sheldon>Excuse me,but isn't hosting guests an aspect of "manushya yajna,"

228
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,550
<6-30,Sheldon>"向人致敬"不是印度五大宗教戒规之一吗?
<6-30,Sheldon>one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

229
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,550
<6-31,Raj>我讨厌火车
<6-31,Raj>I hate trains.

230
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,130
<6-32,Sheldon>别开玩笑了 你可喜欢火车了
<6-32,Sheldon>Don't be ridiculous,you love trains.

231
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,040
<6-33,Raj>啊 没错 来吧
<6-33,Raj>Yes,I do. Come on.

232
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,140
<6-33,Raj>回见 莱纳德
<6-33,Raj>See you later,Leonard.

233
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,330
<6-34,Leonard>还真管用
<6-34,Leonard>This could work.

234
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,310
<7-1,Sheldon>这栋楼有年头了
<7-1,Sheldon>This is a very old building.

235
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,450
<7-2,Raj>造了六十年了 以前是手表厂
<7-2,Raj>60 years. It used to be a watch factory.

236
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,210
<7-4,Raj>怎么了?
<7-4,Raj>What?

237
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,570
<7-5,Sheldon>你不担心残留在发光表盘里的镭吗?
<7-5,Sheldon>Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?

238
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,590
<7-6,Raj>你干嘛要提!
<7-6,Raj>Not until now!

239
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,180
<7-7,Sheldon>我竟然没带盖格计数器 (用于测量放射性物质)
<7-7,Sheldon>I can't believe I didn't bring my Geiger counter.

240
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,360
<7-7,Sheldon>就在床头 我居然没拿
<7-7,Sheldon>I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it.

241
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,950
<7-8,Raj>那么... 谢尔顿 要是你觉得住着不舒服
<7-8,Raj>Well,if you're not comfortable staying here,Sheldon...

242
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,670
<7-9,Sheldon>我开玩笑的 我带来了
<7-9,Sheldon>I'm kidding,I packed it.

243
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,120
<7-9,Sheldon>是个笑话
<7-9,Sheldon>It was a joke.

244
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,070
<7-9,Sheldon>我就是要破坏你的语境期待
<7-9,Sheldon>I was subverting the conversational expectations.

245
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,050
<7-9,Sheldon>那叫啥来着 "出其不意"
<7-9,Sheldon>I believe they call that the,uh,ol' switcharoo.

246
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,480
<7-10,Raj>好极了
<7-10,Raj>Terrific.

247
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,330
<7-11,Sheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television)>那女的是艾维雅·瑞儿（印度当红影星）吗?
<7-11,Sheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television)>Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?

248
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,120
<7-12,Raj>是的 她是个很棒的演员吧
<7-12,Raj>Yes,isn't she an amazing actress?

249
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,730
<7-13,Sheldon>我倒觉得她是可怜虫心中的玛杜瑞·迪克西特 (印度90年代知名影星 后结婚生子)
<7-13,Sheldon>Actually,I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

250
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,980
<7-14,Raj>你敢再说一遍!
<7-14,Raj>How dare you!

251
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,150
<7-14,Raj>艾维雅·瑞儿是我的女神
<7-14,Raj>Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

252
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,780
<7-14,Raj>相比之下 玛杜瑞·迪克西特 就是得麻风病的妓女
<7-14,Raj>By comparison,Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

253
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,480
<7-15,Sheldon>对不起 我没想到会冒犯你
<7-15,Sheldon>Sorry,I didn't mean to offend you.

254
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,740
<7-15,Sheldon>显然你不了解印度电影
<7-15,Sheldon>Obviously,you're not that familiar with Indian cinema.

255
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,120
<8-1,Howard>谁啊?
<8-1,Howard>Who is it?

256
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,660
<8-1,Howard>脱衣舞娘来喽!
<8-1,Howard>Stripper-Gram!

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,510
<8-3,Raj>交给你了
<8-3,Raj>Tag,you're It.

258
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,670
<8-4,Howard>你就不能把他塞进牛皮纸袋里 烧了算了?
<8-4,Howard>Shouldn't you put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?

259
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,670
<8-4,Howard>我从来没睡过气垫床
<8-4,Howard>I've never slept on an air mattress before.

260
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,040
<9-1,Sheldon>腰部都没东西撑着
<9-1,Sheldon>No lumbar support whatsoever.

261
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,200
<9-2,Howard>你大概是想睡公园的长椅上是吧
<9-2,Howard>Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench.

262
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,750
<9-3,Sheldon>我认为 你没有办法把长椅弄到这儿来
<9-3,Sheldon>I don't see any way to get a park bench in here.

263
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,420
<9-4,Howard>要换一下吗?
<9-4,Howard>Do you want to switch?

264
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,780
<9-5,Sheldon>不用了 这样挺好
<9-5,Sheldon>No,that's fine.

265
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,470
<9-5,Sheldon>睡在充气城堡上可舒服呢
<9-5,Sheldon>I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.

266
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,860
<9-6,Howard>下床来 我和你换
<9-6,Howard>Get out of bed. We're switching.

267
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,040
<9-7,Sheldon>- 我没逼着你换 - 快下床!
<9-7,Sheldon>- Now,only if you want to. - Just get in the bed!

268
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,310
<9-8,Howard>这是怎么了?
<9-8,Howard>What's going on?

269
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,880
<9-9,Howard’s mother (off)>你们两个臭小子 闹什么闹?
<9-9,Howard’s mother (off)>Are you boys roughhousing?

270
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,570
<9-10,Howard>老妈 我们只是在聊天!
<9-10,Howard>We're just talking,Ma!

271
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,120
<9-11,Howard’s mother>要是你们再不给我安生点
<9-11,Howard’s mother>If you don't settle down right now,

272
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,120
<9-11,Howard’s mother>看我以后还让不让你去朋友家过夜!
<9-11,Howard’s mother>I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers!

273
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,960
<9-12,Howard>老天啊 老妈 我都27了!
<9-12,Howard>For God's sake,Ma,I'm 27 years old!

274
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,440
<9-12,Howard>明天又不上学!
<9-12,Howard>And it's not even a school night!

275
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,790
<9-12,Howard>舒服了吧?
<9-12,Howard>Comfy now?

276
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,040
<9-13,Sheldon>那张哈莉·贝瑞(好莱坞女星 曾出演猫女)的海报让我有点紧张
<9-13,Sheldon>That poster of Halle Berry is a little unnerving.

277
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,690
<9-14,Howard>别看就是了
<9-14,Howard>So don't look at it.

278
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,790
<9-15,Sheldon>她是我第四爱的猫女郎
<9-15,Sheldon>She's like my fourth favorite Catwoman.

279
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,620
<9-16,Howard>不是吧
<9-16,Howard>No kidding.

280
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,350
<9-17,Sheldon>对 前三个是朱莉·纽曼 米切尔·菲佛尔 和伊尔特·基特
<9-17,Sheldon>Yeah,Julie Newmar,Michelle Pfieffer,Eartha Kitt,and then her.

281
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,070
<9-18,Howard>李·梅里韦瑟呢?
<9-18,Howard>What about Lee Merriweather?

282
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,920
<9-19,Sheldon>噢 我把她忘了
<9-19,Sheldon>Oh,I forgot about Lee Merriweather.

283
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,750
<9-20,Howard>好吧 终于搞定了
<9-20,Howard>Well,I'm glad that's settled.

284
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,890
<9-21,Sheldon>那哈莉·贝瑞只能排第五了
<9-21,Sheldon>That makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite Catwoman.

285
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,930
<9-21,Sheldon>朱莉·纽曼  米切尔·菲佛尔 伊尔特·基特  李·梅里韦瑟...
<9-21,Sheldon>It's Julie Newmar,Michelle Pfieffer,Eartha Kitt,Lee Merriweather--

286
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,230
<9-22,Howard>求求你了 睡觉吧
<9-22,Howard>Please,I'm begging you. Go to sleep.

287
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,660
<9-23,Sheldon>我在努力嘛 都在数猫女郎了
<9-23,Sheldon>I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.

288
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,550
<9-23,Sheldon>她在X战警里演的变种人倒是不赖
<9-23,Sheldon>She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies,though.

289
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,520
<9-24,Howard>噢 我求求你了
<9-24,Howard>Oh,for God's sake.

290
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,830
<9-25,Sheldon>X战警里我最喜欢的不是她
<9-25,Sheldon>She's not my favorite of the X-Men.

291
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,090
<9-25,Sheldon>要排序的话应该是:金钢狼 雷射眼
<9-25,Sheldon>In order that would be: Wolverine,Cyclops--

292
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,650
<9-25,Sheldon>噢 等等 我忘了X教授
<9-25,Sheldon>Oh,wait,I forgot Professor X.

293
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,020
<9-25,Sheldon>X教授 金钢狼 雷射眼 冰人 然后是暴风女 天使 还有野兽
<9-25,Sheldon>Professor X,Wolverine,Cyclops,Iceman,then Storm,Angel,the Beast--

294
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,060
<9-25,Sheldon>不对 等等 还有蓝魔人
<9-25,Sheldon>No,wait,Nightcrawler.

295
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,270
<9-25,Sheldon>X教授 蓝魔人 金钢狼 雷射眼 冰人 暴风女 天使...
<9-25,Sheldon>Professor X,Nightcrawler,Wolverine,Cyclops,Iceman,then Storm,Angel...

296
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,880
<10-1,Leonard>来了!
<10-1,Leonard>I'm coming!

297
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,670
<10-2,Sheldon>是他 我的老-伙-计
<10-2,Sheldon>There he is. There my old buddy bud bud.

298
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,020
<10-3,Leonard>他是怎么了?
<10-3,Leonard>What's with him?

299
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,530
<10-4,Howard>Koothrappali把他扔给了我 他睡不着觉
<10-4,Howard>Koothrappali dumped him on me,and he couldn't get to sleep,

300
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,350
<10-4,Howard>所以我给他倒了杯温牛奶 里面放了一把我妈的安眠药
<10-4,Howard>so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's Valium in it...

301
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,050
<10-4,Howard>可他还是不肯住嘴 得了 还给你吧
<10-4,Howard>but he still wouldn't shut up,so tag,you're It.

302
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,750
<10-5,Sheldon>我回...来了
<10-5,Sheldon>I'm ba-a-a-ack.

303
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,950
<10-6,Leonard>我还是不知道你为啥要走
<10-6,Leonard>I still don't know why you left.

304
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,240
<10-7,Sheldon>不能告诉你
<10-7,Sheldon>I can't tell you.

305
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,560
<10-8,Leonard>为什么?
<10-8,Leonard>Why not?

306
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,670
<10-9,Sheldon>我答应过佩妮
<10-9,Sheldon>I promised Penny.

307
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,250
<10-10,Leonard>你答应她什么了?
<10-10,Leonard>You promised Penny what?

308
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,520
<10-11,Sheldon>我答应她保密啊
<10-11,Sheldon>I wouldn't tell you the secret.

309
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,000
<10-12,Leonard>什么秘密? 快告诉我
<10-12,Leonard>What secret? Tell me the secret.

310
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,540
<10-13,Sheldon>老妈在车里抽烟
<10-13,Sheldon>Mom smokes in the car.

311
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,650
<10-13,Sheldon>耶稣觉得没问题 不过不能告诉老爸
<10-13,Sheldon>Jesus is okay with it but we can't tell Dad.

312
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,700
<10-14,Leonard>不是这个 另一个秘密
<10-14,Leonard>Not that secret. The other secret.

313
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,710
<10-15,Sheldon>- 我是蝙蝠侠 嘘! - 我靠! 谢尔顿!
<10-15,Sheldon>- I'm Batman-- Shh! - Damn it! Sheldon!

314
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,020
<10-16,Leonard>你说 佩妮跟你说了个秘密 什么秘密?
<10-16,Leonard>You said Penny told you a secret. What's the secret?

315
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,050
<10-17,Sheldon>好吧 我告诉你 不过你不能告诉莱纳德
<10-17,Sheldon>Okay,I'll tell you,but you can't tell Leonard.

316
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,260
<10-18,Leonard>我保证
<10-18,Leonard>I promise.

317
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,030
<10-19,Sheldon>佩妮说她是社区大学毕业 其实没这回事
<10-19,Sheldon>Penny lied about graduating from community college

318
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,120
<10-19,Sheldon>因为她怕自己不够聪明 配不上莱纳德
<10-19,Sheldon>'cause she's afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard.

319
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,850
<10-20,Leonard>不是我做错什么了? 是她的问题?
<10-20,Leonard>So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?

320
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,150
<10-21,Sheldon>我喝了杯牛奶 味道真好玩儿
<10-21,Sheldon>I drank milk that tasted funny.

321
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,040
<10-22,Leonard>佩妮觉得我太聪明 这也太搞笑了
<10-22,Leonard>Penny thinks I'm too smart for her. That's ridiculous.

322
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,660
<10-22,Leonard>我明白
<10-22,Leonard>I know.

323
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,320
<10-23,Sheldon>你的大部分工作 都不是原创的
<10-23,Sheldon>Most of your work is extremely derivative.

324
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,250
<10-23,Sheldon>别担心 这就不是秘密了
<10-23,Sheldon>And don't worry,that's not a secret.

325
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,170
<10-23,Sheldon>谁都知道
<10-23,Sheldon>Everybody knows.

326
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,710
<11-2,Leonard>听着 我已经知道我们之间的问题了 我也有了解决方案
<11-2,Leonard>Listen,I know what's been bothering you about us,and I have the answer.

327
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,650
<11-3,Penny>你在说什么?
<11-3,Penny>What are you talking about?

328
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,360
<11-4,Leonard>好的 首先 这不是谢尔顿的错
<11-4,Leonard>Okay,first,I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault.

329
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,330
<11-4,Leonard>他已经很努力地替你保密了
<11-4,Leonard>He tried very hard to keep your secret.

330
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,280
<11-4,Leonard>要不是霍华德给他灌了安眠药 他是不会自掘坟墓的
<11-4,Leonard>If Howard hadn't drugged him,he would've taken it to his grave.
