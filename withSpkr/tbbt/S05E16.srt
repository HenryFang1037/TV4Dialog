<1-24,Seibert>你不肯休假
<1-24,Seibert>you're refusing to take your vacation.

51
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,370
<1-26,Seibert>就擅自给我装的建议箱里  收到的最多的建议就是
<1-26,Seibert>suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me

52
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,610
<1-26,Seibert>"能不能让库珀博士去休假呀"
<1-26,Seibert>is "Can Dr. Cooper take a vacation?"

53
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,420
<1-26,Seibert>好吧  问题解决  那咱们就周一见咯
<1-26,Seibert>Okay, settled, then. I'll see y'all of you Monday,

98
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,010
<2-14,Sheldon>我知道你掉头了
<2-14,Sheldon>I know you turned around.

<3-4,Bernadette>你是说我的大日子吧
<3-4,Bernadette>You mean my special day?

00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,850
<3-6,Bernadette>如果我真的能结成婚
<3-6,Bernadette>If I ever actually ever get married.

110
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,970
<3-7,Penny>为什么结不成
<3-7,Penny>Why wouldn't you?

111
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,290
<3-8,Bernadette>因为我爸呗
<3-8,Bernadette>My dad...

112
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,120
<3-8,Bernadette>我挣得钱比华仔多
<3-8,Bernadette>'Cause I make a lot more money than Howie,

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,460
<3-8,Bernadette>所以我老爸逼我签订一个婚前协议
<3-8,Bernadette>he's putting a lot of pressure on me to get a prenup.

114
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,790
<3-9,Penny>这可不妙
<3-9,Penny>Ouch.

115
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,300
<3-10,Bernadette>是啊  华仔会抓狂的
<3-10,Bernadette>Yeah. Howie's gonna freak out.

116
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,030
<3-11,Amy>来自父母的压力还真是可怕
<3-11,Amy>Parental pressure can be daunting.

117
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,160
<3-11,Amy>记得我以前因为不愿刮腿毛而跟我妈吵架
<3-11,Amy>I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs.

118
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,120
<3-11,Amy>去年我终于举腿投降  让她把我刮了
<3-11,Amy>Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.

119
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,940
<3-12,Bernadette>我真不知道该怎么跟他说这件事
<3-12,Bernadette>I just don't know how I'm gonna break it to him.

120
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,110
<3-13,Penny>我坚信向男人宣布坏消息的最好时机
<3-13,Penny>You know, I'm a big believer in breaking bad news

121
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,410
<3-13,Penny>就是跟他在床上的时候
<3-13,Penny>to a guy when you're in bed with him.

122
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,970
<3-13,Penny>我就是这么告诉我高中男友
<3-13,Penny>That's how I told my high school boyfriend

123
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,520
<3-13,Penny>我跟他哥上床的事情
<3-13,Penny>I slept with his brother.

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,190
<3-13,Penny>然后场景不变  再把主角换成他哥
<3-13,Penny>That's how I told his brother the same thing.

125
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,590
<3-14,Bernadette>我不知道  可我不想用性来操纵他
<3-14,Bernadette>I don't know, I don't want to manipulate him with sex.

126
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,630
<3-15,Penny>亲爱的  这才是性的用处所在
<3-15,Penny>Oh, sweetie, that's what sex is for.

127
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,970
<3-16,Amy>其实婚姻和金钱的联系  早在过去便如此
<3-16,Amy>You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new.

128
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,030
<3-16,Amy>"结婚"一词在过去就是指
<3-16,Amy>In fact, the term "wed" referred to the money and livestock

129
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,970
<3-16,Amy>新郎付给岳父的金钱和牲畜
<3-16,Amy>that the groom paid the bride's father.

130
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,700
<3-16,Amy>比如
<3-16,Amy>For example,

131
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,980
<3-16,Amy>如果你长得标致
<3-16,Amy>you're adorable,

132
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,610
<3-16,Amy>聪明伶俐又会挣钱
<3-16,Amy>intelligent and a good earner.

133
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,510
<3-16,Amy>保守地说  你也能得到
<3-16,Amy>I could conservatively see you going for

134
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,510
<3-16,Amy>至少两头牛和一只鹅
<3-16,Amy>at least two oxen and a goose.

135
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,390
<3-16,Amy>而你  绝对能收到一头独角兽
<3-16,Amy>You would fetch a unicorn.

136
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,320
<4-1,Leonard>谢尔顿  有很多度假胜地你可以去
<4-1,Leonard>Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take.

137
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,570
<4-1,Leonard>夏威夷怎么样
<4-1,Leonard>What about Hawaii?

139
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,660
<4-2,Sheldon>夏威夷就是昔日坐落在活火山上的麻风病人隔离区
<4-2,Sheldon>Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano

140
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,460
<4-2,Sheldon>《迷失》的烂结局也是在那里拍的
<4-2,Sheldon>where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed.

142
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,620
<4-2,Sheldon>真他妈感谢你  夏威夷
<4-2,Sheldon>Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.

143
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,740
<4-3,Howard>那佛罗里达呢
<4-3,Howard>How about Florida?

144
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,110
<4-3,Howard>那里有卡纳维拉尔角
<4-3,Howard>They got Cape Canaveral,

146
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,510
<4-3,Howard>她集了世界上最全的糖尿病患吃的糖果
<4-3,Howard>and the world's largest collection of diabetic candy.

147
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,280
<4-3,Howard>而且  你要是汗出得够多
<4-3,Howard>Plus, if you get sweaty enough,

148
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,230
<4-3,Howard>还可以用她的塑料膜沙发玩激流勇进
<4-3,Howard>her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.

149
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,600
<4-4,Sheldon>小时候俺家去佛罗里达旅行过一次
<4-4,Sheldon>My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child.

150
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,980
<4-4,Sheldon>在沙滩上  一只海鸥偷了我一条热狗
<4-4,Sheldon>A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach.

151
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,860
<4-4,Sheldon>我就知道这儿不欢迎我
<4-4,Sheldon>I got the message.

152
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,340
<4-5,Raj>我要是能放一周假
<4-5,Raj>You know, if I had a week off, I'd go back

153
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,720
<4-5,Raj>我会再去沙漠温泉酒店
<4-5,Raj>to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert.

154
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,600
<4-5,Raj>告诉你们  让特雷弗给你按摩一小时
<4-5,Raj>I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor,

155
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,740
<4-5,Raj>你会酥软到觉得自己生来就没骨头
<4-5,Raj>and you'll feel like you were born without bones.

156
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,340
<4-6,Howard>我估计受不了一个男的给我按摩
<4-6,Howard>I don't think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.

157
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,890
<4-7,Raj>是吗  那昨晚你玩X-BOX的时候
<4-7,Raj>Really? What was I doing to your neck last night

158
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,630
<4-7,Raj>我在给你的脖子做什么
<4-7,Raj>while you were playing X-Box?

159
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,980
<4-8,Sheldon>感觉我就像生活在独裁之中
<4-8,Sheldon>It's like I'm living in a dictatorship.

160
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,520
<4-8,Sheldon>"你一定要去度假  你一定要开心
<4-8,Sheldon>"You must take a vacation, you must have fun,

161
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,080
<4-8,Sheldon>你一定要享受生活"
<4-8,Sheldon>you must enjoy life."

162
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,520
<4-9,Howard>你好像误解了独裁的意思吧
<4-9,Howard>I don't think you have a good handle on dictatorships.

163
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,630
<4-10,Leonard>谢尔顿  每个人都需要休假
<4-10,Leonard>Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.

164
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,300
<4-11,Sheldon>理查德·费曼以前也被逼着休假
<4-11,Sheldon>One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation,

165
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,630
<4-11,Sheldon>可他选择拓宽思维
<4-11,Sheldon>but he chose instead to expand his mind

166
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,870
<4-11,Sheldon>学一些新知识
<4-11,Sheldon>and learn something new.

167
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,270
<4-11,Sheldon>他去了朋友的生物实验室工作
<4-11,Sheldon>He went to work in his friend's biology lab.

168
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,170
<4-11,Sheldon>理查德·费曼是美国著名的物理学家
<4-11,Sheldon>Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist,

169
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,710
<4-11,Sheldon>曼哈顿工程  是第二次世界大战期间
<4-11,Sheldon>盎格鲁国家秘密研发原子弹项目的代号

170
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,710
<4-11,Sheldon>参与过曼哈顿工程
<4-11,Sheldon>part of the Manhattan Project.

171
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,210
<4-12,Howard>科学界的人都知道理查德·费曼是谁
<4-12,Howard>Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.

172
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,680
<4-13,Sheldon>你是现在才知道的吧
<4-13,Sheldon>Now you do, too.

173
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
<4-13,Sheldon>我想到了一个绝妙的主意
<4-13,Sheldon>Oh! I have a brilliant idea.

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,150
<4-13,Sheldon>艾米是生物学家  我可以去她的实验室工作
<4-13,Sheldon>Amy's a biologist. I'll go work in her lab.

175
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,720
<4-14,Howard>这不就是费曼的主意吗
<4-14,Howard>Isn't that just Feynman's idea?

176
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,000
<4-15,Sheldon>几秒钟前你还没听说过他
<4-15,Sheldon>Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,500
<4-15,Sheldon>现在就装起专家来了
<4-15,Sheldon>Now you're an expert.

178
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,350
<5-2,Penny>-这么巧  -这是要洗的衣服吗
<5-2,Penny>- Hey, you. - Is that your laundry?

179
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,930
<5-3,Leonard>怎么才这么几件
<5-3,Leonard>You only have, like, six things in there.

180
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,300
<5-4,Penny>我没有零钱了
<5-4,Penny>Yeah, I didn't have any quarters,

181
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,000
<5-4,Penny>所以一直偷偷把衣服塞到别人的衣服堆里
<5-4,Penny>so I've been sneaking stuff into other people's loads all day.

182
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,370
<5-4,Penny>如果我告诉你一件事
<5-4,Penny>Hey, if I tell you something,

183
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,240
<5-4,Penny>你能保证不告诉别人吗
<5-4,Penny>will you promise not to tell anybody?

184
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,380
<5-5,Leonard>我说什么无所谓  反正你也会告诉我
<5-5,Leonard>It doesn't matter what I say, you're gonna tell me anyway.

185
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,850
<5-6,Penny>什么  才没有这回事
<5-6,Penny>What? That is not true.

186
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,490
<5-6,Penny>伯纳黛特想签婚前协议
<5-6,Penny>Bernadette wants a prenup.

187
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,020
<5-7,Leonard>这事过分了吧
<5-7,Leonard>Wow. That's rough.

188
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,890
<5-8,Penny>这么说如果我成了著名影星
<5-8,Penny>So you're saying if I became a famous movie star,

189
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,760
<5-8,Penny>我们结婚的话  你不会签婚前协议吗
<5-8,Penny>we got married, you wouldn't sign a prenup?

190
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,430
<5-9,Leonard>绝对不会
<5-9,Leonard>Absolutely not.

191
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,640
<5-9,Leonard>如果我要待在家里带孩子
<5-9,Leonard>If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids

192
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,020
<5-9,Leonard>而你在出外景
<5-9,Leonard>while you're on location

194
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,050
<5-9,Leonard>跟瑞安·高斯林玩偷吃
<5-9,Leonard>cheating on me with Ryan Gosling...

195
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,900
<5-9,Leonard>那莱纳德就不是这么好打发的了
<5-9,Leonard>then Leonard gots to get paid.

196
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,210
<5-9,Leonard>你想过我们结婚吗
<5-9,Leonard>So, you think about us getting married?

197
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,010
<5-10,Penny>我想的东西可多了
<5-10,Penny>I think about a lot of things.

198
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,410
<5-10,Penny>我会想我们结婚
<5-10,Penny>I think about us getting married,

199
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,780
<5-10,Penny>我也会想我们分手
<5-10,Penny>I think about us breaking up.

200
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,410
<5-10,Penny>有时  我还想
<5-10,Penny>Once in a while, I think about

201
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,910
<5-10,Penny>自己上个月在停车场
<5-10,Penny>how I didn't leave a note on that Mercedes

202
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,570
<5-10,Penny>撞了人家的奔驰没留字条
<5-10,Penny>I dinged in the parking lot last month,

203
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,010
<5-10,Penny>不过喝杯酒就抛到九霄云外了
<5-10,Penny>but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.

204
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,390
<5-11,Leonard>随你怎么说笑  但你还是想了
<5-11,Leonard>Joke all you want, but you think about it.

205
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,420
<5-12,Penny>告诉你一件事
<5-12,Penny>Well, tell you one thing,

206
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,630
<5-12,Penny>我要是真要结婚了  绝对不用克林贡语写喜帖
<5-12,Penny>if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.

207
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,090
<5-13,Leonard>祝你能用这态度去抓住男人的心
<5-13,Leonard>Good luck catching a man with that attitude.

208
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,140
<6-1,Sheldon>哎哟喂
<6-1,Sheldon>Boy, oh, boy!

209
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,020
<6-1,Sheldon>这次度假有了个美好的开端
<6-1,Sheldon>This vacation is off to a wonderful start.

210
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,910
<6-1,Sheldon>甲醛的气味
<6-1,Sheldon>The smell of formaldehyde...

211
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,240
<6-1,Sheldon>离心机的嗡嗡声
<6-1,Sheldon>the whir of the centrifuge,

212
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,280
<6-1,Sheldon>被送去解剖的实验室动物
<6-1,Sheldon>the distant chatter of lab animals

213
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,140
<6-1,Sheldon>那渐渐远去的叫喊声
<6-1,Sheldon>being dispatched for dissection.

214
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,220
<6-1,Sheldon>我觉得自己的担心在慢慢消逝
<6-1,Sheldon>Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.

215
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,340
<6-2,Amy>我很高兴能和自己的男朋友公事
<6-2,Amy>I'm excited to work with my boyfriend.

216
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,900
<6-2,Amy>肯定很浪漫
<6-2,Amy>It's gonna be romantic.

217
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,520
<6-3,Sheldon>真会扫兴
<6-3,Sheldon>Way to kill the mood.

218
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,130
<6-4,Amy>别这么说  谢尔顿
<6-4,Amy>Come on, Sheldon.

219
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,830
<6-4,Amy>我们可以像玛丽·居里和她丈夫皮埃尔那样
<6-4,Amy>We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre,

220
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,100
<6-4,Amy>他们日夜并肩工作
<6-4,Amy>who spent their days working side by side,

221
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
<6-4,Amy>沐浴在爱和镭的光辉下
<6-4,Amy>bathed in the glow of their love and the radium

222
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,250
<6-4,Amy>那玩意儿最终还要了她的命
<6-4,Amy>that ultimately killed her.

223
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,700
<6-4,Amy>《美女与野兽》弱爆了
<6-4,Amy>Screw Beauty and the Beast;

224
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,980
<6-4,Amy>这才是迪士尼应该拍的爱情故事
<6-4,Amy>that's the love story Disney should tell.

225
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,680
<6-5,Sheldon>好吧  我们从什么开始呢
<6-5,Sheldon>Okay, what do we start with?

226
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,050
<6-5,Sheldon>要不拼接一些基因  克隆一只羊
<6-5,Sheldon>Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep,

227
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,200
<6-5,Sheldon>或者在一只老鼠背上植个人耳
<6-5,Sheldon>perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse's back?

228
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,900
<6-5,Sheldon>哈哈  我是个怪胎
<6-5,Sheldon>Ha-ha, I'm a freak!

229
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,050
<6-6,Amy>我准备做一些脑干组织的实验
<6-6,Amy>Oh, I'm gonna be doing some brain stem histology

230
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,280
<6-6,Amy>你可以用那块海绵
<6-6,Amy>while you put yourself on the business end

231
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,770
<6-6,Amy>洗那些烧杯
<6-6,Amy>of a sponge and wash those beakers.

232
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,270
<6-7,Sheldon>洗烧杯
<6-7,Sheldon>Wash those bea...

233
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,290
<6-7,Sheldon>我明白了  欺负新来的是吧
<6-7,Sheldon>Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella.

234
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,230
<6-7,Sheldon>我还得眼睛睁大点
<6-7,Sheldon>Yeah, I'd better keep an eye out for, what,

235
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,680
<6-7,Sheldon>小心显微镜上有鞋油
<6-7,Sheldon>shoe polish on the microscope,

236
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,430
<6-7,Sheldon>烤芝士三明治里有疯牛病菌  是吧
<6-7,Sheldon>or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?

237
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,140
<6-8,Amy>不是  我真的要用干净的烧杯
<6-8,Amy>No, I just need those beakers washed.

238
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,580
<6-8,Amy>小兔子乖乖  赶紧干活了
<6-8,Amy>Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.

239
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,550
<6-9,Sheldon>拜托  大名鼎鼎的谢尔顿博士在你实验室呢
<6-9,Sheldon>Wha...? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab.

240
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,880
<6-9,Sheldon>你就让他做洗碗的工作啊
<6-9,Sheldon>You're gonna make him do the dishes?

241
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,420
<6-9,Sheldon>那不等于叫绿巨人
<6-9,Sheldon>That's like asking the Incredible Hulk

242
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,040
<6-9,Sheldon>去开泡菜罐头嘛
<6-9,Sheldon>to open a pickle jar.

243
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,290
<6-10,Amy>谢尔顿  你从没在生物实验室工作过
<6-10,Amy>Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab like this before.

244
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,890
<6-10,Amy>你对生物领域毫无经验
<6-10,Amy>You have no experience in the field of biology.

245
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,330
<6-11,Sheldon>我对生物的经验可多了
<6-11,Sheldon>I have plenty of experience in biology.

246
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,760
<6-11,Sheldon>我1998年买了个电子宠物鸡
<6-11,Sheldon>I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998.

247
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,370
<6-11,Sheldon>瞧
<6-11,Sheldon>And...

248
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,840
<6-11,Sheldon>它还活着呢
<6-11,Sheldon>it's still alive.

249
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,270
<6-11,Sheldon>所以没问题了吧
<6-11,Sheldon>Let's do this.

250
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,090
<7-2,Raj>-霍华德呢  -招呼都懒得打吗
<7-2,Raj>- Where's Howard? - No "Hi, Raj"?

251
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,690
<7-2,Raj>也不问我今天过得怎么样
<7-2,Raj>No "How are you, Raj?"

252
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,080
<7-2,Raj>一开口就问另一个白人在哪儿
<7-2,Raj>Just straight to "Where's the other white guy?"

253
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,430
<7-2,Raj>抱歉
<7-2,Raj>I'm sorry.

254
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,360
<7-3,Leonard>听着  我听说了点关于他的事
<7-3,Leonard>So, listen, I heard something about him.

255
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,100
<7-3,Leonard>你能保密吗
<7-3,Leonard>Can you keep it between us?

256
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,500
<7-4,Raj>哎哟  八卦
<7-4,Raj>Ooh, gossip.

257
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,870
<7-4,Raj>我刚来这的时候  我以为你们美国人
<7-4,Raj>When I first got here, I thought you Americans

258
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,570
<7-4,Raj>真的只在冷水机旁说八卦呢
<7-4,Raj>really gossiped around the water cooler.

259
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,540
<7-4,Raj>所以我去那边转悠了大概一个月
<7-4,Raj>So I hung out there for, like, a month,

260
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,700
<7-4,Raj>但我唯一听到的八卦就是  有个诡异的家伙
<7-4,Raj>but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy

261
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,420
<7-4,Raj>总是围着冷水机瞎转悠
<7-4,Raj>hanging out by the water cooler.

262
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,990
<7-5,Leonard>伯纳黛特想要签婚前协议
<7-5,Leonard>Bernadette wants to get a prenup.

263
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,710
<7-6,Raj>这太丢脸了  他肯定会悲痛欲绝的
<7-6,Raj>Oh, that's a shame-- he's gonna be devastated.

264
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,820
<7-7,Leonard>我对处理这种情况没有经验
<7-7,Leonard>I never know what to do in these situations.

265
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,220
<7-7,Leonard>我该给他点建议吗
<7-7,Leonard>Should I give him a heads-up?

266
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,760
<7-8,Raj>我给你的建议就跟我看真人秀《单身汉》的一样
<7-8,Raj>Hmm. I'm gonna give you the same advice

267
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,900
<7-8,Raj>当那些男人拿着玫瑰不知送给谁时  我就会嚷
<7-8,Raj>I yell at the TV when the Bachelor's handing out roses.

268
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,580
<7-8,Raj>随心所愿
<7-8,Raj>Follow your heart.

269
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,830
<7-9,Howard>快瞧瞧
<7-9,Howard>Check it out.

270
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,570
<7-9,Howard>看这份超大米花糖
<7-9,Howard>Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat!

271
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,580
<7-9,Howard>价钱一样哦
<7-9,Howard>Same price.

272
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,980
<7-10,Leonard>霍华德  我得告诉你点事
<7-10,Leonard>Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.

273
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,810
<7-11,Howard>我知道  结婚前不该吃这些
<7-11,Howard>I know, it's not on my wedding diet.

274
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,540
<7-11,Howard>我不在乎
<7-11,Howard>I don't care.

275
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,550
<7-12,Leonard>听着
<7-12,Leonard>Uh, l-listen, I...

276
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,930
<7-12,Leonard>我听说伯纳黛特想要你签婚前协议
<7-12,Leonard>heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a prenup.

277
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,460
<7-13,Howard>婚前协议
<7-13,Howard>A prenup?

278
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
<7-14,Leonard>你要怎么办
<7-14,Leonard>What are you gonna do?

279
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,670
<7-15,Howard>我不知道
<7-15,Howard>I... don't know.

280
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,200
<7-16,Raj>随心所愿
<7-16,Raj>Follow your heart.

281
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,230
<7-17,Howard>其实  这也没什么
<7-17,Howard>You know what, it's... not a big deal.

282
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,510
<7-17,Howard>她赚的钱比我多
<7-17,Howard>She makes more money than me.

283
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,140
<7-17,Howard>她想要保护自己的经济利益
<7-17,Howard>She wants to protect her financial interests.

284
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,950
<7-17,Howard>这完全合理
<7-17,Howard>It's completely reasonable.

285
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,390
<7-17,Howard>很好  你这心态不错
<7-17,Howard>Good. That's a healthy attitude.

286
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,390
<7-18,Howard>其实  这对我们两个都好
<7-18,Howard>Yeah, actually, it's good for both of us.

287
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,890
<7-18,Howard>我也有要保护的财产
<7-18,Howard>I have assets to protect, too.

288
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,250
<7-19,Raj>是吗  比如呢
<7-19,Raj>Like what?

289
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,240
<7-20,Howard>我有些很珍贵的漫画书
<7-20,Howard>I've got some rare comic books.

290
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,780
<7-20,Howard>那辆卫士摩托的贷款也快还清了
<7-20,Howard>The Vespa's almost paid off.

291
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,800
<7-20,Howard>我和妈在西奈山优先订了一个双人墓
<7-20,Howard>And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai

292
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,970
<7-20,Howard>就在那个演过《三人行》里罗柏先生的人旁边
<7-20,Howard>right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three's Company.

293
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,060
<7-21,Raj>罗柏先生死了吗
<7-21,Raj>Mr. Roper's dead?!

294
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,450
<7-21,Raj>你怎么能人家在毫无心理准备下说出来呢
<7-21,Raj>You can't just spring that on a guy!

295
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,750
<8-1,Sheldon>给
<8-1,Sheldon>Here you go.

296
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,620
<8-1,Sheldon>这件实验室里的玻璃器皿
<8-1,Sheldon>This is now the only lab

297
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,320
<8-1,Sheldon>可是独一无二  因为它们被个有双博士学位
<8-1,Sheldon>with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates

299
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,970
<8-1,Sheldon>和一张卡尔·萨根签过的禁止令的人洗过
<8-1,Sheldon>and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.

300
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,600
<8-2,Amy>有肥皂泡  重新洗
<8-2,Amy>Soap spots. Wash 'em again.

301
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,490
<8-3,Sheldon>胡说八道
<8-3,Sheldon>Y... You're being ridiculous!

302
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,560
<8-3,Sheldon>这些器皿彻底洗干净了
<8-3,Sheldon>Those are perfectly clean.

303
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,500
<8-4,Amy>谢尔顿  这个量杯盛过
<8-4,Amy>Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid

304
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,740
<8-4,Amy>死于梅毒的大象的脑脊液
<8-4,Amy>from an elephant that died of syphilis.

305
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,370
<8-4,Amy>如果真的彻底干净了
<8-4,Amy>If it's, in fact, perfectly clean,

306
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,720
<8-4,Amy>你敢拿去倒水喝吗
<8-4,Amy>drink from it.

307
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,460
<8-5,Sheldon>生物学家好刻薄
<8-5,Sheldon>Biologists are mean.

308
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,280
<8-6,Amy>好了  这个任务可能有点超出了你的能力
<8-6,Amy>All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley.

309
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,160
<8-6,Amy>我要你数清这些培养皿里的细菌孢子
<8-6,Amy>I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.

310
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,320
<8-7,Sheldon>那个清洁剂有问题
<8-7,Sheldon>There was something wrong with that detergent.

311
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,080
<8-7,Sheldon>有好多泡泡
<8-7,Sheldon>That was way too bubbly.

312
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,290
<8-9,Sheldon>-我想是吧  -我准备写一封
<8-9,Sheldon>- I'm sure it was. - I intend to write

313
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,590
<8-9,Sheldon>措辞强力的投诉信给肥皂公司
<8-9,Sheldon>that soap company a strongly worded letter.

314
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,600
<8-10,Amy>好吧  不错  现在开始数吧
<8-10,Amy>Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.

315
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
<8-11,Sheldon>知道这地方需要什么东西吗
<8-11,Sheldon>You know what this place needs?

316
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,250
<8-11,Sheldon>建议箱
<8-11,Sheldon>A suggestion box.

317
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,780
<8-12,Sheldon>三百六十六
<8-12,Sheldon>366...

318
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,740
<8-12,Sheldon>三百六十七
<8-12,Sheldon>367...

319
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,180
<8-13,Amy>怎么样了
<8-13,Amy>How's it going?

320
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,520
<8-14,Sheldon>你是说数数吗
<8-14,Sheldon>How's counting going?

321
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,970
<8-14,Sheldon>我还在上幼儿园的时候
<8-14,Sheldon>When I was in kindergarten,

322
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,940
<8-14,Sheldon>我在学校才艺展示上背了圆周率小数点后的一千位
<8-14,Sheldon>I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show.

323
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,270
<8-14,Sheldon>-我想这难不倒我  -很好
<8-14,Sheldon>- I think I got this.  - Great.

324
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,730
<8-16,Sheldon>我擦
<8-16,Sheldon>Aw, nuts!

325
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,010
<8-16,Sheldon>一
<8-16,Sheldon>One...

326
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,020
<8-17,Sheldon>这太可笑了
<8-17,Sheldon>This is preposterous!

327
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,640
<8-17,Sheldon>你一直让我做这些工作
<8-17,Sheldon>I think you're giving me these tasks

328
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,280
<8-17,Sheldon>因为你担心我要是做了有意义的工作
<8-17,Sheldon>because you're afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do,

329
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,610
<8-17,Sheldon>我就会超过你
<8-17,Sheldon>I'll show you up.

330
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,410
<8-18,Amy>真的吗  你就这么想的吗
<8-18,Amy>Really? Is that what you think?

331
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,950
<8-19,Sheldon>对  我就是这么想的
<8-19,Sheldon>Yes, that's what I think.

332
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,230
<8-19,Sheldon>而我这么超级聪明的人  这没准就是事实
<8-19,Sheldon>And I'm super smart, so it's probably true.

333
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,210
<8-20,Amy>我在神经生物学领域锻炼了12年
<8-20,Amy>Hey, I've been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years.

334
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,460
<8-20,Amy>而你只来了3小时
<8-20,Amy>You've been here for three hours,

335
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,550
<8-20,Amy>其中1小时还花在厕所里了
<8-20,Amy>and you've spent one of them in the bathroom.

336
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,160
<8-21,Sheldon>不好意思  我没上过这里的厕所
<8-21,Sheldon>I'm sorry! It takes me a while

337
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,560
<8-21,Sheldon>总得花点时间来熟悉熟悉
<8-21,Sheldon>to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.

338
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,600
<8-22,Amy>谢尔顿  我给你的都是最简单的工作
<8-22,Amy>Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do,

339
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,770
<8-22,Amy>你还一件都没有做对
<8-22,Amy>and you haven't done one of them right.

340
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,640
<8-23,Sheldon>也许是因为这些工作没有挑战
<8-23,Sheldon>Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged.

341
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,340
<8-23,Sheldon>就和爱因斯坦数学不及格一样
<8-23,Sheldon>It's the same reason Einstein failed math.

342
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,300
<8-24,Amy>也许数学对他来说泡泡[0]太多了
<8-24,Amy>Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.

343
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,550
<8-25,Sheldon>你觉得切割大脑需要技术含量吗
<8-25,Sheldon>You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain?

344
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,530
<8-25,Sheldon>这和在三明治店做的没什么两样
<8-25,Sheldon>They could do the same thing at any Quiznos.

345
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,220
<8-25,Sheldon>而且他们还会给我吐司面包呢
<8-25,Sheldon>And they'd offer to toast it for me, too.

346
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,140
<8-26,Amy>好吧  聪明鬼
<8-26,Amy>Okay, smart guy.

347
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,990
<8-26,Amy>我正要切除蓝斑核
<8-26,Amy>I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus,

348
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,130
<8-26,Amy>这是份超精细的工作
<8-26,Amy>which is incredibly delicate work.

349
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,020
<8-26,Amy>你来吧
<8-26,Amy>Have at it.

350
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,200
<8-27,Sheldon>好啊
<8-27,Sheldon>All right.

351
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,090
<8-27,Sheldon>我对这种灰白质可熟悉了
<8-27,Sheldon>I'm no stranger to a little gray matter.

352
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,340
<8-27,Sheldon>蓝斑核
<8-27,Sheldon>Locus coeruleus.

353
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,620
<8-27,Sheldon>蓝斑核
<8-27,Sheldon>Locus coeruleus.

354
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,020
<8-28,Amy>你猜得差不多了  这确实是脑子里面的
<8-28,Amy>You're getting warmer-- it is, indeed, in the brain.

356
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,120
<8-28,Amy>希望你的手有够稳
<8-28,Amy>Hope your hands are steady.

357
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,150
<8-28,Amy>这活儿细如发丝
<8-28,Amy>It's the width of a single hair.

358
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,470
<8-28,Amy>但这不过是普通的生物学
<8-28,Amy>But this is just biology,

359
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,540
<8-28,Amy>肯定难不倒向你这样的天才
<8-28,Amy>so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you.

360
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,270
<8-29,Sheldon>那是当然  你要知道在物理学领域
<8-29,Sheldon>It's not. I'll have you know, in the field of physics,

361
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,960
<8-29,Sheldon>我们研究的粒子小到
<8-29,Sheldon>we work with particles so small,

362
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,600
<8-29,Sheldon>可以嘲笑你们的蓝斑体型过胖
<8-29,Sheldon>they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus.

363
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,100
<8-29,Sheldon>就是说  你们家蓝斑闲坐家中
<8-29,Sheldon>I.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house,

364
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,160
<8-29,Sheldon>那家里简直水泄不通
<8-29,Sheldon>it sits around the house.

365
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,590
<8-30,Amy>紧张了吗  库珀博士
<8-30,Amy>Oh... are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?

366
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,870
<8-30,Amy>没有
<8-30,Amy>No.

367
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,510
<8-31,Sheldon>你所看到的
<8-31,Sheldon>What you see

368
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,930
<8-31,Sheldon>是我满怀信心的颤抖
<8-31,Sheldon>is a man trembling with confidence.

369
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,560
<8-31,Sheldon>蓝斑通常都会出这么多血吗
<8-31,Sheldon>Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?

370
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,380
<8-32,Amy>不  但你的手指会
<8-32,Amy>No. But your thumb does.

371
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,600
<8-33,Sheldon>天啊
<8-33,Sheldon>Oh, dear.

372
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,480
<8-34,Amy>哎哟  就你还想当生物学家呢
<8-34,Amy>Yeah, you're a biologist.

373
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,840
<9-1,Howard>你来这干嘛
<9-1,Howard>What are you doing here?

374
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,030
<9-2,Sheldon>我在度假
<9-2,Sheldon>I'm on vacation.

375
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,800
<9-2,Sheldon>按照社会惯例
<9-2,Sheldon>Social convention dictates

376
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,030
<9-2,Sheldon>我应该来当地酒吧放松一下
<9-2,Sheldon>that I let my hair down at a local watering hole.

377
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,820
<9-2,Sheldon>社会惯例就是个屁
<9-2,Sheldon>Social convention is stupid.

378
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,410
<9-3,Howard>你的手指怎么了
<9-3,Howard>What happened to your thumb?

379
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,950
<9-4,Sheldon>我有十个手指十个脚趾
<9-4,Sheldon>I have ten fingers and ten toes.

380
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,860
<9-4,Sheldon>要我每个指头的故事你都要听
<9-4,Sheldon>If I tell you a story about each one of them,

381
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,930
<9-4,Sheldon>那可得说上一整天  所以算了吧
<9-4,Sheldon>we'll be here all day-- let's just move on.

382
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,090
<9-5,Barman>要点什么
<9-5,Barman>What can I get you?

383
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,670
<9-6,Sheldon>既然我是在度假
<9-6,Sheldon>Ah, seeing as I'm on vacation,

384
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,100
<9-6,Sheldon>凤椰朗姆酒比较合适
<9-6,Sheldon>uh, Pina Colada seems appropriate.

385
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,100
<9-6,Sheldon>凤梨片椰奶和白色褐色朗姆酒
<9-6,Sheldon>调制成的加勒比海特色鸡尾酒

386
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,840
<9-6,Sheldon>多加凤梨片和鲜奶油
<9-6,Sheldon>Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream,

387
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,080
<9-6,Sheldon>再给双份樱桃和小伞
<9-6,Sheldon>extra cherries, extra umbrellas,

388
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,180
<9-6,Sheldon>还有  不要朗姆酒
<9-6,Sheldon>and, uh, hold the rum.

389
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,310
<9-6,Sheldon>记得别让我喝太多
<9-6,Sheldon>Don't let me have too many of those.

390
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,550
<9-7,Penny>您二位在这干嘛呀
<9-7,Penny>Hey, what are you guys doing here?

391
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,710
<9-8,Howard>我们都是大人  就该在吧台这喝酒
<9-8,Howard>We're grown men; we drink at bars.

392
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,050
<9-9,Penny>扯  胡扯
<9-9,Penny>No and no.

393
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,260
<9-9,Penny>你和伯纳黛特还好吧
<9-9,Penny>Everything okay with you and Bernadette?

394
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
<9-10,Howard>好啊  当然好
<9-10,Howard>Oh, yeah, sure.

395
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,930
<9-11,Penny>你和艾米呢  还好吗
<9-11,Penny>You and Amy? Good?

396
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,970
<9-12,Sheldon>好得不能再好了
<9-12,Sheldon>Oh, better than good.

397
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,900
<9-13,Penny>要知道  她们都会把生活中的每件事都发短信告诉我
<9-13,Penny>You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.

398
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,630
<9-14,Howard>我是不会签婚前协议的
<9-14,Howard>I'm not signing a prenup.

399
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,490
<9-15,Penny>好吧  霍华德·沃罗威茨  给我听着
<9-15,Penny>All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up.

400
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,680
<9-15,Penny>她给你什么你就签什么
<9-15,Penny>You sign anything she puts in front of you,

401
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,510
<9-15,Penny>因为你是世上最幸运的人
<9-15,Penny>because you are the luckiest man alive.

402
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,410
<9-15,Penny>要是失去了她
<9-15,Penny>If you let her go,

403
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,020
<9-15,Penny>你再也不可能找到像她这么好的
<9-15,Penny>there is no way you can find anyone else--

404
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,180
<9-15,Penny>我是代表全体女同胞说这话
<9-15,Penny>speaking on behalf of all women,

405
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,150
<9-15,Penny>你绝对不可能再找到  我们开会一致认同的
<9-15,Penny>it is not gonna happen; we had a meeting.

406
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,540
<9-15,Penny>还有你  一个成年人
<9-15,Penny>And you, a grown man

407
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,950
<9-15,Penny>-居然看到一点点血就晕倒  -拜托
<9-15,Penny>- fainting at the sight of a little blood. - Excuse me,

408
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,450
<9-16,Sheldon>这个伤口那是相当大
<9-16,Sheldon>this is a fairly substantial wound.

409
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,450
<9-16,Sheldon>你...
<9-16,Sheldon>You...

410
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,910
<10-1,Sheldon>艾米  艾米  艾米
<10-1,Sheldon>Amy? Amy? Amy?

411
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,580
<10-2,Amy>有何贵干
<10-2,Amy>What do you want?

412
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,840
<10-3,Sheldon>我希望能继续在你实验室里度假
<10-3,Sheldon>I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory.

413
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,560
<10-3,Sheldon>毕竟当初我预定了一整周
<10-3,Sheldon>After all, I did book the whole week.

414
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,360
<10-4,Amy>你真的以为就凭你昨天那样
<10-4,Amy>Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here

415
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,220
<10-4,Amy>还能轻易地回来这里吗
<10-4,Amy>after the way you behaved yesterday?

416
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,530
<10-5,Sheldon>昨天我那是身不由已
<10-5,Sheldon>I was not myself.

417
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,390
<10-5,Sheldon>因为手指失血过多
<10-5,Sheldon>I had lost a lot of thumb blood.

418
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,030
<10-6,Amy>这话可不算道歉
<10-6,Amy>That's not an apology.

419
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,030
<10-7,Sheldon>就你不觉得而已
<10-7,Sheldon>That is your opinion.

420
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,910
<10-8,Amy>我想听的是真正的道歉
<10-8,Amy>I want a real apology.

421
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,430
<10-9,Sheldon>-我很抱歉你没有能够...  -不对
<10-9,Sheldon>- I'm sorry that you weren't able to... - No.

422
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,000
<10-11,Sheldon>抱歉我的天赋...
<10-11,Sheldon>...that my genius...

423
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,370
<10-10,Amy>不对
<10-10,Amy>No.

424
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,930
<10-13,Sheldon>抱歉那肥皂太...
<10-13,Sheldon>...that the soap was...

425
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,380
<10-14,Amy>谢尔顿
<10-14,Amy>Sheldon.

426
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,110
<10-14,Amy>好吧
<10-14,Amy>Fine.

427
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,110
<10-15,Sheldon>对不起
<10-15,Sheldon>Sorry.

428
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,680
<10-16,Amy>我原谅你
<10-16,Amy>You're forgiven.

429
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,000
<10-16,Amy>你若真想留下来  就先去洗那些烧杯
<10-16,Amy>Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers.

430
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,870
<10-16,Amy>昨天就没洗干净
<10-16,Amy>They're still dirty from yesterday.

431
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,150
<10-17,Sheldon>明年度假我要去"未来世界"玩
<10-17,Sheldon>Next year I'm going to EPCOT.

433
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,090
<11-1,Bernadette>你在生我气吗
<11-1,Bernadette>Are you mad at me?

434
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,550
<11-2,Howard>不  我没有生你气
<11-2,Howard>No. I'm not mad at you.

435
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,130
<11-2,Howard>我只是...
<11-2,Howard>I just...

436
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,350
<11-2,Howard>希望你直接跟我说
<11-2,Howard>wish you would have come to me,

437
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,290
<11-2,Howard>而不是让我从某些书呆口中听到
<11-2,Howard>so I didn't have to hear it through the nerd-vine.

438
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,260
<11-3,Bernadette>那我们该怎么办
<11-3,Bernadette>So, what are we gonna do?

439
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,820
<11-4,Howard>你真的想让我签婚前协议吗
<11-4,Howard>You really want me to sign a prenup?

440
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,410
<11-4,Howard>我不知道
<11-4,Howard>I don't know.

441
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,870
<11-5,Bernadette>虽然我爸在这点态度上非常强硬
<11-5,Bernadette>My dad's pretty insistent on it, though.

442
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,110
<11-6,Howard>何不让我跟你爸谈谈  来个男人之间的对话
<11-6,Howard>Why don't I talk to your dad, man-to-man?

443
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,680
<11-7,Bernadette>真的吗  那太好了
<11-7,Bernadette>Really? Oh, that'd be so great!

444
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,450
<11-8,Howard>就这么说定了
<11-8,Howard>Done.

445
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,010
<11-9,Bernadette>我先警告你一些注意事项
<11-9,Bernadette>I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things.

446
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,450
<11-9,Bernadette>虽然我爸已经从警局退休了
<11-9,Bernadette>Even though he's retired from the police force,

447
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,890
<11-9,Bernadette>他还是配着枪
<11-9,Bernadette>he still carries his gun.

448
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,610
<11-9,Bernadette>但别担心  他不会开枪的
<11-9,Bernadette>But don't worry, he won't shoot it.

449
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,840
<11-9,Bernadette>更多是想彰显自己时髦
<11-9,Bernadette>It's more of a fashion statement.

450
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,500
<11-10,Howard>好的
<11-10,Howard>Okay.

451
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,760
<11-11,Bernadette>为安全起见  你跟他谈的时候
<11-11,Bernadette>And just to be safe, when you talk to him,

452
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,130
<11-11,Bernadette>千万别提起吉米·卡特  园艺师
<11-11,Bernadette>don't bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners,

454
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,110
<11-11,Bernadette>外国人  同性恋者  西恩·潘
<11-11,Bernadette>foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn,

455
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,540
<11-11,Bernadette>第二次梵蒂冈大公会议  枪支管理法  有机食品
<11-11,Bernadette>Vatican II, gun control, organic food,

456
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,690
<11-11,Bernadette>指定打击规则  资源回收  或你是犹太人的事实
<11-11,Bernadette>the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you're Jewish.

457
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,060
<11-12,Howard>明白  明白
<11-12,Howard>Got it, got it.

458
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,960
<11-12,Howard>把这单子电邮给我吧
<11-12,Howard>Will you e-mail me that list?

459
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,460
<11-13,Bernadette>所以要当心的是
<11-13,Bernadette>So the thing to watch for,

460
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,720
<11-13,Bernadette>若他冲你吼  那就没事
<11-13,Bernadette>if he's shouting at you, you're okay,

461
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
<11-13,Bernadette>但若他开始变得沉默
<11-13,Bernadette>but if he starts to get real quiet,

462
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,730
<11-13,Bernadette>千万别跟他目光接触  有多快就跑多块
<11-13,Bernadette>leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact.

463
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,190
<11-13,Bernadette>切勿跑直线  要之字形逃命
<11-13,Bernadette>Not in a straight line-- throw some zigs and zigs in there.

464
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,510
<11-14,Howard>反正这事也不是迫在眉睫
<11-14,Howard>You know, this isn't that pressing.

465
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,770
<11-14,Howard>不如等五月份我再找他谈吧
<11-14,Howard>Why don't I talk to him about it in May.

466
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,960
<11-15,Bernadette>五月你就上国际空间站了
<11-15,Bernadette>In May you're gonna be on the International Space Station.

467
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,760
<11-16,Howard>空间站也有电话的嘛
<11-16,Howard>They got a phone.
