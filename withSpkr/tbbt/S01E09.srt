28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,490
<1-13,Sheldon>发送了一个命令把音响关小的
<1-13,Sheldon>Around the world via the internet.

<2-4,Raj>I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised,

72

<2-7,Sheldon>在一封信旁边自动生成一只垃圾桶
<2-7,Sheldon>Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,180
<2-7,Sheldon>是有可能出现的事情

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,050
<2-8,Leonard>是实验物理研究院寄来的
<2-8,Leonard>It's from the institute for experimental physics.

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,950
<2-8,Leonard>他们希望我们能在
<2-8,Leonard>They want us to present our paper

84
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,690
<2-9,Sheldon>我知道  我扔之前看过
<2-9,Sheldon>I know, I read it before I threw it out.

85
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,450
<2-10,Leonard>容许我把问题阐述地更清楚些
<2-10,Leonard>Okay, if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,150
<2-10,Leonard>你为什么要扔了它呢
<2-10,Leonard>Why did you throw it out?

87
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,650
<2-11,Sheldon>因为我没兴趣站在万豪国际酒店的
<2-11,Sheldon>Because I have no interest in standing in the rose room

90
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,870
<2-11,Sheldon>他们不会意识到
<2-11,Sheldon>Who wouldn't recognize true genius

91
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,710
<2-11,Sheldon>在他们面前做演讲的人是真正的天才
<2-11,Sheldon>If it was standing in front of them giving a speech.

92
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,380
<2-11,Sheldon>因为如果我在那  我会这么认为的
<2-11,Sheldon>Which, if I were there, it would be.

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,700
<2-12,Howard>我不知道  谢尔顿

<2-14,Howard>别提那些庆功会?  你个白痴
<2-14,Howard>Forget the parties? what a nerd.

98
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,850
<2-15,Leonard>还有什么别的荣誉我不知道的吗
<2-15,Leonard>Are there any other honors I've gotten that I don't know about?

99
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,290
<2-15,Leonard>UPS有没有快递过
<2-15,Leonard>Did ups drop off a nobel prize

100
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,950
<2-15,Leonard>给我的诺贝尔奖?
<2-15,Leonard>With my name on it?

101
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,590
<2-16,Sheldon>里奥纳德  你千万别误会
<2-16,Sheldon>Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way,

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,120
<2-16,Sheldon>不过你得诺贝尔奖的那天
<2-16,Sheldon>But the day you win a nobel prize

103
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,050
<2-16,Sheldon>就是我开始研究
<2-16,Sheldon>Is the day I begin my research

104
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,430
<2-16,Sheldon>阿拉伯飞毯上那些穗状雄花图案的风阻系数的那天
<2-16,Sheldon>On the drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
<2-17,Raj>刚才那些侮辱中
<2-17,Raj>Ooh, the only thing missing

106
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,240
<2-17,Raj>唯一没有提到的就是"你妈妈"
<2-17,Raj>From that insult was "your mama."

107
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,610
<2-18,Howard>我补充一个
<2-18,Howard>I got one.

108
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,220
<2-18,Howard>里奥纳德  你妈妈的研究方法问题实在太多...
<2-18,Howard>Hey, leonard, your mama's research methodology is so flawed...

109
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,460
<2-19,Leonard>闭嘴  霍华德
<2-19,Leonard>Shut up, howard.

110
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,020
<2-19,Leonard>谢尔顿  我们得去参加这个
<2-19,Leonard>Sheldon, we have to do this.

111
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,320
<2-19,Leonard>不  我们不
<2-19,Leonard>No, we don't.

112
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,620
<2-20,Sheldon>我们得吸取营养  排除毒素
<2-20,Sheldon>We have to take in nourishment, expel waste,

113
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,090
<2-20,Sheldon>并且吸入足够的氧气来维持我们细胞鲜活
<2-20,Sheldon>And inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying.

114
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,250
<2-20,Sheldon>其它任何事都不是必须的
<2-20,Sheldon>Everything else is optional.

115
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,890
<2-21,Leonard>好  那我这么说吧  我要去参加
<2-21,Leonard>Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.

116
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,850
<2-22,Sheldon>你不能  我是第一作者
<2-22,Sheldon>You can't. I'm the lead author.

117
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,290
<2-23,Leonard>别逗了  之所以你是第一作者
<2-23,Leonard>Come on, the only reason you're the lead author

118
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,020
<2-23,Leonard>是因为这是按名字字母排序的
<2-23,Leonard>Is because we went alphabetically.

119
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,820
<2-24,Sheldon>是我让你这么认为的
<2-24,Sheldon>I let you think we went alphabetically

120
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,220
<2-24,Sheldon>好让你不用面对这一耻辱性的事实
<2-24,Sheldon>To spare you the humiliation

121
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,790
<2-24,Sheldon>那就是这篇论文是我想出来的
<2-24,Sheldon>Of dealing with the fact that it was my idea.

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,550
<2-24,Sheldon>不是我有意要说得那么直白
<2-24,Sheldon>Not to put too fine a point on it,

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,450
<2-24,Sheldon>但事实是  我在可怜你
<2-24,Sheldon>But I was throwing you a bone.

124
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,420
<2-24,Sheldon>不用谢
<2-24,Sheldon>You're welcome.

125
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,750
<2-25,Leonard>慢着  这个假说的实验证明是我设计的
<2-25,Leonard>Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.

126
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,730
<2-26,Sheldon>它根本就不用证明
<2-26,Sheldon>It doesn't need proving.

127
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,820
<2-27,Leonard>这么说  整个学术界就会那么
<2-27,Leonard>So the entire scientific community

128
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,250
<2-27,Leonard>不加任何质疑地相信你的话?
<2-27,Leonard>Is just supposed to take your word?

129
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,150
<2-28,Sheldon>不是会  是他们应该那样
<2-28,Sheldon>They're not supposed to, but they should.

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,020
<2-29,Leonard>算了  我不管你说什么
<2-29,Leonard>All right, I don't care what you say,

131
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,220
<2-29,Leonard>我要去参加会议并展示我们的成果
<2-29,Leonard>I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.

132
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,030
<2-30,Sheldon>我不允许
<2-30,Sheldon>And I forbid it.

133
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,680
<2-31,Leonard>你不允许?
<2-31,Leonard>You forbid it?

134
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,350
<2-32,Sheldon>如果我没有因为我们的成果而得到好评  那没人可以
<2-32,Sheldon>If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is.

135
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,090
<2-33,Leonard>-这么说你承认这是我们俩的成果?  -没有
<2-33,Leonard>So you admit that it's our work? no.

136
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,190
<2-34,Sheldon>再说一遍  我是在可怜你
<2-34,Sheldon>Once again, I'm throwing you a bone.

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,860
<2-34,Sheldon>并且再说一遍  不用谢
<2-34,Sheldon>And once again you are welcome.

138
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,500
<2-36,Howard>不  他不会吧(模仿里奥纳德)
<2-36,Howard>Oh, no, he didn't

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,290
<3-1,Penny>你和谢尔顿现在怎样了
<3-1,Penny>So, how's it going with sheldon?

140
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,250
<3-1,Penny>你们还是谁也不理谁吗
<3-1,Penny>Are you guys still not talking to each other?

141
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,020
<3-2,Leonard>他不但还是不跟我说话
<3-2,Leonard>Not only is he still not talking to me,

142
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,220
<3-2,Leonard>还会这么瞪着你  并做这么个动作
<3-2,Leonard>But there's this thing he does where he stares at you

143
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,300
<3-2,Leonard>试图把你的脑子弄爆
<3-2,Leonard>And tries to get your brain to explode.

144
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,060
<3-2,Leonard>就像那种经典的高科技电影里的扫描器
<3-2,Leonard>You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie scanners.

145
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,470
<3-2,Leonard>这样...
<3-2,Leonard>Like... bzzz...

146
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,350
<3-2,Leonard>不说了
<3-2,Leonard>Never mind.

147
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,110
<3-4,Leonard>这件怎么样?
<3-4,Leonard>How about this one?

148
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,090
<3-2,Leonard>可以告诉别人说  我是物理学家  但我也是个有趣的人
<3-2,Leonard>It says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy.

149
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,700
<3-3,Penny>我不知道现在还有做灯芯绒外套
<3-3,Penny>Wow, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits.

150
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,320
<3-4,Leonard>是不做了  所以我才一直留着它
<3-4,Leonard>They don't.That's why I saved this one.

151
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,380
<3-5,Penny>好吧  让我再看看
<3-5,Penny>Okay, well, let's just see

152
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,270
<3-5,Penny>你还有什么别的
<3-5,Penny>What else you have.

153
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,320
<3-5,Penny>拿着这个...
<3-5,Penny>Okay, here, take this...

154
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,390
<3-5,Penny>和这个  这个  还有这些...
<3-5,Penny>And this, and this, and these...

155
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,220
<3-6,Leonard>所有这些你都要让我试穿?
<3-6,Leonard>Is this all stuff you want me to try on?

156
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,230
<3-7,Penny>不  这些是我想让你扔了的
<3-7,Penny>No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

157
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,540
<3-9,Penny>说真的  甚至不要把它们捐作慈善
<3-9,Penny>Oh. seriously, don't even give them to charity.

158
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,640
<3-9,Penny>你这不是在帮助任何人
<3-9,Penny>You won't be helping anyone.

159
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,700
<3-9,Penny>这是什么?
<3-9,Penny>What's this?

160
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,500
<3-10,Leonard>这是坎多(对抗魔人的守卫国度)的瓶中城
<3-10,Leonard>That's the bottle city of kandor.

161
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,620
<3-12,Leonard>知道吗  坎多曾经是
<3-12,Leonard>You see, kandor was the capital city

162
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,920
<3-12,Leonard>克里顿星球(还是星球大战)的首都
<3-12,Leonard>Of the planet krypton.

163
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,390
<3-12,Leonard>它被天才在克里顿爆炸前缩小了
<3-12,Leonard>It was miniaturized by brainiac before krypton exploded,

164
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,760
<3-12,Leonard>然后被超人拯救了
<3-12,Leonard>And then rescued by superman.

165
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,250
<3-13,Penny>不错
<3-13,Penny>Oh. nice.

166
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,720
<3-14,Leonard>还是女孩子不看这些的时候比较好
<3-14,Leonard>It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.

167
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,080
<3-15,Penny>你穿上这个试试
<3-15,Penny>Here, why don't you put these on

168
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,710
<3-15,Penny>我再看看有没有合适的T恤和运动外衣
<3-15,Penny>While I find a shirt and a sport coat that match.

169
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,880
<3-16,Leonard>好  我马上回来
<3-16,Leonard>Great, I'll be right back.

170
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,990
<3-17,Penny>你去哪里?  就这样换了
<3-17,Penny>Where are you going? just put 'em on.

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,250
<3-18,Leonard>在这?
<3-18,Leonard>Here?

172
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,590
<3-19,Penny>你还害羞啊?
<3-19,Penny>Oh, are you shy?

173
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,790
<3-20,Leonard>没  我没害羞
<3-20,Leonard>No, I'm not shy.

174
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,050
<3-21,Penny>别担心  我不会看的
<3-21,Penny>Don't worry. I won't look.

175
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,050
<3-22,Leonard>我知道你不会看  你为什么要看
<3-22,Leonard>I know you won't look. why would you look?

176
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,490
<3-22,Leonard>这也没什么好看的...倒也不是...
<3-22,Leonard>There's nothing to see... well, not nothing...

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,290
<3-23,Penny>亲爱的  把裤子穿上
<3-23,Penny>Sweetie, put the pants on.

178
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,960
<3-24,Leonard>穿了穿了
<3-24,Leonard>Putting 'em on.

179
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,320
<3-25,Penny>你跟谢尔顿在演讲这件事情上
<3-25,Penny>So, you know, isn't there maybe some way

180
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,750
<3-25,Penny>就没有互相妥协的余地吗
<3-25,Penny>You and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing?

181
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,040
<3-25,Penny>不  没有
<3-25,Penny>No, no.

182
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,720
<3-26,Leonard>科学家从不妥协
<3-26,Leonard>Scientists do not compromise.

183
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,650
<3-26,Leonard>我们的大脑被锻炼成就是把事实结合起来
<3-26,Leonard>Our minds are trained to synthesize facts

184
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,320
<3-26,Leonard>然后得出无可辩驳的结论
<3-26,Leonard>And come to inarguable conclusions.

185
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,230
<3-26,Leonard>更不用说  谢尔顿还是个怪胎
<3-26,Leonard>Not to mention, sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

186
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,720
<3-27,Penny>这是什么?
<3-27,Penny>What is this?

187
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,730
<3-28,Leonard>小心
<3-28,Leonard>Oh, careful.

188
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,350
<3-28,Leonard>那个是原版
<3-28,Leonard>That's my original series

189
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,130
<3-28,Leonard>太空堡垒卡拉狄加的飞行服
<3-28,Leonard>Battlestar galactica flight suit.

190
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,020
<3-29,Penny>万圣节的时候你怎么没穿这个?
<3-29,Penny>Oh, why didn't you wear it on halloween?

191
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,630
<3-30,Leonard>因为那不是制服  是件飞行服
<3-30,Leonard>Because it's not a costume. it's a flight suit.

192
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,200
<3-31,Penny>好的  我继续找
<3-31,Penny>Okay, all right, moving on.

193
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,550
<3-31,Penny>羊毛针织花衬衫
<3-31,Penny>Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.

194
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,130
<3-32,Leonard>它正好配我那件灯芯绒外套
<3-32,Leonard>Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

195
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,490
<3-33,Penny>如果你是说他们得呆在一个地方  那我同意
<3-33,Penny>If you mean they should end up in the same place, then I agree.

196
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,730
<3-33,Penny>这是你唯一的领带吗
<3-33,Penny>Is this your only tie?

197
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,320
<3-34,Leonard>理论上  是的
<3-34,Leonard>Technically, yes.

198
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,420
<3-34,Leonard>但如果你仔细看
<3-34,Leonard>But if you'll notice...

199
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,330
<3-34,Leonard>会发现这是两面的
<3-34,Leonard>It's reversible.

200
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,850
<3-34,Leonard>所以可以当两条用
<3-34,Leonard>So it works as two.

201
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,690
<3-35,Penny>亲爱的  我觉得它连一条都不算
<3-35,Penny>Oh sweetie, I don't even think it works as one.

202
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,420
<3-35,Penny>这就是你所有的衣服吗
<3-35,Penny>Is this all your clothes?

203
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,890
<3-36,Leonard>对  从我八年级到现在所有的
<3-36,Leonard>Yup. everything since the eighth grade.

204
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,190
<3-37,Penny>八...八年级?
<3-37,Penny>The... the eighth grade?

205
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,530
<3-38,Leonard>我从那时起就不再长了
<3-38,Leonard>My last growth spurt.

206
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,920
<3-39,Penny>那好  我想我们还是回到这套灯芯绒外套吧
<3-39,Penny>Okay, well, I guess we're back to the corduroy suit.

207
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,630
<3-40,Leonard>好的
<3-40,Leonard>Great. yep.

208
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,620
<3-41,Penny>我说了不行  扔一边去
<3-41,Penny>I said no. put it down.

209
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,860
<4-1,Penny>好啊  谢尔顿
<4-1,Penny>Hey, sheldon.

210
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,590
<4-2,Sheldon (unlocking his mailbox)>你好  潘妮
<4-2,Sheldon (unlocking his mailbox)>Hello, penny.

211
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,930
<4-3,Penny>有什么好东西吗
<4-3,Penny>Get anything good?

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,230
<4-4,Sheldon>最近一季度的应用粒子物理学报
<4-4,Sheldon>Just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly.

213
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,260
<4-5,Penny>真奇怪  怎么你的来了我的却没到
<4-5,Penny>Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't.

214
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,430
<4-5,Penny>我开玩笑呢
<4-5,Penny>It was a joke.

215
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,380
<4-5,Penny>给女服务生点小费
<4-5,Penny>Yep, tip your waitresses.

216
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,400
<4-5,Penny>我这一周都在
<4-5,Penny>I'm here all week.

217
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,920
<4-6,Sheldon>潘妮  为了避免你感觉更加尴尬
<4-6,Sheldon>Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness,

218
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,990
<4-6,Sheldon>如果我们两个安安静静地走上楼
<4-6,Sheldon>Know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,800
<4-6,Sheldon>我完全没有意见
<4-6,Sheldon>Climbing the stairs in silence.

220
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,020
<4-7,Penny>是的  我也是
<4-7,Penny>Oh, yeah, okay, me, too.

221
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,920
<4-7,Penny>嘴巴拉上  闭紧
<4-7,Penny>Zip it, lock it.

222
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,800
<4-7,Penny>放在兜里
<4-7,Penny>Put it in your pocket.

223
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,720
<4-7,Penny>你和里奥纳德
<4-7,Penny>So, you and leonard.

224
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,400
<4-8,Sheldon>天呐
<4-8,Sheldon>Oh, dear god.

225
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,840
<4-9,Penny>有点小误会  是吧
<4-9,Penny>A little misunderstanding, huh?

226
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,530
<4-10,Sheldon>有点小误...?
<4-10,Sheldon>A little misundersta...?

227
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,500
<4-10,Sheldon>伽利略和教皇之间是有点小误会
<4-10,Sheldon>Galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding.

228
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,420
<4-11,Penny>不管怎样  我今天早上跟里奥纳德聊天
<4-11,Penny>Anyway, I was talking to leonard this morning,

229
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,130
<4-11,Penny>我认为他对于这事感到很难过
<4-11,Penny>And I think he feels really bad about it.

230
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,520
<4-13,Penny>你是什么感受
<4-13,Penny>Well, how do you feel?

231
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,480
<4-14,Sheldon>你没理解你这个问题
<4-14,Sheldon>I don't understand the question.

232
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,720
<4-15,Penny>不  我是问和最好的朋友发生争执
<4-15,Penny>No, I'm just asking if it's difficult

233
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,950
<4-15,Penny>是不是感觉很难受
<4-15,Penny>To be fighting with your best friend.

234
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,950
<4-16,Sheldon>我还没那么想过
<4-16,Sheldon>Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.

235
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,150
<4-16,Sheldon>我在想我是否正在经受
<4-16,Sheldon>I wonder if I've been experiencing

236
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,850
<4-16,Sheldon>由于无意识感情上混乱
<4-16,Sheldon>Physiological manifestations

237
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,300
<4-16,Sheldon>而导致的一些生理表现
<4-16,Sheldon>of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.

238
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,100
<4-17,Penny>等等  什么?
<4-17,Penny>Wait. what?

239
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,440
<4-18,Sheldon>我今天早上拉不出屎
<4-18,Sheldon>I couldn't poop this morning.

240
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,350
<4-19,Penny>跟他说说话吧
<4-19,Penny>Just talk to him.

241
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,780
<4-19,Penny>我想你们一定能把问题解决的
<4-19,Penny>I'm sure you guys can work this out.

242
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,660
<4-20,Sheldon>这肯定比我的计划更好
<4-20,Sheldon>It's certainly preferable to my plan.

243
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,920
<4-21,Penny>你什么计划?
<4-21,Penny>Which was?

244
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,390
<4-22,Sheldon>用强力泻药
<4-22,Sheldon>A powerful laxative.

245
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,710
<4-23,Penny>好吧  你真的应该跟他好好谈谈
<4-23,Penny>Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him.

246
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,290
<4-23,Penny>我知道里奥纳德把你当朋友的
<4-23,Penny>Look, I know leonard values you as a friend,

247
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,390
<4-23,Penny>他亲口告诉我  如果没有你那些小点子
<4-23,Penny>And he told me himself that without your little idea,

248
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,990
<4-23,Penny>他就不可能
<4-23,Penny>There's no way he could have

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,960
<4-23,Penny>完成这整个实验
<4-23,Penny>Come up with this whole experiment thing.

250
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,260
<4-24,Sheldon>不好意思  "小点子"?
<4-24,Sheldon>Excuse me. "little idea"?

251
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,020
<4-25,Penny>我是说  他试着跟我解释过
<4-25,Penny>Yeah, I mean, he tried to explain it to me.

252
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,050
<4-25,Penny>我没有弄得很明白...
<4-25,Penny>I didn't really understand it...

253
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,090
<4-26,Sheldon>你当然没明白
<4-26,Sheldon>Of course, you didn't.

254
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,220
<4-26,Sheldon>他说"小点子"?
<4-26,Sheldon>He said, "little idea"?

255
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,800
<4-27,Penny>不  他不是那么说的
<4-27,Penny>Well, no, not in... not in those words.

256
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,490
<4-28,Sheldon>那是怎么说的  确切点
<4-28,Sheldon>In what words then, exactly?

257
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,150
<4-29,Penny>天  确切的词是...
<4-29,Penny>Um, you know, gee, the exact words...

258
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,720
<4-29,Penny>他主要的意思是说...
<4-29,Penny>It's more the spirit in which...

259
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,650
<4-30,Sheldon>他说什么?
<4-30,Sheldon>What did he say?

260
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,500
<4-31,Penny>你只是碰运气预感到的
<4-31,Penny>You had a lucky hunch.

261
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,250
<4-32,Leonard (coming out of apartment)>谢尔顿  我刚才一直在想
<4-32,Leonard (coming out of apartment)>Hey, sheldon, I've been thinking.

262
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,290
<4-32,Leonard (coming out of apartment)>我们一直争执这个问题还不如...
<4-32,Leonard (coming out of apartment)>Instead of arguing about this...

263
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,080
<4-33,Sheldon>不要再跟我说话
<4-33,Sheldon>Don't you ever speak to me again.

264
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,530
<4-33,Sheldon>什...?
<4-33,Sheldon>Wha...?

265
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,990
<4-35,Penny>他...
<4-35,Penny>He...

266
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,450
<5-1,Leonard>我去参加会议了
<5-1,Leonard>Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

267
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,940
<5-2,Sheldon>祝你演讲我那"幸运的预感"愉快
<5-2,Sheldon>Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch."

268
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,570
<5-3,Leonard>谢尔顿  我不是那个意思
<5-3,Leonard>Shel, I didn't mean it like that.

269
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,390
<5-4,Sheldon>那你为什么要那么说
<5-4,Sheldon>Then why did you say it?

270
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,530
<5-5,Leonard>我不知道  我不是...
<5-5,Leonard>I don't know. I wasn't...

271
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,000
<5-6,Sheldon>你是想取悦潘妮?
<5-6,Sheldon>Were you trying to impress penny?

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,950
<5-7,Leonard>不  不  完全不是  有那么一点
<5-7,Leonard>No, no, not at all. a little bit.

273
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,590
<5-8,Sheldon>那么做有效果吗
<5-8,Sheldon>How'd that work out for you?

274
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,020
<5-9,Penny (entering)>里奥纳德  准备走了吗
<5-9,Penny (entering)>Leonard, ready to go?

275
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,920
<5-10,Sheldon>力比多(弗洛伊德理论)  1-0
<5-10,Sheldon>libido 1.0.

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,530
<5-11,Leonard>好  我再问你一次
<5-11,Leonard>Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

277
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,620
<5-11,Leonard>这个成果是咱们一起完成的
<5-11,Leonard>We did the work together.

278
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,050
<5-11,Leonard>就让咱们一起去做演讲
<5-11,Leonard>Let's present the paper together.

279
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,790
<5-12,Sheldon>我也跟你说最后一遍
<5-12,Sheldon>And I'm telling you for the last time

280
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,730
<5-12,Sheldon>你这是在拉皮条  这是没有尊严的  咬我吧
<5-12,Sheldon>It's pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.

281
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,990
<5-13,Leonard>我们走吧
<5-13,Leonard>Let's go.

282
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,250
<5-14,Penny>再见  谢尔顿
<5-14,Penny>Bye, sheldon.

283
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,890
<5-14,Penny>再见  潘妮
<5-14,Penny>Good-bye, penny.

284
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,160
<5-15,Sheldon>就在未来的某一天...
<5-15,Sheldon>One of these days...

285
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,700
<6-1,Penny>还不错
<6-1,Penny>There you go.

286
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,350
<6-2,Leonard>你说的没错  这面果然更好看
<6-2,Leonard>You're right. this side does look better.

287
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,990
<6-3,Penny>不  不  我没说"更好看"
<6-3,Penny>No, no, I didn't say "better."

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,620
<6-3,Penny>我只是说"褪色少一些"
<6-3,Penny>I said "less stained."

289
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,150
<6-4,Howard>我刚观察了下  里面大约
<6-4,Howard>i just checked the house. there's probably

290
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,370
<6-4,Howard>有20-25个人
<6-4,Howard>20-25 people in there.

291
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,390
<6-5,Leonard>开玩笑吧?
<6-5,Leonard>You're kidding?

292
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,190
<6-6,Penny>-一共就这些?  -就这些?
<6-6,Penny>Is that all? "all"?

293
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,590
<6-7,Leonard>对高能物理学领域来说  25人已称得上伍德斯托克(摇滚音乐节)了
<6-7,Leonard>In particle physics, 25 is woodstock.

294
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,820
<6-8,Penny>这样啊  那不错
<6-8,Penny>Oh, well, then good.

295
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,970
<6-9,Leonard>我没想到会有这么多人  我有点紧张
<6-9,Leonard>I wasn't expecting such a crowd. I'm a little nervous.

296
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,490
<6-10,Howard>没事  讲个笑话做开场白就不紧张了
<6-10,Howard>It's okay. just open with a joke. you'll be fine.

297
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,050
<6-10,Howard>笑话  好的
<6-10,Howard>Uh, joke. okay,

298
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,920
<6-10,Howard>这个怎么样?
<6-10,Howard>How about this?

299
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,520
<6-11,Leonard>有个农民
<6-11,Leonard>Um, okay, uh, there's this farmer,

300
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,020
<6-11,Leonard>他养了一些鸡
<6-11,Leonard>And he has these chickens,

301
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,490
<6-11,Leonard>但是它们不下蛋  所以他去找物理学家求救
<6-11,Leonard>But they won't lay any eggs, so he calls a physicist to help.

302
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,650
<6-11,Leonard>这个物理学家便做了些计算
<6-11,Leonard>The physicist then does some calculations,

303
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,090
<6-11,Leonard>然后说"我有个办法
<6-11,Leonard>And he says, "i have a solution,

304
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,860
<6-11,Leonard>不过只适用于真空环境下的球形鸡(加拿大科学家凯伊的方法)"
<6-11,Leonard>But it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum."

305
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,660
<3-16,Leonard>好笑吧?
<3-16,Leonard>Right?

306
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,750
<6-12,Penny>抱歉  我...我以前听过
<6-12,Penny>Oh, sorry, I just... I've heard it before.

307
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,790
<6-13,Howard>-我们进去吧  -好的
<6-13,Howard>Let's roll. okay.

308
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,790
<6-13,Howard>西服不错
<6-13,Howard>Hey, nice suit.

309
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,920
<6-14,Leonard>一流的  是吧?
<6-14,Leonard>It's a classic, right?

310
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,270
<6-15,Penny>我真应该把我的车开来
<6-15,Penny>I really should have brought my own car.

311
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,600
<7-1,Leonard>因此我们总结如下  数据表明
<7-1,Leonard>So, in conclusion, the data show

312
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,750
<7-1,Leonard>当温度接近绝对零度时
<7-1,Leonard>That at temperatures approaching absolute zero,

313
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,520
<7-1,Leonard>转动惯量就会发生改变
<7-1,Leonard>The moment of inertia changes,

314
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,890
<7-1,Leonard>而固体就会变成一种超固体
<7-1,Leonard>And the solid becomes a supersolid which clearly appears

315
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,430
<7-1,Leonard>成为一种之前未知的物质
<7-1,Leonard>To be a previously unknown state of matter.

316
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,030
<7-1,Leonard>谢谢
<7-1,Leonard>Thank you.

317
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,030
<7-3,Leonard>请问有任何问题吗
<7-3,Leonard>Were there any questions?

318
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,620
<7-2,Voice>有  那到底是什么玩意?
<7-2,Voice>Yeah, what the hell was that?

319
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,630
<7-3,Leonard>还有其他问题吗
<7-3,Leonard>Any other questions?

320
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,750
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>Dr. sheldon cooper here.

321
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,700
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>是这篇论文的第一作者
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>I am the lead author of this particular paper.

322
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,230
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>谢谢
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>Thank you.

323
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,350
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>而你  这位先生  完全跳过了一个重要部分
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part

324
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,150
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>当时我是在公园里散步
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>Where I was walking through the park,

325
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,220
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>看见小孩们在玩旋转木马
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>And I saw these children on a merry-go-round,

326
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,720
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>正是这才让我想起转动惯性
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>Which started me thinking about the moment of inertia

327
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,250
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>当温度接近绝对零度
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>In gases like helium

328
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,320
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>在气体里  比如氦气里的表现
<7-4,Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)>At temperatures approaching absolute zero.

329
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,990
<7-5,Leonard>我没有跳过  这只是个小插曲
<7-5,Leonard>I didn't skip it. it's just an anecdote.

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,990
<7-5,Leonard>不是科学
<7-5,Leonard>It's not science.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,190
<7-6,Sheldon>原来是这样
<7-6,Sheldon>Oh, I see.

332
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,290
<7-6,Sheldon>那么苹果落在牛顿的头上
<7-6,Sheldon>Was the apple falling on newton's head,

333
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,590
<7-6,Sheldon>也仅仅是个小插曲?
<7-6,Sheldon>Was that just an anecdote?

334
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,840
<7-7,Leonard>你不是艾萨克·牛顿
<7-7,Leonard>You are not isaac newton.

335
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,970
<7-8,Sheldon>是  是  这倒是不错
<7-8,Sheldon>No, no, that's true.

336
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,090
<7-8,Sheldon>对我来说  不用那苹果我也会知道是地球引力
<7-8,Sheldon>Gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.

337
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,850
<7-9,Leonard>你能不能不那么自大
<7-9,Leonard>You could not possibly be that arrogant.

338
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,620
<7-10,Sheldon>你仍旧低估了我  我的伙计
<7-10,Sheldon>You continue to underestimate me, my good man.

339
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,550
<7-11,Leonard>听着  如果你因为我的演讲而不高兴
<7-11,Leonard>Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation,

340
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,650
<7-11,Leonard>那你应该跟我一起来讲的
<7-11,Leonard>Then maybe you should have given it with me.

341
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,680
<7-12,Sheldon>就像我反复解释的  我不像你
<7-12,Sheldon>As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,

342
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,150
<7-12,Sheldon>我不需要比我笨的人来认可我
<7-12,Sheldon>I don't need validation from lesser minds.

343
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,590
<7-12,Sheldon>没有别的意思
<7-12,Sheldon>No offense.

344
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,090
<7-13,Leonard>那你还为什么来?
<7-13,Leonard>So why did you come?

345
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,520
<7-14,Sheldon>因为我知道你会把它糟蹋了的
<7-14,Sheldon>Because I knew you'd screw this up.

346
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,520
<7-15,Leonard>我才没有糟蹋
<7-15,Leonard>I didn't screw it up

347
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,460
<7-16,Sheldon>开玩笑
<7-16,Sheldon>Oh, please,

348
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,040
<7-16,Sheldon>-我承认那个球形鸡的笑话...是挺好笑  -谢谢
<7-16,Sheldon>I admit that spherical chicken joke-- that was hilarious. Thanks.

349
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,400
<7-16,Sheldon>不过从那里开始就急转直下了
<7-16,Sheldon>But it was straight downhill from there.

350
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,390
<7-17,Leonard>我受够了你这种高傲的态度
<7-17,Leonard>I've had enough of your condescension.

351
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,270
<7-17,Leonard>也许我没有像你一样11岁就考上大学
<7-17,Leonard>Maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you.

352
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,770
<7-17,Leonard>也许我是24岁才拿到博士  而不像你是16岁
<7-17,Leonard>Maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16,

353
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,030
<7-17,Leonard>但你不是这个屋子里
<7-17,Leonard>But you are not the only person

354
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,950
<7-17,Leonard>唯一一个比他们都聪明的人
<7-17,Leonard>Who is smarter than everyone else in this room

355
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,760
<7-17,Leonard>没别的意思
<7-17,Leonard>No offense.

356
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,820
<7-17,Leonard>我显然并不是这里唯一一个
<7-17,Leonard>And I am clearly not the only person

357
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,090
<7-17,Leonard>怀着不安全感  渴望得到
<7-17,Leonard>Who is tormented by insecurity

358
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,050
<7-17,Leonard>不断的肯定  并为之饱受苦恼的人
<7-17,Leonard>And has an ego in need of constant validation.

359
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,590
<7-18,Sheldon>那你承认你是个自大狂了?
<7-18,Sheldon>So you admit that you're an egotist?

360
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
<7-18,Sheldon>对
<7-18,Sheldon>Yes

361
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,220
<7-19,Leonard>我是里奥纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
<7-19,Leonard>My name is dr. leonard hofstadter

362
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,750
<7-19,Leonard>我从不讨我父母喜欢
<7-19,Leonard>And I could never please my parents,

363
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,490
<7-19,Leonard>所以我需要从你们这些陌生人这里
<7-19,Leonard>So I need to get all my self-esteem

364
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,490
<7-19,Leonard>把自尊心都找回来
<7-19,Leonard>From strangers like you.

365
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,800
<7-19,Leonard>但他更差劲
<7-19,Leonard>But he's worse

366
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,550
<7-20,Sheldon>-好的  够了  -别闹了
<7-20,Sheldon>Okay, that is it stop it

367
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,850
<7-21,Leonard>你不可能用意念爆了我的头
<7-21,Leonard>You cannot blow up my head with your mind

368
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,950
<7-22,Sheldon>那给你弄个动脉瘤也成
<7-22,Sheldon>Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.

369
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,020
<7-23,Leonard (knocking his hands down)>别弄了
<7-23,Leonard (knocking his hands down)>Stop it

370
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,920
<7-24,Sheldon>你打我

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,230
<7-24,Sheldon>你们都看到了  他打我
<7-24,Sheldon>You saw that. he hit me.

372
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,570
<7-25,Leonard>是你想爆了我的头
<7-25,Leonard>You were trying to blow up my head.

373
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,630
<7-26,Sheldon>所以还是起作用了
<7-26,Sheldon>So it was working.

374
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,800
<7-27,Leonard>才不是呢  你简直是个疯子
<7-27,Leonard>It was not you are a nut case

378
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,450
<7-28,Sheldon>别闹了
<7-28,Sheldon>Stop it

379
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,040
<7-29,Leonard>停下来
<7-29,Leonard>Quit it

380
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,750
<7-30,Penny>你们搞物理的经常这样?
<7-30,Penny>Is this usually how these physics things go?

381
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,080
<7-31,Howard>比你想的要频繁
<7-31,Howard>More often than you think.

382
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,700
<7-32,Leonard (getting Sheldon on floor)>停下  我要发功把你弄爆
<7-32,Leonard (getting Sheldon on floor)>Stop it nerve pinch

384
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,320
<8-2,Leonard>我没开车把你碾过去你已经很幸运了
<8-2,Leonard>You're lucky I didn't run you over.

385
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,650
<8-3,Sheldon>我真不知道你在不开心些什么
<8-3,Sheldon>I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about.

386
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,040
<8-3,Sheldon>你求我去  我去了
<8-3,Sheldon>You begged me to come. I came.

387
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,420
<8-3,Sheldon>结果你还是不高兴
<8-3,Sheldon>There's just no pleasing you.

388
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,650
<8-4,Leonard>没错  问题都在我这
<8-4,Leonard>You're right. I'm the problem.

<8-4,Leonard>我是那个需要帮助的人
<8-4,Leonard>I'm the one that needs help.

390
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,850
<8-5,Sheldon>这不是很像道歉
<8-5,Sheldon>Well, that's not much of an apology,

391
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,320
<8-5,Sheldon>但我接受了
<8-5,Sheldon>But I'll take it.
