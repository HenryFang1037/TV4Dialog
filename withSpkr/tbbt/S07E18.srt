<1-2,Raj>他人在德州  不可能会知道
<1-2,Raj>He's Texas, he'll never know.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,250
<1-3,Penny>我觉得话别说太早
<1-3,Penny>I wouldn't be so sure about that.

<1-7,Penny>谢尔顿没在台下找茬吗
<1-7,Penny>Sheldon didn't heckle him?

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,030
<1-8,Bernadette>没有  而且他超级乖
<1-8,Bernadette>No, in fact, he was so well-behaved,

<1-14,Raj>We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn't like.

00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,850

<2-2,Raj>"Lame characters with silly ac..."

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,260
<2-5,Penny>别这样嘛  各位
<2-5,Penny>Come on, guys.

62
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,700
<2-6,Leonard>拉杰为这游戏废了不少心思呢
<2-6,Leonard>Raj put a lot of effort into this.

63
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,700
<2-6,Leonard>这很棒啊
<2-6,Leonard>And that's great.

64
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,140
<2-6,Leonard>完全不悲催  很棒
<2-6,Leonard>It's not sad, it's great.

65
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,740
<2-7,Amy>今晚扮演一下其他人应该会挺好玩的
<2-7,Amy>I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.

66
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,340
<2-8,Raj>其实今晚大家都是演自己
<2-8,Raj>Actually, you're all just gonna be yourselves.

67
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,900
<2-10,Bernadette>好吧  如果要玩
<2-10,Bernadette>All right, if I'm doing this,

68
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,940
<2-10,Bernadette>姐就要赢  所以先说清楚
<2-10,Bernadette>I'm playing to win, so just to be clear:

69
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,250
<2-10,Bernadette>这游戏是指我们其中一人杀死斯图尔特吗
<2-10,Bernadette>If we're ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?

70
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,540
<2-11,Raj>非常好  伯纳黛特
<2-11,Raj>Very good, Bernadette.

71
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,780
<2-11,Raj>你就是个波克西·巴克锡
<2-11,Raj>You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.

72
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,150
<2-12,Bernadette>那是啥  印度版夏洛克·福尔摩斯吗
<2-12,Bernadette>What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?

73
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,650
<2-13,Raj>也可能夏洛克是英国版的波克西·巴克锡
<2-13,Raj>Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?

74
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,510
<2-14,Amy>根据维基百科  是先有夏洛克
<2-14,Amy>According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.

75
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,410
<2-14,Amy>很好  大家都是波克西·巴克锡
<2-14,Amy>Great, everyone's a Byomkesh Bakshi.

76
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,300
<2-15,Raj>现在发给各位
<2-15,Raj>Now... here are some

77
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,090
<2-15,Raj>关于你们自己的秘密资料
<2-15,Raj>secret facts about each of you,

78
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,070
<2-15,Raj>包含你们自己是不是凶手
<2-15,Raj>including whether you are the murderer.

79
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,620
<2-15,Raj>游戏过程中  随时都可以问对方
<2-15,Raj>Throughout the game, feel free to ask

80
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,770
<2-15,Raj>各种问题来得到线索
<2-15,Raj>each other questions to uncover clues.

81
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,300
<2-16,Penny>懂了
<2-16,Penny>Got it. Hey...

82
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,320
<2-16,Penny>谁是凶手啊
<2-16,Penny>who's the murderer?

83
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,240
<2-17,Raj>像这种问题不能问
<2-17,Raj>Any question but that.

84
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,760
<2-18,Penny>抱歉
<2-18,Penny>Sorry. Hey...

85
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,570
<2-18,Penny>谁不是凶手啊
<2-18,Penny>who's not the murderer?

86
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,100
<2-19,Stuart>伯纳黛特  能别站得离我这么近吗
<2-19,Stuart>Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?

87
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,620
<2-20,Bernadette>有什么关系  你都死了
<2-20,Bernadette>What do you care? You're dead.

88
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,510
<2-21,Stuart>随你高兴
<2-21,Stuart>Suit yourself.

89
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,750
<2-21,Stuart>但我貌似能看见你裙里风光
<2-21,Stuart>But I can kind of... see up your skirt.

90
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,080
<3-1,Sheldon>谢谢你送我摇头公仔
<3-1,Sheldon>Thank you for my bobble head.

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,850
<3-2,Howard>也谢谢你没在我演讲时找我茬
<3-2,Howard>Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.

92
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,720
<3-3,Sheldon>忍住不找茬很不容易吧  巴兹
<3-3,Sheldon>It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz?

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,520
<3-4,Howard>我们不能两手空空的去你妈妈家吧
<3-4,Howard>We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed.

94
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,190
<3-4,Howard>应该带点礼物
<3-4,Howard>We should bring something.

95
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,250
<3-5,Sheldon>我已经带了
<3-5,Sheldon>I already am.

96
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,470
<3-5,Sheldon>我带了知识的馈赠
<3-5,Sheldon>I'm bringing the gift of knowledge.

97
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,820
<3-6,Howard>天啊
<3-6,Howard>Oh, boy.

98
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,470
<3-7,Sheldon>无论她的圣经写过啥
<3-7,Sheldon>Despite what her Bible says,

99
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,550
<3-7,Sheldon>最新的考古研究显示
<3-7,Sheldon>recent archeological studies indicate that

100
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,280
<3-7,Sheldon>虽然旧约圣经中曾提到过骆驼
<3-7,Sheldon>although camels are referenced in the Old Testament,

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,940
<3-7,Sheldon>但骆驼实际出现在中东的时间
<3-7,Sheldon>they didn't exist in the Middle East

102
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,250
<3-7,Sheldon>比圣经里晚了几百年
<3-7,Sheldon>until hundreds of years later.

103
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,380
<3-8,Howard>我本来是要说带个蛋糕或者派去
<3-8,Howard>I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie.

104
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,000
<3-8,Howard>但羞辱她的信仰也很有心意
<3-8,Howard>But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.

105
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,390
<4-1,Bernadette>接下来呢
<4-1,Bernadette>So, what happens next?

106
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,560
<4-2,Raj>我不能直接说出来
<4-2,Raj>I can't tell you that.

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,770
<4-2,Raj>但凶手很可能
<4-2,Raj>But perhaps the killer dropped

108
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,600
<4-2,Raj>在公寓里留下了一道
<4-2,Raj>a fun and imaginative clue

109
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,110
<4-2,Raj>有趣又创意十足的线索哦
<4-2,Raj>somewhere in the apartment.

110
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,380
<4-3,Penny>我要去检查一下冰箱
<4-3,Penny>Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge,

111
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,130
<4-3,Penny>看看啤酒里有没有藏什么线索
<4-3,Penny>and see if there are any clues inside a beer.

112
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,310
<4-4,Amy>我找到了个东西
<4-4,Amy>Hey, I-I found something.

113
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,870
<4-4,Amy>看起来像一个拿着行李箱的小人偶
<4-4,Amy>It looks like a little man with a briefcase.

114
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,020
<4-5,Leonard>他是克莱伦斯·戴罗
<4-5,Leonard>Oh, no, no. That's Clarence Darrow.

115
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,540
<4-5,Leonard>是谢尔顿发明的律师版蛇棋中的角色
<4-5,Leonard>It's from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers.

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,310
<4-5,Leonard>滑道让你倒退  前进则是
<4-5,Leonard>You slide down a chute and then work your way back up

117
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,190
<4-5,Leonard>靠上诉系统慢慢爬
<4-5,Leonard>through the appellate system.

118
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,250
<4-6,Raj>跟那不同的是  我的游戏好玩多了
<4-6,Raj>Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.

119
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,310
<4-7,Penny>我能问你个问题吗
<4-7,Penny>Okay, can I ask you something?

120
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,250
<4-7,Penny>你为什么总喜欢找我们玩这些游戏
<4-7,Penny>Why do you like making us do this stuff?

121
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,250
<4-8,Raj>可能跟我小时后在印度时是个胖子有关
<4-8,Raj>Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India,

122
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,540
<4-8,Raj>那时候我都没有朋友
<4-8,Raj>and didn't have any friends.

123
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,880
<4-9,Bernadette>我不知道你以前是个胖子
<4-9,Bernadette>I didn't know you were fat.

124
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,320
<4-9,Bernadette>是啊  我...
<4-9,Bernadette>Yeah, I was...

125
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,060
<4-10,Raj>我念中学的时候体重有90公斤呢
<4-10,Raj>I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school.

126
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,710
<4-10,Raj>老被别的孩子欺负
<4-10,Raj>Kids were mean.

127
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,000
<4-10,Raj>虽然在印度牛是神圣的动物
<4-10,Raj>Cows may be sacred there,

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,610
<4-10,Raj>可是你身形像牛却一点都不好
<4-10,Raj>but it doesn't help if you look like one.

129
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,860
<4-10,Raj>总之那时的我很孤独
<4-10,Raj>Anyway, I was pretty lonely,

130
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,130
<4-10,Raj>只好自己编故事和游戏娱乐自己
<4-10,Raj>so I had to make up my own stories and games,

131
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,200
<4-10,Raj>我暗自发誓
<4-10,Raj>and I promised myself

132
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,150
<4-10,Raj>如果我有了朋友
<4-10,Raj>if I ever made any friends that...

133
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,730
<4-10,Raj>我一定会跟他们一起玩这些游戏
<4-10,Raj>that I would play those games with them.

134
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,710
<4-11,Amy>真是让人又怜又爱
<4-11,Amy>That is so sweet.

135
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,900
<4-12,Leonard>我见过你以前的照片
<4-12,Leonard>I've seen old pictures of you.

136
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,290
<4-12,Leonard>你一点都不胖啊
<4-12,Leonard>You were never a fat kid.

137
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,120
<4-13,Raj>是的  我跟羚羊一样苗条
<4-13,Raj>No, I was svelte as a gazelle.

138
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,460
<4-13,Raj>我是一只拥有讲故事天赋的羚羊
<4-13,Raj>A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.

139
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,350
<4-14,Bernadette>这个呢  这貌似是一张收据
<4-14,Bernadette>Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.

140
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,340
<4-15,Amy>什么收据
<4-15,Amy>What's it for?

141
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,200
<4-16,Bernadette>买咖啡的
<4-16,Bernadette>For a cup of coffee.

142
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,190
<4-16,Bernadette>但上面的日期是20年后
<4-16,Bernadette>But it's dated 20 years from now.

143
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,650
<4-17,Raj>来自未来的收据
<4-17,Raj>From the future?!

144
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,550
<4-17,Raj>真是有趣又创意十足
<4-17,Raj>How fun and imaginative.

145
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,920
<4-18,Leonard>所以我们中有一个人从未来回来
<4-18,Leonard>So one of us came back from the future

146
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,620
<4-18,Leonard>-杀死了斯图尔特  -没错
<4-18,Leonard>- to murder Stuart? - Correct.

147
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,020
<4-20,Leonard>那只拥有讲故事天赋的羚羊
<4-20,Leonard>Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling

148
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,950
<4-20,Leonard>知道他的故事是在抄袭《终结者》吗
<4-20,Leonard>know he's just ripping off Terminator?

149
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,990
<4-21,Raj>那个自以为是的家伙知道《终结者》
<4-21,Raj>Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually

150
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,750
<4-21,Raj>卡梅隆后来承认《终结者》是受到60年代电视科幻剧《外星界限》
<4-21,Raj>里面的两集故事《士兵》和《玻璃手的魔鬼》的启发而创作

151
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,630
<4-21,Raj>其实是抄袭哈兰·埃里森为《外星界限》
<4-21,Raj>ripped off from an Outer Limits script called

152
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,750
<4-21,Raj>编写的一集名为"玻璃手的魔鬼"的剧本吗
<4-21,Raj>Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?

153
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,800
<4-22,Leonard>那只羚羊知道哈兰·埃里森后来又说
<4-22,Leonard>Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison,

154
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,330
<4-22,Leonard>《终结者》不是抄袭《玻璃手的魔鬼》
<4-22,Leonard>it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand,

155
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,130
<4-22,Leonard>而是抄袭他为《外星界限》编写的另外一个剧本
<4-22,Leonard>but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote

156
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,560
<4-22,Leonard>名为《士兵》吗
<4-22,Leonard>called The Soldier?

157
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,920
<4-23,Penny>我要再来一瓶"线索"
<4-23,Penny>I'm gonna need another clue.

158
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,770
<4-23,Penny>好
<4-23,Penny>Okay...

159
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,860
<5-1,Howard>把花和派给我
<5-1,Howard>give me the flowers and pie.

160
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,880
<5-2,Sheldon>但如果我们敲门  礼物在你手里
<5-2,Sheldon>But if we show up and you're holding them,

161
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,660
<5-2,Sheldon>她会认为这些都是你买的
<5-2,Sheldon>she'll think they're only from you.

162
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,110
<5-3,Howard>本来就是我买的
<5-3,Howard>They are only from me.

163
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,050
<5-3,Howard>你说自己就是最好的礼物
<5-3,Howard>You said the gift of you was enough.

164
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,090
<5-4,Sheldon>话是这么说  但现在我手里拿着花和派
<5-4,Sheldon>Yes... but now that I've seen what the gift of me

165
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,570
<5-4,Sheldon>显得我这份礼更大了
<5-4,Sheldon>with flowers and pie looks like,

166
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,640
<5-4,Sheldon>所以你休想拿回去了
<5-4,Sheldon>there's no going back.

167
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,020
<5-4,Sheldon>我已经等不及想看她一脸惊喜的样子
<5-4,Sheldon>Boy, I can't wait to see the look on her face...

168
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,650
<5-5,Howard>我们现在就走
<5-5,Howard>We're leaving right now.

169
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,820
<5-6,Sheldon>-怎么了  -没事
<5-6,Sheldon>- What's wrong? - Nothing.

170
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,220
<5-7,Howard>谢尔顿  告诉我发生什么事了
<5-7,Howard>What? Sheldon, tell me what's going on!

171
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,620
<5-8,Sheldon>我看见我妈跟一个裸男纠缠在一起
<5-8,Sheldon>I saw my mommy with a naked man

172
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,610
<5-8,Sheldon>她想再次"当妈妈"
<5-8,Sheldon>and she was trying to be a mommy again.

173
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,440
<6-1,Howard>你想谈一谈吗
<6-1,Howard>You ready to talk about it?

174
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,000
<6-2,Sheldon>我还不够醉呢
<6-2,Sheldon>I'm not nearly drunk enough.

175
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,370
<6-2,Sheldon>够醉了
<6-2,Sheldon>Okay.

176
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,880
<6-2,Sheldon>你知道看见自己妈妈在蹂躏别人
<6-2,Sheldon>Do you have any idea what it's like to see

177
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,330
<6-2,Sheldon>是什么感觉吗
<6-2,Sheldon>your mother ravaging someone?

178
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,960
<6-3,Howard>蹂躏鸡胸肉算吗
<6-3,Howard>Does a brisket count?

179
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,700
<6-3,Howard>抱歉  兄弟  的确难以忍受
<6-3,Howard>I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough.

180
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,330
<6-3,Howard>她不是知道我们会来吗
<6-3,Howard>But didn't she know we were coming?

181
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:31,920
<6-6,Sheldon>不知道
<6-6,Sheldon>No.

182
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,100
<6-4,Sheldon>我想给她一个惊喜
<6-4,Sheldon>I wanted to surprise her.

183
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,250
<6-4,Sheldon>经历这种事之后  我该跟她说什么呀
<6-4,Sheldon>What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?

184
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,660
<6-5,Howard>-她有从窗户看见你吗  -没有
<6-5,Howard>- Well, did she see you in the window? - No.

185
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,260
<6-7,Howard>那就什么都别说
<6-7,Howard>Then don't say anything.

186
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,720
<6-8,Sheldon>我一定要说
<6-8,Sheldon>I have to.

187
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,290
<6-8,Sheldon>如果我们想拥有一段健康的母子关系
<6-8,Sheldon>How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship

188
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,090
<6-8,Sheldon>我就得告诉她我对她有多失望
<6-8,Sheldon>if I don't tell her how disappointed I am,

189
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,160
<6-8,Sheldon>而且我这辈子都不会原谅她
<6-8,Sheldon>and that I'll never forgive her?

190
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,600
<6-9,Howard>那也别用手机说啊
<6-9,Howard>Well, don't do it on the phone.

191
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,130
<6-10,Sheldon>不是啦  我只是告诉她我要去找她
<6-10,Sheldon>No, I'm just going to tell her I'm coming

192
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,550
<6-10,Sheldon>这样她才赶紧会把那个爽歪歪的人打发走
<6-10,Sheldon>so she can give that Good Time Charlie the heave-ho.

193
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,460
<6-11,Howard>这是一场艰难的对话
<6-11,Howard>That's some tough talk.

194
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,450
<6-11,Howard>我就不跟你过去了
<6-11,Howard>I may need to cut you off.

195
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,940
<6-12,Sheldon>你最好跟我过去
<6-12,Sheldon>Yeah, maybe you better.

196
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,920
<6-12,Sheldon>我可是喝了一大口酒
<6-12,Sheldon>I took a pretty big sip.

197
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,780
<6-13,Howard>你妈是个成年人了
<6-13,Howard>Look, she's a grown woman.

198
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,890
<6-13,Howard>你爸又不在这么久了
<6-13,Howard>And-and your dad's been gone a long time.

199
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,860
<6-13,Howard>或许你真不应该多管闲事
<6-13,Howard>Maybe this is none of your business.

200
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,030
<6-14,Sheldon>恕难同意
<6-14,Sheldon>I beg to differ.

201
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,440
<6-14,Sheldon>我曾经住在那个生殖器里
<6-14,Sheldon>I used to live in those genitals.

202
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,920
<6-14,Sheldon>如果有人想搬进我的"旧房间"
<6-14,Sheldon>And if someone wants to move into my old room,

203
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,130
<6-14,Sheldon>那我至少有投票的权利吧
<6-14,Sheldon>I should at least get a vote.

204
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,790
<7-1,Raj>各位嫌疑犯
<7-1,Raj>Okay, murder suspects,

205
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,630
<7-1,Raj>莱纳德发现了凶手使用过的时光机
<7-1,Raj>Leonard has found the time machine the killer must've used.

206
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,090
<7-1,Raj>大家都坐进去
<7-1,Raj>You're all inside it,

207
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,060
<7-1,Raj>现在我们要穿越时空啦
<7-1,Raj>and we hurtle through the very fabric of time.

208
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,870
<7-1,Raj>欢迎来到20年后的未来
<7-1,Raj>And welcome to 20 years in the future.

209
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,450
<7-1,Raj>喂  你们刚刚穿越时空
<7-1,Raj>Hey, you guys just time-traveled.

210
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,560
<7-1,Raj>别看起来这么没劲好吗
<7-1,Raj>Stop looking so bored.

211
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,550
<7-2,Penny>我的啤酒还有气泡  我的奶子没有下垂
<7-2,Penny>Well, my beer isn't flat and my rack's not saggy.

212
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,880
<7-2,Penny>所以目前为止  未来还不错
<7-2,Penny>So far, the future's great.

213
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,750
<7-3,Stuart>我可以去厕所吗
<7-3,Stuart>Hey, can I go to the bathroom?

214
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,970
<7-4,Raj>去吧  别看起来太生气勃勃
<7-4,Raj>Fine, just try not to look too alive.

215
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,840
<7-5,Stuart>这我可是专家
<7-5,Stuart>That's my jam.

216
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,390
<7-6,Bernadette>我们其中一人回到过去杀死斯图尔特
<7-6,Bernadette>So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?

217
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,360
<7-7,Amy>为什么
<7-7,Amy>But why?

218
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,300
<7-8,Raj>或许这个能回答你们的疑问
<7-8,Raj>Perhaps this will help.

219
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,490
<7-8,Raj>这是关于未来的
<7-8,Raj>Here are some facts

220
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,160
<7-8,Raj>你们的一些事情
<7-8,Raj>about yourselves in the future

221
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,650
<7-8,Raj>里面可能包含线索哦
<7-8,Raj>that might contain a clue.

222
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,730
<7-9,Amy>我获得了诺贝尔生理学奖
<7-9,Amy>Hey, I-I won the Nobel Prize in physiology.

223
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,520
<7-9,Amy>然后我用奖金把斯图尔特的漫画店买下来
<7-9,Amy>Then I used the money to buy Stuart's comic book store,

224
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,930
<7-9,Amy>关了那店  好让谢尔顿多放注意力在我身上
<7-9,Amy>and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me.

225
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,960
<7-9,Amy>这主意还不赖
<7-9,Amy>Not the worst idea.

226
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,220
<7-10,Penny>我是一名住在伦敦的著名演员
<7-10,Penny>Hey, I'm a famous actress living in London.

227
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,710
<7-11,Leonard>我是斯坦福大学的教授
<7-11,Leonard>I'm a professor at Stanford.

228
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,240
<7-13,Bernadette>看来你们就算远距离也能很相爱
<7-13,Bernadette>So I guess you two are making it work long distance.

229
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,910
<7-13,Bernadette>错
<7-13,Bernadette>Oh, no.

230
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,200
<7-14,Raj>在这次游戏中  因为你们各自职业的有了起色
<7-14,Raj>In this game, as your careers both took off,

231
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,170
<7-14,Raj>所以分道扬镳了
<7-14,Raj>you drifted apart.

232
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,940
<7-14,Raj>有点像未来的我
<7-14,Raj>Kind of like how future me

233
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,810
<7-14,Raj>在成为年老色衰却柔软依旧的麦当娜的
<7-14,Raj>lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy

234
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,070
<7-14,Raj>小男宠后就跟你们断了联系了
<7-14,Raj>for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.

235
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,360
<7-15,Amy>你的卡上说什么  伯纳黛特
<7-15,Amy>What does your card say, Bernadette?

236
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,550
<7-16,Leonard>等一下
<7-16,Leonard>Eh, eh, eh, hang on.

237
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,460
<7-16,Leonard>你觉得如果我俩都事业有成的话
<7-16,Leonard>Do-do you think we'd really drift apart

238
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,100
<7-16,Leonard>就真的会分手吗
<7-16,Leonard>if we both became successful?

239
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,450
<7-17,Penny>当然不会
<7-17,Penny>Of course not.

240
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,170
<7-17,Penny>如果我成了大明星  要搬去别的地方
<7-17,Penny>If I became a famous actress and had to move,

241
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,770
<7-17,Penny>你当然跟着我走啦
<7-17,Penny>you would just come with me.

242
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,330
<7-18,Leonard>但如果我有机会成为终身教授
<7-18,Leonard>But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor,

243
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,820
<7-18,Leonard>我就没法随便决定去留了
<7-18,Leonard>I might not have that much choice in where I end up.

244

<8-18,Mrs Cooper>你不能这样对你妈妈说话
<8-18,Mrs Cooper>That is no way to speak to your mother.

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,920
<8-19,Sheldon>对妈妈或许不能

<9-2,Leonard>我不懂为什么你演艺事业的成功
<9-2,Leonard>I-I-I don't understand why any success you have in acting

315
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,990
<9-2,Leonard>要比我在科学领域的成就重要得多

<9-3,Penny>我才不会告诉你当电影明星爽在哪里呢
<9-3,Penny>I'm not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best.

320
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,080
<9-3,Penny>反正爽就对了
<9-3,Penny>They just are.

321
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,160
<9-4,Amy>真奇怪  你们竟然没讨论过这种事
<9-4,Amy>I'm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.

322
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,230
<9-5,Leonard>难道你和谢尔顿把话都说清楚了吗
<9-5,Leonard>Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?

323
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,970
<9-6,Amy>事实上  我们的恋爱协议里
<9-6,Amy>Actually, our relationship agreement

324
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,890
<9-6,Amy>囊括了各种情况

00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,640
<9-7,Penny>谁能猜到二十年后我们会变成什么样呢
<9-7,Penny>In 20 years, who knows what'll happen with any of us?

329
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,190
<9-8,Stuart>我觉得你和莱纳德会终成眷属
<9-8,Stuart>I think you and Leonard will be together.

330
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,900
<9-9,Penny>-真的吗  -真的

<9-15,Penny>Ah-da-da-da-da!

335
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,310
<9-15,Penny>让这位"死者"先说完
<9-15,Penny>Let the dead man talk.

336
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,250
<9-15,Penny>你为什么这么想呢
<9-15,Penny>So, why do you think that?

337
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,090
<9-16,Stuart>我觉得你俩提升了彼此的境界
<9-16,Stuart>Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better.

338
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,290
<9-16,Stuart>佩妮让莱纳德走出了宅男世界
<9-16,Stuart>Penny brought Leonard out of his shell.

339
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,640
<9-16,Stuart>而莱纳德又让
<9-16,Stuart>And it seems like Leonard makes Penny

340
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,280
<9-16,Stuart>佩妮对世界有了更深层的认识
<9-16,Stuart>think more deeply about the world.

341
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,110
<9-16,Stuart>我也说不清
<9-16,Stuart>I don't know.

342
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,990
<9-16,Stuart>你们在一起  互补成为了一个非常棒的人
<9-16,Stuart>Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.

343
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,280
<9-17,Penny>斯图尔特
<9-17,Penny>Aw, Stuart.

344
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,380
<9-17,Penny>现在我真为杀了你感到内疚
<9-17,Penny>Now I feel bad for murdering you.

<10-1,Howard>我可以进来吗
<10-1,Howard>Hey, can I come in?

349
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,930
<10-2,Sheldon>显然任何男人都可以乱入这个家
<10-2,Sheldon>Apparently any man is welcome in this house.

350
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,670
<10-2,Sheldon>你为何不行
<10-2,Sheldon>Why not you?

351
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,540
<10-2,Sheldon>你不是在车上等着吗
<10-2,Sheldon>I thought you were waiting in the car.

352
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,120
<10-3,Howard>那是一个小时前了  谢尔顿
<10-3,Howard>That was an hour ago, Sheldon.

<10-3,Howard>"For Sale" signs start to go up.

355
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,680
<10-3,Howard>看来你和你妈妈谈得不顺利
<10-3,Howard>I take it things didn't go smoothly with your mom.

356
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,270
<10-3,Howard>不
<10-3,Howard>No.

357
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,410
<10-4,Sheldon>我不知道我们该如何度过这个难关
<10-4,Sheldon>I'm not sure how we're going to get past this.

358
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,080
<10-5,Howard>其实  我...
<10-5,Howard>You know, I...

359
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,840
<10-5,Howard>我自己也曾经经历过

<10-6,Sheldon>Howard, we've all seen your mother naked.

362
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,930
<10-6,Sheldon>那个女人需要学会系紧睡袍
<10-6,Sheldon>That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.

363
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,290
<10-7,Howard>我说的是  我爸离开几年后
<10-7,Howard>I'm talking about when my mom started seeing someone

364
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,240
<10-7,Howard>我妈开始约会
<10-7,Howard>a couple years after my dad left.

365
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,120
<10-8,Sheldon>我不知道她曾经约会过
<10-8,Sheldon>I didn't know she did.

366
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,800
<10-9,Howard>她和一个男的约会
<10-9,Howard>Yeah, she was dating this guy,

367
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,120
<10-9,Howard>我对她的态度挺混蛋的
<10-9,Howard>and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.

368
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,460
<10-10,Sheldon>你做了什么
<10-10,Sheldon>What did you do?

369
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,550
<10-11,Howard>这样说吧  那是圣殿寺历史上
<10-11,Howard>Well, let's just say it was the most vicious

370
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,530
<10-11,Howard>最恶毒的成人礼演讲
<10-11,Howard>bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El.

371
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,700
<10-11,Howard>总之  她和他分手了
<10-11,Howard>Anyway, she broke up with him.

372
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,470
<10-11,Howard>自那以后  她基本上就一直孤身一人
<10-11,Howard>And she's basically been alone ever since.

373
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,770
<10-11,Howard>她从未说过  但我一直觉得
<10-11,Howard>She never said it, but I always felt

374
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,040
<10-12,Sheldon>我是让她孤单的原因
<10-12,Sheldon>I was the reason why.

375
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,020
<10-12,Sheldon>真遗憾
<10-12,Sheldon>I'm sorry.

376
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,810
<10-12,Sheldon>不过  基于你的故事
<10-12,Sheldon>Although, based on your story,

377
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,000
<10-12,Sheldon>你绝对是让她孤单的原因
<10-12,Sheldon>you absolutely were the reason why.

378
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,240
<10-13,Howard>我想说的是  你还是不要
<10-13,Howard>All I'm saying is you might not want

379
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,860
<10-13,Howard>阻碍你母亲的幸福比较好
<10-13,Howard>to get in the way of your mom's happiness.

380
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,000
<10-14,Sheldon>你说的有道理
<10-14,Sheldon>You may have a point.

381
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,240
<10-14,Sheldon>我爱我母亲
<10-14,Sheldon>I love my mother.

382
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,140
<10-14,Sheldon>哪怕她像个恶魔黄鼠狼般疯狂交配
<10-14,Sheldon>Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.

383
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,150
<10-15,Howard>伤痛已经开始治愈了
<10-15,Howard>And the healing begins.

384
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,420
<11-1,Sheldon>-你好  -你好
<11-1,Sheldon>- Hello. - Hello.

385
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,970
<11-2,Mrs Cooper>你能像成年人一样冷静地讨论这件事了吗
<11-2,Mrs Cooper>Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?

386
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,110
<11-3,Sheldon>能
<11-3,Sheldon>I am.

387
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,960
<11-4,Mrs Cooper>谢利  很抱歉让你看到那一幕
<11-4,Mrs Cooper>Shelly, I'm sorry that you saw what you saw.

388
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,590
<11-4,Mrs Cooper>我知道这让你难以接受
<11-4,Mrs Cooper>I know that this is hard for you.

389
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,750
<11-5,Sheldon>母亲  我想最让我生气的
<11-5,Sheldon>I think what most upsets me about it, Mother,

390
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,740
<11-5,Sheldon>是你的虚伪
<11-5,Sheldon>is the hypocrisy.

391
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,960
<11-5,Sheldon>这与你毕生信奉的
<11-5,Sheldon>Doesn't this contradict

392
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,020
<11-5,Sheldon>所有宗教教条  不是相抵触的吗
<11-5,Sheldon>all the religious rules you've been espousing your whole life?

393
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,750
<11-6,Mrs Cooper>你说得对  的确抵触  关于这点
<11-6,Mrs Cooper>You're right, it does, and it's something

394
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,260
<11-6,Mrs Cooper>我已经挣扎了一段时间
<11-6,Mrs Cooper>that I'm struggling with these days.

395
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,720
<11-7,Sheldon>那你为什么还要这样做
<11-7,Sheldon>Then why are you doing it?

396
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,790
<11-8,Mrs Cooper>因为我并不完美  谢利
<11-8,Mrs Cooper>Because I'm not perfect, Shelly.

397
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,620
<11-8,Mrs Cooper>但那个男人的屁屁很完美
<11-8,Mrs Cooper>And that man's booty is.

398
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
<11-9,Sheldon>这是对我来说很困惑
<11-9,Sheldon>Well, this is confusing for me.

399
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,500
<11-9,Sheldon>但我不想阻碍你幸福
<11-9,Sheldon>But I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness.

400
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,410
<11-9,Sheldon>所以
<11-9,Sheldon>So...

401
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,970
<11-9,Sheldon>我会在内心谴责你
<11-9,Sheldon>I'll condemn you internally

402
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,070
<11-9,Sheldon>但外表保持接受的态度
<11-9,Sheldon>while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.

403
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,330
<11-10,Mrs Cooper>多谢你基督徒般的宽容
<11-10,Mrs Cooper>That is very Christian of you.

404
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,520
<11-11,Sheldon>母亲  如果你准备照这样生活下去
<11-11,Sheldon>Mother, if you're going to conduct your life in this fashion,

405
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,590
<11-11,Sheldon>我应该让你知道  世界已经不是
<11-11,Sheldon>then I should let you know that the world has changed

406
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,380
<11-11,Sheldon>你年轻时那个样子了
<11-11,Sheldon>since you were a young woman.

<11-11,Sheldon>冷饮销售员[40年代流行]和种族隔离了
<11-11,Sheldon>soda jerks and segregation anymore.

409
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,890
<11-12,Mrs Cooper>你觉得我到底多大年纪了
<11-12,Mrs Cooper>How old do you think I am?

410
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,810
<11-13,Sheldon>我要说的是  你得小心
<11-13,Sheldon>My point is that you're going to need to be careful.

<11-14,Mrs Cooper>你是在对我进行家长性爱教育吗
<11-14,Mrs Cooper>Are you having the sex talk with me?

416
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,930
<11-15,Sheldon>一定得有人说啊
