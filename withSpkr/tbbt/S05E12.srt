3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,990
<1-2,Leonard>好啊
<1-2,Leonard>Mm-hmm. Yep.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,240
<1-2,Leonard>盒子里除了空虚的童年时光  空无一物
<1-2,Leonard>I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,260
<1-3,Howard>吐槽过分了吧  学大提琴的
<1-3,Howard>Little snarky there, cello Lessons.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,890
<1-3,Howard>这里还有一个十分普通的圆筒
<1-3,Howard>And we have this completely ordinary cylinder.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,350
<1-3,Howard>你们也可以检查一下
<1-3,Howard>If you'd like to examine it...

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,520
<1-4,Raj>看似普通  不过我感觉到它
<1-4,Raj>Ordinary, yet I sense it is

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,670
<1-4,Raj>隐隐散发的魔力了
<1-4,Raj>dripping with magical potential.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,040
<1-5,Sheldon>哦  真要命
<1-5,Sheldon>Oh, dear Lord.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,850
<1-5,Sheldon>人家只是走开了一下  清了清肠子
<1-5,Sheldon>A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,410
<1-5,Sheldon>顺便追一下斗篷战士[蝙蝠侠别称]的冒险之旅
<1-5,Sheldon>and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader,

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,370
<1-5,Sheldon>再出来就发现家里
<1-5,Sheldon>only to emerge and discover his apartment

15
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,240
<1-5,Sheldon>赫然变成卡巴莱酒馆了
<1-5,Sheldon>has been transformed into a cabaret.

<1-7,Howard>正如我所说
<1-7,Howard>As I was saying...

19
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,990
<1-7,Howard>空盒子  空圆筒

<1-8,Raj>车厢中  肯定有你的一席之地
<1-8,Raj>the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.

24
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,080
<1-9,Sheldon>你就准备用这种方式
<1-9,Sheldon>This is how you're going to entertain

00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,600
<1-9,Sheldon>娱乐你的小表弟和他朋友吗
<1-9,Sheldon>your little cousin and his friends?

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,950
<1-9,Sheldon>靠蒙骗他们
<1-9,Sheldon>By lying to them?

27
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,750
<1-10,Howard>这怎么能是骗呢
<1-10,Howard>How is this lying?

28
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,570
<1-11,Sheldon>魔术表演本来就是充满了坑蒙拐骗
<1-11,Sheldon>A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition.

29
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,850
<1-11,Sheldon>"这是一顶普通的礼帽哦"
<1-11,Sheldon>"This is an ordinary top hat."

30
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,050
<1-11,Sheldon>"这张牌是你随便抽的哦"
<1-11,Sheldon>"You've chosen that card freely."

31
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,680
<1-11,Sheldon>"我的屁眼里可没夹着开锁工具哦"
<1-11,Sheldon>"I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister."

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,490
<1-12,Raj>你就不能享受一下奇迹的瞬间吗  谢尔顿
<1-12,Raj>Can't you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon?

33
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,180
<1-12,Raj>干吗一定要窥探揭秘呢
<1-12,Raj>Why must you peek behind the curtain?

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,810
<1-12,Raj>或是窥探人家的屁屁
<1-12,Raj>Or up the butt?

35
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,820
<1-13,Sheldon>跟小朋友说  帽子里变出了兔子
<1-13,Sheldon>If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children

36
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,210
<1-13,Sheldon>将会荼毒他们的批判性思维能力
<1-13,Sheldon>by telling them that rabbits come out of hats,

37
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,570
<1-13,Sheldon>他们成年后会相信占星术和顺势疗法
<1-13,Sheldon>then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy

38
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,620
<1-13,Sheldon>导致瑞安·雷诺兹就因此比
<1-13,Sheldon>and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice

39
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,520
<1-13,Sheldon>卖萌小混混  内森·菲利安更适合演《绿灯侠》
<1-13,Sheldon>for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,200
<1-13,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<1-13,Sheldon>Sheldon,

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
<1-14,Leonard>他只不过是给孩子们表演一点魔术而已
<1-14,Leonard>he's just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids.

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,730
<1-14,Leonard>不会害那些孩子长大变成
<1-14,Leonard>I really don't think they're gonna end up

43
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,480
<1-14,Leonard>喜欢雷诺兹版《绿灯侠》的白痴
<1-14,Leonard>liking the Green Lantern movie.

44
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,460
<1-15,Howard>别对他这么凶嘛
<1-15,Howard>Don't be so hard on him.

45
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,570
<1-15,Howard>他这么烦躁有情可原  因为他...
<1-15,Howard>It's natural to be a little cranky when you have...

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,910
<1-15,Howard>耳朵里有25美分
<1-15,Howard>a quarter in your ear!

47
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,250
<1-16,Sheldon>硬币塞在别人身上一点都不好笑
<1-16,Sheldon>Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement.

48
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,970
<1-16,Sheldon>我五岁时  比利·斯巴克斯将一枚
<1-16,Sheldon>When I was five, Billy Sparks put

49
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,150
<1-16,Sheldon>墨西哥比索塞进了我的鼻子
<1-16,Sheldon>a Mexican peso up my nose.

50
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,830
<1-17,Howard>等一下  这哪里不好笑啊
<1-17,Howard>Wait-wait-wait, how is that not amusing?

51
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,770
<1-18,Sheldon>到现在还没弄出来
<1-18,Sheldon>It's still there.

52
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,900
<1-18,Sheldon>害我每次要耗费45分钟才能过机场安检
<1-18,Sheldon>Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security.

53
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,670
<1-19,Howard>瞧  我把谢尔顿给变没了
<1-19,Howard>Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,840
<1-20,Leonard>下次就用把他变不见为开场吧
<1-20,Leonard>Next time, you should open with that.

64
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,390
<2-1,Penny>哎呀  那边在约会的是谁啊
<2-1,Penny>Ooh, look who's out on a date.

<2-2,Sheldon>"为什么来芝士蛋糕工厂吃饭是错误的选择"
<2-2,Sheldon>what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?

97
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,510
<2-12,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<2-12,Sheldon>Sheldon,

98
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,020
<2-13,Amy>我以唯一作者的身份在著名期刊上发表了
<2-13,Amy>I'm the sole author on a paper being published

99
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,590
<2-13,Amy>自己的论文  而且有可能改变
<2-13,Amy>in a distinguished journal that may change

100
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,030
<2-13,Amy>我研究的这个科学领域
<2-13,Amy>the course of my field.

<2-14,Sheldon>兴奋得都有些喘不过来气了
<2-14,Sheldon>Air's getting a bit thin up here.

103
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,310
<2-15,Penny>那么  准备好点菜了吗
<2-15,Penny>So, are we ready to order?

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,890
<2-16,Amy>稍等一下
<2-16,Amy>Give me a minute.

105
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,720
<2-16,Amy>我去整理一下仪容
<2-16,Amy>I'm gonna go wash up.

106
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,620
<2-17,Sheldon>好奇怪
<2-17,Sheldon>Well, that's odd.

107
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,290
<2-17,Sheldon>我们明明进来时就一起去了
<2-17,Sheldon>We both washed up when we came in.

108
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,810
<2-17,Sheldon>大概是排尿的委婉说法吧
<2-17,Sheldon>It's probably a euphemism for urination.

109
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,830
<2-18,Penny>谢尔顿  你有毛病啊
<2-18,Penny>Sheldon, what is wrong with you?

110
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,460
<2-19,Sheldon>没大有  当然  要说缺点的话
<2-19,Sheldon>Not much. Although, I can be faulted

111
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,990
<2-19,Sheldon>我就是太过于喜欢考拉熊了
<2-19,Sheldon>for being overly fond of koala bears.

112
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,340
<2-19,Sheldon>我也不知道怎么回事
<2-19,Sheldon>I don't know what it is,

113
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,140
<2-19,Sheldon>每当看到它们在桉树上大嚼特嚼时
<2-19,Sheldon>when they start munching on eucalyptus,

114
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,920
<2-19,Sheldon>我整个人都融化了
<2-19,Sheldon>I just melt inside.

115
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
<2-20,Penny>艾米刚告诉你一个好消息
<2-20,Penny>Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news,

116
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,610
<2-20,Penny>而你却表现得毫不在乎
<2-20,Penny>and you acted like it was no big deal.

117
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,640
<2-21,Sheldon>我知道你为什么会困惑
<2-21,Sheldon>Oh, I see why you're confused.

118
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,780
<2-21,Sheldon>她的消息听上去很重要  可你忘了
<2-21,Sheldon>No, her news sounded important, but what you're forgetting is,

119
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,630
<2-21,Sheldon>那是生物学领域的成就
<2-21,Sheldon>it was an achievement in the field of biology.

120
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,100
<2-21,Sheldon>都是恶心黏黏的东西
<2-21,Sheldon>That's all about yucky, squishy things.

121
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,560
<2-22,Penny>亲爱的  她生气了  你是他男朋友
<2-22,Penny>Honey, she's upset. You're her boyfriend.

122
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,140
<2-22,Penny>你至少也该试着
<2-22,Penny>You have to at least try to be excited

123
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,400
<2-22,Penny>为她高兴的事而高兴吧
<2-22,Penny>by the things she's excited by.

124
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
<2-23,Sheldon>如果我就是高兴不起来呢
<2-23,Sheldon>What if they simply don't excite me?

125
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,910
<2-24,Penny>那就想想考拉  然后笑一个
<2-24,Penny>Well, just smile and think about koalas.

126
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,880
<2-25,Sheldon>她立马就能识破
<2-25,Sheldon>She'd see right through that.

127
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,330
<2-25,Sheldon>我们经常去动物园
<2-25,Sheldon>We go to the zoo all the time.

128
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,370
<2-25,Sheldon>她知道我看考拉的脸
<2-25,Sheldon>She knows my koala face.

129
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,900
<2-25,Sheldon>以备将来参考  就是这样
<2-25,Sheldon>And for future reference, it's this.

130
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,470
<3-1,Bernadette>你有这么多魔术道具啊
<3-1,Bernadette>Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.

131
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,180
<3-1,Bernadette>对
<3-1,Bernadette>Yeah.

132
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,980
<3-2,Howard>我十几岁就开始玩魔术
<3-2,Howard>I started when I was a teenager.

133
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,320
<3-2,Howard>当年觉得可以先用小魔术泡妞
<3-2,Howard>I thought I could show a girl a few tricks

134
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,430
<3-2,Howard>再邀请她来房里看更多"好戏"
<3-2,Howard>and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.

135
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,130
<3-3,Bernadette>有用吗
<3-3,Bernadette>Did it work?

136
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,740
<3-4,Howard>这么说吧  唯一一"根"
<3-4,Howard>Ah, let's just say the only wand

137
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,220
<3-4,Howard>有看到好戏的"棒子"  是这根
<3-4,Howard>that ever saw any action was this one.

138
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,240
<3-4,Howard>看我妈为我们的表演做的
<3-4,Howard>Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.

139
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,770
<3-5,Bernadette>这布料不错啊
<3-5,Bernadette>I like the fabric.

140
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,830
<3-5,Bernadette>她从哪得来的
<3-5,Bernadette>Where'd she get it?

141
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,730
<3-6,Howard>她把一条旧泳衣剪了
<3-6,Howard>Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits.

142
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,440
<3-6,Howard>她做了这两件背心和六张餐巾
<3-6,Howard>She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.

143
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,060
<3-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>她试了背心吗
<3-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Has she tried on the vest yet?!

144
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,690
<3-8,Howard>我刚拿给她
<3-8,Howard>I just gave it to her!

145
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,840
<3-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>希望能合身  她身材不好量
<3-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I hope it fits-- she has a tricky figure!

146
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
<3-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>跟我一样又矮又巨乳
<3-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>She's short and stacked, like me!

147
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,630
<3-10,Howard>她才不算巨乳  老妈  她不会踩到自己的胸
<3-10,Howard>She's not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!

148
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,820
<3-11,Bernadette>华仔  我可能不太适合
<3-11,Bernadette>Listen, Howie, maybe I'm not the best choice

149
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,510
<3-11,Bernadette>当魔术师助手
<3-11,Bernadette>to be a magician's assistant.

150
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,210
<3-12,Howard>你肯定行  把那些环递给我
<3-12,Howard>You'll do fine. Hand me those rings?

151
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,290
<3-12,Howard>瞧  你做得多好
<3-12,Howard>See? You nailed it.

152
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,860
<3-13,Bernadette>我只是不太喜欢跟小孩子在一起
<3-13,Bernadette>You know, i-it's just that I'm not that comfortable with little kids.

153
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,070
<3-14,Howard>那是因为你很少跟他们玩
<3-14,Howard>Well, that's because you haven't been around them much.

154
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,980
<3-14,Howard>这是练习的好机会
<3-14,Howard>This is good practice. I mean,

155
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,560
<3-14,Howard>你总有一天要做妈妈的嘛
<3-14,Howard>you are gonna be a mom someday, right?

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,460
<3-15,Bernadette>这倒是
<3-15,Bernadette>Yeah, sure.

157
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,800
<3-16,Howard>我好久没看过这个了
<3-16,Howard>I haven't seen this trick in years.

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,470
<3-16,Howard>这叫鸽子锅
<3-16,Howard>It's called the dove pan.

159
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,630
<3-16,Howard>先让观众看锅是空的
<3-16,Howard>You let everyone see the pan is empty,

160
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,390
<3-16,Howard>但其实盖子里有个暗格
<3-16,Howard>but there's a secret compartment in the lid.

161
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,430
<3-16,Howard>然后打开变出一个活的...
<3-16,Howard>And then you open it and produce a live...

162
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,950
<3-16,Howard>千万别看里面
<3-16,Howard>Don't look in there.

163
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,550
<4-1,Leonard>在玩死亡救赎呢
<4-1,Leonard>Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?

164
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,610
<4-2,Sheldon>对
<4-2,Sheldon>Yes.

165
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,880
<4-3,Leonard>你怎么不做任务啊
<4-3,Leonard>How come you're not doing a mission?

166
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,800
<4-3,Leonard>只在那闲逛
<4-3,Leonard>You're just wandering around.

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,740
<4-4,Sheldon>今晚被郁闷了
<4-4,Sheldon>Had a rough night.

168
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,470
<4-4,Sheldon>我想散散步  清静一下
<4-4,Sheldon>I thought I'd go for a walk and clear my head.

169
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,250
<4-5,Leonard>正常人会出门散步
<4-5,Leonard>Some people go outside and do that.

170
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,870
<4-6,Sheldon>已经过九点了  这时候的帕萨迪纳街头
<4-6,Sheldon>It's after 9:00-- at this hour the streets of Pasadena

171
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,100
<4-6,Sheldon>到处是喝醉的水手和野猫
<4-6,Sheldon>are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.

172
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,180
<4-7,Leonard>要不要谈一谈
<4-7,Leonard>You want to talk about it?

173
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,210
<4-7,Leonard>不要
<4-7,Leonard>No.

174
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,800
<4-8,Sheldon>我还是进这家酒馆
<4-8,Sheldon>I think I'll just go in this saloon

175
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,860
<4-8,Sheldon>借酒浇愁吧
<4-8,Sheldon>and drink my troubles away.

176
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,520
<4-9,Leonard>电子酒精是解决不了问题的
<4-9,Leonard>You know digital alcohol is never a solution.

177
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,950
<4-9,Leonard>出什么事了
<4-9,Leonard>What's going on?

178
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,440
<4-10,Sheldon>说出来也没人信
<4-10,Sheldon>Hard as this may be to believe,

179
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,440
<4-10,Sheldon>我可能不是当男朋友的料
<4-10,Sheldon>it's possible that I'm not boyfriend material.

180
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,490
<4-11,Leonard>幸好我是坐着听的啊
<4-11,Leonard>Glad I was sitting down for that.

181
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,630
<4-11,Leonard>你跟艾米吵架啦
<4-11,Leonard>Did you and Amy get in a fight?

182
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,210
<4-12,Sheldon>艾米在吵  我可通情达理了
<4-12,Sheldon>Amy had a fight; I was being perfectly reasonable.

183
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,210
<4-12,Sheldon>我要喝杯威士忌
<4-12,Sheldon>I'm gonna have a whiskey.

184
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,500
<4-12,Sheldon>你要喝点什么吗
<4-12,Sheldon>Do you want anything?

185
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,370
<4-13,Leonard>不行  酒后不能开车
<4-13,Leonard>No, I can't.

186
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,600
<4-13,Leonard>我一会儿还要玩侠盗猎车手呢
<4-13,Leonard>I'm playing Grand Theft Auto later.

187
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,630
<4-13,Leonard>我虽然不懂女人
<4-13,Leonard>Look, I'm no expert in women...

188
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,120
<4-14,Sheldon>同意
<4-14,Sheldon>I'll say.

189
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,750
<4-15,Leonard>人家好心帮你  没必要这么损我吧
<4-15,Leonard>That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.

190
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,990
<4-16,Sheldon>对不起  酒后胡话  你接着说
<4-16,Sheldon>I'm sorry. It's the alcohol talking. Go on.

191
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,110
<4-17,Leonard>有时候  你得倾听女人的烦心事
<4-17,Leonard>Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them

192
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,790
<4-17,Leonard>然后让她们知道你能成长和改变
<4-17,Leonard>and then show them that you can grow and change.

193
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,380
<4-18,Sheldon>屁话  还有别的招吗
<4-18,Sheldon>Nuts to that. What else you got?

194
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,570
<4-19,Leonard>我不知道怎么跟你说
<4-19,Leonard>I don't know what to tell you.

195
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,960
<4-19,Leonard>买礼物给她呗
<4-19,Leonard>Buy her something.

196
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,410
<4-20,Sheldon>这有什么用
<4-20,Sheldon>How does that work?

197
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,550
<4-21,Leonard>略过任何修复感情的手段
<4-21,Leonard>Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection

198
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,450
<4-21,Leonard>直接用撒钱来赢回她的爱
<4-21,Leonard>and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.

199
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,990
<4-22,Sheldon>这方法完全是我谢尔顿·库珀的作风
<4-22,Sheldon>Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.

200
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,900
<4-23,Leonard>-不用谢我  -要谢谢你
<4-23,Leonard>- Glad I could help. - It's appreciated.

201
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,200
<4-24,Sheldon>如果你这辈子能再找到一个女人
<4-24,Sheldon>And if you ever manage to find a woman again,

202
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,260
<4-24,Sheldon>我也很乐意回报你
<4-24,Sheldon>I'll be glad to return the favor.

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,120
<5-1,Howard>现在  所有环都
<5-1,Howard>And now, all the rings are

204
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,240
<5-1,Howard>神奇地连起来了
<5-1,Howard>magically linked together.

205
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,580
<5-1,Howard>我未婚妻也戴着一个神奇的环
<5-1,Howard>My fiance's wearing a magic ring, too.

206
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,640
<5-1,Howard>把我的钱都变没了
<5-1,Howard>It made all my money disappear.

207
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,960
<5-2,Bernadette>哦  对
<5-2,Bernadette>Oh, ah, right.

209
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,810
<5-2,Bernadette>现在请看  奇妙霍迪尼的
<5-2,Bernadette>And now, the great Howdini's

210
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,380
<5-2,Bernadette>下一个神奇幻术
<5-2,Bernadette>next miraculous illusion.

211
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,600
<5-3,Child>我们什么时候能吃蛋糕
<5-3,Child>When are we gonna have cake?

212
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,070
<5-4,Bernadette>等你们完全被惊叹之后
<5-4,Bernadette>After you've been thoroughly amazed.

213
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,780
<5-5,Child>我们现在就想吃
<5-5,Child>But we want cake now.

214
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,560
<5-6,Bernadette>现在不给你们吃  懂了没
<5-6,Bernadette>Well, you're not getting cake right now, capisce?

215
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,550
<5-7,Howard>好了好了
<5-7,Howard>Okay. Okay.

216
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,730
<5-7,Howard>现在  我可爱的助手将递给我
<5-7,Howard>Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me

217
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,170
<5-7,Howard>一大罐普通的牛奶
<5-7,Howard>an ordinary pitcher of milk.

218
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,580
<5-8,Second child>我知道这个魔术是怎么变的
<5-8,Second child>I know how you do that trick.

219
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,010
<5-9,Bernadette>那你知道怎么把嘴闭上吗
<5-9,Bernadette>Do you know how to pipe down?

220
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,790
<5-10,Howard>好了  现在我要把
<5-10,Howard>Okay, we're going to

221
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,410
<5-10,Howard>这张报纸卷起来
<5-10,Howard>roll up this newspaper.

222
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,590
<5-11,Second child>那个牛奶罐是假的
<5-11,Second child>It's a fake pitcher.

223
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,870
<5-12,Bernadette>你耳朵被耳屎堵上了是吗
<5-12,Bernadette>You got wax in your ears?

224
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,780
<5-12,Bernadette>这男人都说了这是个普通的罐子
<5-12,Bernadette>The man said it's an ordinary pitcher.

225
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,810
<5-12,Bernadette>霍迪尼
<5-12,Bernadette>Howdini.

226
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,270
<5-13,Howard>好的  现在我要把报纸塞进这里
<5-13,Howard>Okay, we're going to stick this in here.

227
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,870
<5-13,Howard>然后把牛奶倒进去
<5-13,Howard>And then I'm going to pour in the milk.

228
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,530
<5-13,Howard>但愿这个魔术会成功
<5-13,Howard>I hope this works,

229
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,770
<5-13,Howard>我可没带多余的裤子来换
<5-13,Howard>because I didn't bring a change of pants.

230
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,390
<5-14,Second child>你看  我谷歌过了
<5-14,Second child>Look, I Googled it.

231
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,370
<5-14,Second child>那就是个假罐子
<5-14,Second child>It's a fake pitcher.

232
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,830
<5-15,Bernadette>够了
<5-15,Bernadette>That's it.

233
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,050
<5-15,Bernadette>你今天没蛋糕吃了
<5-15,Bernadette>No cake for you.

234
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,570
<5-15,Bernadette>还有谁也不想吃蛋糕的
<5-15,Bernadette>Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?

235
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,800
<5-16,Howard>她只是开玩笑而已的  孩子们
<5-16,Howard>She's just kidding, boys and girls.

236
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
<5-16,Howard>每个人都有蛋糕吃
<5-16,Howard>Everyone gets cake.

237
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,450
<5-17,Bernadette>他不许
<5-17,Bernadette>Not him.

238
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,800
<5-18,Howard>把罐子给我
<5-18,Howard>Just give me the pitcher.

239
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,190
<5-18,Howard>看好啦
<5-18,Howard>Behold!

240
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,780
<5-18,Howard>带错罐子了
<5-18,Howard>Wrong pitcher.

241
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,920
<6-1,Bernadette>我就说我跟小孩处不好嘛
<6-1,Bernadette>I told you I'm not good with kids.

242
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,030
<6-2,Howard>的确
<6-2,Howard>Yes, you did.

243
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,730
<6-2,Howard>我的裤裆好像开始结乳块了
<6-2,Howard>Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.

244
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,790
<6-3,Bernadette>是这样的  小时候我妈工作忙
<6-3,Bernadette>The thing is, my mother worked full-time.

245
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,480
<6-3,Bernadette>弟弟妹妹们都是由我照顾
<6-3,Bernadette>I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.

246
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,120
<6-4,Howard>所以呢
<6-4,Howard>Yeah, so?

247
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,740
<6-5,Bernadette>那简直糟透了
<6-5,Bernadette>Ugh, it was horrible!

248
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,340
<6-5,Bernadette>又得给他们擦鼻涕  又得换尿布
<6-5,Bernadette>With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers

249
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,780
<6-5,Bernadette>整天听着他们扯着嗓子抱怨
<6-5,Bernadette>and their little shrieky voices, always complaining.

250
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,370
<6-5,Bernadette>我不想穿衣服
<6-5,Bernadette>"I don't want to get dressed."

251
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,210
<6-5,Bernadette>乔伊老是往我嘴里吐口水
<6-5,Bernadette>"Joey keeps spitting in my mouth."

252
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,200
<6-5,Bernadette>妈妈不是这样做华夫饼的
<6-5,Bernadette>"This isn't the way Mom makes waffles."

253
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,180
<6-5,Bernadette>好吧  那你就把手放进烤饼机里
<6-5,Bernadette>Well, okay, put your hand in here.

254
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,390
<6-5,Bernadette>看你喜不喜欢这焦手饼
<6-5,Bernadette>Let's see how you like this waffle!

255
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,490
<6-6,Howard>好了  冷静点
<6-6,Howard>All right, settle down.

256
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,330
<6-6,Howard>红灯
<6-6,Howard>Red light.

257
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,800
<6-6,Howard>红灯  红灯
<6-6,Howard>Red light, red light!

258
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,150
<6-6,Howard>没事儿  没撞
<6-6,Howard>Okay, we're fine.

259
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,680
<6-6,Howard>对不起
<6-6,Howard>I'm sorry.

260
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,660
<6-7,Bernadette>我知道这话会让我听起来像是个恶人
<6-7,Bernadette>I know it makes me sound like a bad person,

261
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,560
<6-7,Bernadette>但我真的不喜欢小孩
<6-7,Bernadette>but I just don't like children.

262
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,760
<6-8,Howard>不  这点我们都心知肚明
<6-8,Howard>Yeah, no, we all got that.

263
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,070
<6-8,Howard>但是你不觉得如果是亲生的孩子
<6-8,Howard>But don't you think it'll be different

264
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,220
<6-8,Howard>情况就会不一样了吗
<6-8,Howard>when the child is ours?

265
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,930
<6-9,Bernadette>是啊  等咱们的孩子毁了我的体型
<6-9,Bernadette>Right, when it's our kid that's ruined my body

266
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,920
<6-9,Bernadette>吵着我睡不了觉  害得我没工作没前途
<6-9,Bernadette>and kept me up all night and I've got no career and no future

267
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,940
<6-9,Bernadette>而且在未来的二十年里毫无幸福可言
<6-9,Bernadette>and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years,

268
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,620
<6-9,Bernadette>情况当然是不一样了
<6-9,Bernadette>sure, that'll be completely different.

269
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,860
<6-10,Howard>是啊
<6-10,Howard>Well, yeah.

270
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,180
<7-1,Sheldon>这间珠宝店里的任何一件珠宝
<7-1,Sheldon>I don't think there's anything in this jewelry store

271
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,630
<7-1,Sheldon>都不可能比刚才
<7-1,Sheldon>that Amy would appreciate more

272
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,090
<7-1,Sheldon>看的那台增湿器更让艾米满心欢喜了
<7-1,Sheldon>than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.

273
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,340
<7-2,Penny>天啊  我算是知道我说傻话时
<7-2,Penny>Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you

274
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,990
<7-2,Penny>你的感受了
<7-2,Penny>when I say stupid stuff.

275
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,410
<7-3,Sheldon>怀表
<7-3,Sheldon>Ooh, a pocket watch.

276
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,160
<7-4,Penny>好吧  我不认为艾米会喜欢怀表
<7-4,Penny>Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.

277
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,410
<7-5,Sheldon>也许不会  但也许她会喜欢戴怀表的男人
<7-5,Sheldon>No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.

278
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,400
<7-6,Penny>还在说傻话
<7-6,Penny>Still saying stupid stuff.

279
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,560
<7-6,Penny>她喜欢手镯吗
<7-6,Penny>Does she like bracelets?

280
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,090
<7-7,Sheldon>她很喜欢她那个刻着
<7-7,Sheldon>Well, she's very fond of her silver one

281
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,150
<7-7,Sheldon>"青霉素过敏"的银手镯
<7-7,Sheldon>that says "Allergic to penicillin."

282
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,030
<7-7,Sheldon>没准他们这有差不多但是更讲究点的
<7-7,Sheldon>Maybe they have a dressier version of that?

283
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,070
<7-8,Assistant>下午好呀
<7-8,Assistant>Well, how are we doing this afternoon?

284
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,720
<7-8,Assistant>你们有什么特别的需要吗
<7-8,Assistant>Are we looking for anything special?

285
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,160
<7-8,Assistant>没准给这位美女买个戒指
<7-8,Assistant>Perhaps a ring for the lady?

286
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,410
<7-9,Penny>拜托  我们才不是情侣
<7-9,Penny>Trust me, we are not a couple.

287
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,970
<7-10,Sheldon>不好意思
<7-10,Sheldon>Excuse me.

288
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,270
<7-10,Sheldon>该嗤之以鼻的是我吧  哪轮得到你
<7-10,Sheldon>I don't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out.

289
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,450
<7-10,Sheldon>你要是泡到我这样的男人  得谢天谢地了
<7-10,Sheldon>You'd be lucky to land a fella like me.

290
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,680
<7-11,Penny>好吧  你说
<7-11,Penny>Fine, go ahead.

291
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,220
<7-12,Sheldon>拜托  我们才不是情侣
<7-12,Sheldon>Trust me, we are not a couple.

292
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,110
<7-13,Assistant>抱歉  有什么可以帮到二位的吗
<7-13,Assistant>My apologies. How can I help you today?

293
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,560
<7-14,Penny>他跟他女朋友吵架了
<7-14,Penny>He's in trouble with his girlfriend

294
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,030
<7-14,Penny>所以想给她买个礼物
<7-14,Penny>and needs to buy her a present.

295
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,380
<7-15,Assistant>好的  就是靠着男人买道歉礼物
<7-15,Assistant>Great, trouble with girlfriends

296
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,420
<7-15,Assistant>我才供得起我女儿读大学的
<7-15,Assistant>is what's putting my daughter through USC.

297
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,250
<7-16,Penny>这是真的钻石吗
<7-16,Penny>Ooh, are these real diamonds?

299
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,720
<7-17,Assistant>是的  槽镶长钻  总重二十分
<7-17,Assistant>Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.

300
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,120
<7-18,Sheldon>真神奇
<7-18,Sheldon>Remarkable.

301
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,800
<7-18,Sheldon>钻石  不过就是结晶状的碳而已
<7-18,Sheldon>Diamonds, crystallized carbon.

302
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,700
<7-18,Sheldon>人们每天去杂货店
<7-18,Sheldon>Every day, people go to the grocery store

303
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,010
<7-18,Sheldon>买回家的也是碳
<7-18,Sheldon>and come home with sacks full of carbon

304
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,520
<7-18,Sheldon>只不过是被人丢进烤炉
<7-18,Sheldon>in the form of charcoal briquettes

305
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
<7-18,Sheldon>当火源的炭块
<7-18,Sheldon>that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire.

306
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,820
<7-18,Sheldon>可你这只不过有几块
<7-18,Sheldon>But just because you've got some carbon

307
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,600
<7-18,Sheldon>分子排列整齐的碳
<7-18,Sheldon>with the atoms stacked neatly,

308
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,970
<7-18,Sheldon>你就指望我扔下几千美金来买
<7-18,Sheldon>you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.

309
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,010
<7-19,Assistant>实际上售价只有七百五十美金而已
<7-19,Assistant>Actually, that's only 750.

310
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,280
<7-19,Assistant>所有商品都打折
<7-19,Assistant>Everything's on sale.

311
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,120
<7-20,Sheldon>真的吗  给我介绍一下那块怀表吧
<7-20,Sheldon>Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.

312
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,340
<8-1,Howard>我还在琢磨那件事呢
<8-1,Howard>I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.

313
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,400
<8-1,Howard>我一直觉得我某天会当上爸爸的
<8-1,Howard>I always thought I'd be a dad someday.

314
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,570
<8-2,Raj>我也这么觉得
<8-2,Raj>Oh, me, too.

315
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,660
<8-2,Raj>你好有爱
<8-2,Raj>You're so caring.

316
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,160
<8-2,Raj>我脑海常浮现你把男孩抚育成男人的画面
<8-2,Raj>I've often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.

317
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,800
<8-3,Leonard>太好了  霍华德
<8-3,Leonard>There you go, Howard.

318
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,070
<8-3,Leonard>看来拉杰会替你生孩子的  问题解决了
<8-3,Leonard>Sounds like Raj'll have your babies; problem solved.

319
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,200
<8-4,Raj>一个男人对另一个男人表示关心
<8-4,Raj>Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man

320
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,660
<8-4,Raj>并不意味着是在向他表达
<8-4,Raj>doesn't mean he's displaying the love

321
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,220
<8-4,Raj>那种禁忌之爱
<8-4,Raj>that dare not speak its name.

322
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,460
<8-4,Raj>她明确说了不想要孩子吗
<8-4,Raj>Did she definitely say she didn't want kids?

323
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,420
<8-5,Howard>是啊  她十分不喜欢孩子
<8-5,Howard>Yeah, she doesn't like them.

324
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,150
<8-5,Howard>据我看来  孩子们也不喜欢她
<8-5,Howard>And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.

325
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,400
<8-6,Leonard>你打算怎么办
<8-6,Leonard>What are you gonna do?

326
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,490
<8-6,Leonard>我不知道
<8-6,Leonard>I don't know.

327
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,410
<8-7,Howard>我无法想象没有孩子的人生
<8-7,Howard>I can't see a life where I don't have kids.

328
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,060
<8-7,Howard>谁都有孩子啊
<8-7,Howard>I mean, people have kids.

329
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,610
<8-7,Howard>就连大金刚都有个娃  小大金刚
<8-7,Howard>I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr.

331
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,160
<8-7,Howard>有个孩子能让他教导如何绑架公主
<8-7,Howard>So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses

332
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,190
<8-7,Howard>和怎么朝那意大利籍水管工丢木桶
<8-7,Howard>and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.

333
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,190
<8-7,Howard>绑架公主与朝水管工马里奥丢木桶
<8-7,Howard>皆为大金刚经典游戏内容

334
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,150
<8-8,Leonard>但即使你有了孩子  也无法保证
<8-8,Leonard>You know, there's no guarantee even if you have kids

335
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,490
<8-8,Leonard>你就一定会喜欢他们啊
<8-8,Leonard>that you're going to like them.

336
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,820
<8-9,Raj>太可怕了  你从哪得来这感触的
<8-9,Raj>Wow, that's rough. Where'd you get that?

337
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,580
<8-10,Leonard>我妈最新著作封面上就写了这句话
<8-10,Leonard>It's right off the dust jacket of my mom's last book.

338
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,520
<8-11,Howard>或许我和伯纳黛特不合适
<8-11,Howard>Maybe me and Bernadette aren't right for each other.

339
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,200
<8-12,Leonard>霍华德  虽说海大何患无鱼
<8-12,Leonard>Look, Howard, I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea,

340
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,640
<8-12,Leonard>可我看着你晃着鱼钩钓了这么多年
<8-12,Leonard>but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years.

341
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,560
<8-12,Leonard>千万别放鱼归海啊
<8-12,Leonard>Do not throw her back.

342
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,870
<8-13,Howard>我也不想啊  可这事太破坏感情
<8-13,Howard>I don't want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.

343
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,020
<8-14,Raj>要是你妈知道你想取消婚礼会如何
<8-14,Raj>What's your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?

344
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,320
<8-15,Howard>她会气死的
<8-15,Howard>Oh, it'll kill her.

345
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,160
<8-15,Howard>但反过来说  她要知道以后没孙子抱
<8-15,Howard>On the other hand, if I don't give her grandchildren,

346
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,510
<8-15,Howard>也会气死的
<8-15,Howard>that'll kill her, too.

347
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,690
<8-15,Howard>不管怎么说  我妈会被气死这事我很有信心
<8-15,Howard>So, either way, on the Mom front, I'm golden.

348
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,890
<9-1,Sheldon>你跟艾米说让她几点来
<9-1,Sheldon>What time did you tell Amy to be here?

349
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,570
<9-1,Sheldon>八点
<9-1,Sheldon>8:00.

350
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,880
<9-2,Penny>谢尔顿  你那挂表太可笑了
<9-2,Penny>Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.

351
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,930
<9-3,Sheldon>胡说
<9-3,Sheldon>Nonsense.

352
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,700
<9-3,Sheldon>我戴着就像列车长
<9-3,Sheldon>I look like a train conductor.

353
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,090
<9-3,Sheldon>你用什么借口引诱她过来的
<9-3,Sheldon>Under what pretext did you lure her here?

354
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,250
<9-4,Penny>我说  想过来坐坐聊聊吗
<9-4,Penny>I said, "Hey, want to come over and hang out?"

355
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,860
<9-5,Sheldon>很好  你要说了什么有深度的理由
<9-5,Sheldon>Good, good, if you had said something clever,

356
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,530
<9-5,Sheldon>她可能就起疑心了的
<9-5,Sheldon>she might've gotten suspicious.

357
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,570
<9-8,Amy>他在这干嘛
<9-8,Amy>What's he doing here?

358
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,180
<9-9,Penny>他想跟你谈谈
<9-9,Penny>Okay, he wants to talk to you.

359
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,970
<9-10,Amy>可我不想跟他谈
<9-10,Amy>Well, I don't want to talk to him.

360
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,780
<9-10,Amy>现在我对你也很失望了
<9-10,Amy>And I'm pretty disappointed in you, too.

361
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,460
<9-10,Amy>虽然我也气不了你多久
<9-10,Amy>Although we both know that won't last.

362
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,420
<9-11,Penny>谢尔顿  该你了
<9-11,Penny>Sheldon, you're up.

363
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,410
<9-12,Sheldon>谢谢
<9-12,Sheldon>Thank you.

364
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,370
<9-12,Sheldon>艾米  我想跟你道歉
