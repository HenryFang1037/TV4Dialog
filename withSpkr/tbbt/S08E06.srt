00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,460
<1-1,Bernadette>我喜欢你的西装
<1-1,Bernadette>I like your suit.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,180
<1-2,Penny>谢谢  买了几身上班穿的新衣服
<1-2,Penny>Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,960
<1-3,Howard>你未婚妻的工作
<1-3,Howard>How does it feel knowing your fiancee's job

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,050
<1-3,Howard>是穿成那样去和医生调情
<1-3,Howard>is to go out and flirt with doctors,

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,980
<1-3,Howard>美艳动人
<1-3,Howard>looking like that,

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,110
<1-3,Howard>而你却是坐在这里
<1-3,Howard>while you sit here, you know...

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,260
<1-3,Howard>黯淡无光  你有何感想
<1-3,Howard>looking like this?

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,360
<1-4,Leonard>她没有和医生调情
<1-4,Leonard>She doesn't flirt with doctors.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,490
<1-5,Penny>是啊  我的工作可是相当专业
<1-5,Penny>Yeah. It's all very professional.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,690
<1-6,Amy>你弯腰的时候  我可以看见你的胸部
<1-6,Amy>You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,220
<1-7,Penny>很好
<1-7,Penny>Okay, good.

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,910
<1-8,Bernadette>说到新事业
<1-8,Bernadette>Speaking of new careers,

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,160
<1-8,Bernadette>你的暗物质研究进行得怎么样了  谢尔顿
<1-8,Bernadette>how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,620
<1-9,Sheldon>我得说此刻是这领域历史上
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, yeah, I'd have to say it's the most exiting time

15
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,200
<1-9,Sheldon>最激动人心的时刻
<1-9,Sheldon>in the history of the field.

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,020
<1-10,Bernadette>发生了什么
<1-10,Bernadette>What's going on?

17
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,450
<1-11,Sheldon>我加入了这领域
<1-11,Sheldon>I started doing it.

18
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,990
<1-12,Raj>政府资助要进行
<1-12,Raj>You know, the government funded

19
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,900
<1-12,Raj>目前为止最大的研究来探测暗物质
<1-12,Raj>the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,240
<1-13,Leonard>是的  我读过相关报道
<1-13,Leonard>Oh, yeah, I've read about that--

21
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,570
<1-13,Leonard>他们把研究小队送到废弃的盐矿里
<1-13,Leonard>they're sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.

22
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,290
<1-14,Raj>谢尔顿  如果我们能申请加入这些小队
<1-14,Raj>Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams,

23
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,940
<1-14,Raj>就能亲身参与到大事里...
<1-14,Raj>we could be on the ground floor of something big--

24
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,480
<1-14,Raj>理论物理学与天体物理学的大事
<1-14,Raj>not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,670
<1-15,Penny>等等  你们要去矿井里工作
<1-15,Penny>Wait, hang on-- you guys are gonna work in a mine?

26
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,570
<1-16,Sheldon>有何不可
<1-16,Sheldon>Why not?

27
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,060
<1-17,Penny>车子一开进自助洗车器  你恐慌症都发作了
<1-17,Penny>You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.

28
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,660
<1-18,Sheldon>你指的这种情绪应该是震惊之情
<1-18,Sheldon>Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock

29
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,830
<1-18,Sheldon>震惊自己居然会去清洁东西
<1-18,Sheldon>at you having something cleaned.

30
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,350
<1-19,Leonard>我想佩妮的意思是
<1-19,Leonard>I think what Penny meant is,

31
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,920
<1-19,Leonard>想到你俩下矿井的画面挺有趣的
<1-19,Leonard>the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny--

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,960
<1-19,Leonard>就像一只猫骑着自动吸尘机
<1-19,Leonard>it's like a cat riding a Roomba.

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,390
<1-19,Leonard>如果他们害怕了  就会戴上
<1-19,Leonard>If they get scared, they'll have those hats

34
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,200
<1-20,Bernadette>顶上有灯的帽子  因为矿井下面
<1-20,Bernadette>with the lights on them, 'cause down there

35
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,190
<1-20,Bernadette>一直都是黑黑的哟
<1-20,Bernadette>it's night-night all the time!

36
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,820
<1-20,Bernadette>他们也可以
<1-20,Bernadette>Maybe they could ride around

37
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,260
<1-20,Bernadette>坐在矿车里四处溜达
<1-20,Bernadette>in one of those mine carts that go,

38
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,480
<1-20,Bernadette>嘎吱嘎吱嘎吱
<1-20,Bernadette>ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.

39
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,950
<1-21,Leonard>对  看见鬼的时候也跑得更快
<1-21,Leonard>Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a gh-gh-ghost...!

40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,620
<1-22,Raj>-他们在取笑我俩吗  -对
<1-22,Raj>- Are they making fun of us? - Yup.

41
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,020
<1-23,Sheldon>好怀念我听不出言外之意的那些日子
<1-23,Sheldon>I miss the old days when I couldn't tell.

48
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,320
<2-1,Leonard>我最爱的电子游戏之一
<2-1,Leonard>So, one of my favorite video games of all time

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,940
<2-1,Leonard>叫做《汪达与巨像》
<2-1,Leonard>is called Shadow of the Colossus,

50
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,490
<2-1,Leonard>是PS2独占游戏
<2-1,Leonard>and it was only for PlayStation 2,

52
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,240
<2-1,Leonard>但是后来他们为PS3提供了
<2-1,Leonard>but then they came out with a new version

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,230
<2-1,Leonard>画质更好的新版本
<2-1,Leonard>for PS3 with better graphics.

54
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,510
<2-1,Leonard>我终于有机会玩这个游戏了
<2-1,Leonard>I finally got the chance to play it,

55
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,630
<2-1,Leonard>由于某些原因  PS3的版本并没有PS2的好
<2-1,Leonard>and for some reason, it just wasn't as good as the first one.

56
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,240
<2-1,Leonard>或者我们来聊瑜伽吧
<2-1,Leonard>Or something about yoga.

57
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,420
<2-2,Penny>对不起  我在想工作的事情
<2-2,Penny>I'm sorry-- I was thinking about work.

58
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,470
<2-3,Leonard>我刚在说  有个电子游戏...
<2-3,Leonard>Well, I was just saying that there was this video game...

59
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,110
<2-4,Penny>我就是从那个时候开始想工作的事情
<2-4,Penny>Yeah, that's when I started thinking about work.

60
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,030
<2-4,Penny>听着  我有个好消息
<2-4,Penny>Uh, listen, I've got some good news.

61
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,610
<2-6,Penny>这是给你的
<2-6,Penny>This is for you.

62
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,630
<2-7,Leonard>这是什么
<2-7,Leonard>What is this?

63
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,440
<2-8,Penny>你知道公司给我配了一辆车吧
<2-8,Penny>Well, you know how they gave me the company car?

64
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,090
<2-8,Penny>我没必要要两辆车  所以我卖了另外一辆
<2-8,Penny>Didn't make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.

65
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,460
<2-9,Leonard>你卖了我送你的那辆吗
<2-9,Leonard>The one I gave you?

66
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,790
<2-10,Penny>对  这是还你的钱
<2-10,Penny>Yeah. And there's your money back--

67
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,970
<2-10,Penny>现在我们两清了
<2-10,Penny>and now we're even.

68
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,970
<2-10,Penny>很棒吧
<2-10,Penny>How great is that?

69
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,850
<2-11,Leonard>是
<2-11,Leonard>Uh, yeah.

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,590
<2-12,Penny>怎么了
<2-12,Penny>What?

71
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,270
<2-13,Leonard>没什么
<2-13,Leonard>Nothing.

72
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,590
<2-14,Penny>莱纳德别这样
<2-14,Penny>Oh, come on, Leonard,

73
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,080
<2-14,Penny>我知道那辆车是你的好意
<2-14,Penny>I know the car was a thoughtful gesture

74
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,210
<2-14,Penny>我也很感激
<2-14,Penny>and I really appreciate it,

75
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,360
<2-14,Penny>但是我没必要坐拥两辆车
<2-14,Penny>but it doesn't make sense to have both.

76
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,580
<2-16,Penny>-你说得对  -那我应该怎么做
<2-16,Penny>- You're right. - What should I have done?

77
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,450
<2-16,Penny>拍一张咱俩在车里的照片
<2-16,Penny>Taken a picture of us in the car

78
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,590
<2-16,Penny>放进粉色相框里
<2-16,Penny>and put it in a pink frame

79
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,010
<2-16,Penny>周围用发泡彩笔写上"世上最好的未婚夫"吗
<2-16,Penny>with puffy paint around it that says "Best Fiance Ever"?

80
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,590
<2-17,Leonard>听起来不错啊
<2-17,Leonard>Doesn't sound that bad.

81
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,430
<2-18,Penny>很好  因为...我就是这么做了
<2-18,Penny>Well, good, because... that's why I did!

82
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,340
<2-19,Leonard>谢谢  你真是太好了
<2-19,Leonard>Thank you. That-that is so sweet.

83
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,540
<2-20,Penny>不  我其实没那么好
<2-20,Penny>No, it's not that sweet--

84
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,700
<2-20,Penny>我用你的钱买了相框
<2-20,Penny>I paid for the frame with your money

85
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,750
<2-20,Penny>还做了个按摩
<2-20,Penny>and then got a massage.

86
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,590
<2-21,Leonard>其实你不必给我钱
<2-21,Leonard>You know what, you don't have to give me this.

87
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,710
<2-21,Leonard>你留着吧
<2-21,Leonard>You keep it.

88
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,330
<2-23,Leonard>-为什么  -那辆车是我送你的礼物
<2-23,Leonard>- Why? - The car was a gift--

89
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,220
<2-23,Leonard>是你需要的东西
<2-23,Leonard>it was something you needed.

90
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,030
<2-23,Leonard>我很高兴能帮得上忙
<2-23,Leonard>I was happy to help you out.

91
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,390
<2-24,Penny>我真的很感激  不过我现在不需要了
<2-24,Penny>And I really appreciate it, but now I don't need it,

92
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,480
<2-24,Penny>你拿着吧
<2-24,Penny>so... here you go.

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,390
<2-25,Leonard>这样太蠢了  虽然你不需要车
<2-25,Leonard>Well, this is silly-- so you don't need the car,

94
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,250
<2-25,Leonard>不过你可以用这笔钱来买别的东西
<2-25,Leonard>but you could use it to buy yourself something else,

95
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,000
<2-25,Leonard>比如  买个钱包来放这些钱
<2-25,Leonard>like a... new purse to put all this money in.

96
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,900
<2-26,Penny>亲爱的  我自己有钱买东西
<2-26,Penny>Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff.

97
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,200
<2-26,Penny>我现在有份好工作
<2-26,Penny>I have a good job now.

98
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,320
<2-27,Leonard>我知道  我也以你为傲
<2-27,Leonard>I know, and I'm proud of you,

99
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,860
<2-27,Leonard>但我也可以为你做点事啊
<2-27,Leonard>but that doesn't mean I can't do something nice.

100
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,910
<2-27,Leonard>比如这样
<2-27,Leonard>Like this.

101
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,340
<2-28,Penny>我不想为了这事跟你吵架
<2-28,Penny>Okay, I don't want this to turn into a fight.

102
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,890
<2-29,Leonard>-我也不想  -很好
<2-29,Leonard>- I don't, either. - Great.

103
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,340
<2-30,Penny>谢谢
<2-30,Penny>Thank you.

104
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,540
<2-30,Penny>-能把盐给我吗  谢谢  -好的
<2-30,Penny>- Can you pass the salt, please? - Sure.

105
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,530
<2-31,Leonard>在我看来  这么做不仅用幽默打破了僵局
<2-31,Leonard>In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy

106
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,820
<2-31,Leonard>还会勾起性欲
<2-31,Leonard>and led to sex.

107
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,970
<3-1,Raj>谢尔顿  你忙吗
<3-1,Raj>Hey, Sheldon, you busy?

108
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,790
<3-2,Sheldon>我一直都很忙
<3-2,Sheldon>I'm always busy.

109
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,260
<3-2,Sheldon>我的大脑能够处理复杂的多重任务
<3-2,Sheldon>This mind is capable of advanced multitasking.

110
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,230
<3-2,Sheldon>最近我一直在致力于证实
<3-2,Sheldon>You know, currently, I'm attempting to solve

111
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,770
<3-2,Sheldon>彭罗斯猜想
<3-2,Sheldon>the Penrose conjecture,

113
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,100
<3-2,Sheldon>我还在构思我证实彭罗斯猜想后
<3-2,Sheldon>I'm composing my Nobel acceptance speech

114
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,640
<3-2,Sheldon>被授予诺贝尔奖时的获奖感言
<3-2,Sheldon>for when I've solved the Penrose conjecture,

115
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,190
<3-2,Sheldon>我还在想美人鱼怎么生孩子
<3-2,Sheldon>and I'm wondering how mermaids have babies.

116
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,250
<3-3,Raj>她们不是把蛋产在石头上的吗
<3-3,Raj>Don't they lay eggs on a rock?

117
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,980
<3-4,Sheldon>现在我的大脑有空位想新事情了
<3-4,Sheldon>Now I've got room for another thing.

118
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,510
<3-4,Sheldon>你有什么事
<3-4,Sheldon>What do you want?

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
<3-5,Raj>我对矿井里的情况
<3-5,Raj>So, I did a little research on what

120
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,460
<3-5,Raj>做了一些调查
<3-5,Raj>the conditions are like in the mines,

121
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,060
<3-5,Raj>他们可能说得对
<3-5,Raj>and the guys might be right--

122
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,410
<3-5,Raj>井下情况艰苦啊
<3-5,Raj>sounds pretty rough down there.

123
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,600
<3-5,Raj>首先  井下很潮湿
<3-5,Raj>For starters, it's very humid,

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,380
<3-5,Raj>气温在37度左右
<3-5,Raj>and about a hundred degrees.

125
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,230
<3-6,Sheldon>我来自德克萨斯州  你来自印度
<3-6,Sheldon>Well, I'm from Texas and you're from India--

126
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,770
<3-6,Sheldon>我们对腋下汗味一点都不陌生  下一个
<3-6,Sheldon>we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.

127
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,350
<3-7,Raj>第二  那是个活矿井
<3-7,Raj>It's also a live mine,

128
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,580
<3-7,Raj>所以远处可能会发生爆炸声
<3-7,Raj>so there'll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.

129
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,840
<3-8,Sheldon>我有一个患有乳糖不耐症
<3-8,Sheldon>Yeah, I have a lactose-intolerant roommate

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,060
<3-8,Sheldon>却还爱吃冰激凌的室友[放屁]  下一个
<3-8,Sheldon>with a taste for ice cream. Next.

131
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,180
<3-9,Raj>你每次得在底下待12个小时
<3-9,Raj>Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.

132
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,510
<3-10,Sheldon>那又怎样  反正都得找地方待
<3-10,Sheldon>Yeah? We have to be somewhere.

133
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,100
<3-11,Raj>对了  那里没厕所
<3-11,Raj>Well, there's no toilets--

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,890
<3-11,Raj>我们都得排泄在一个桶里
<3-11,Raj>we'll have to do our business in a bucket.

135
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,130
<3-12,Sheldon>答案揭晓  我们不去了
<3-12,Sheldon>So it's settled-- we're not doing it.

136
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,050
<3-13,Raj>我明白  但是...
<3-13,Raj>Look, I get it, but...

137
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,560
<3-13,Raj>在拒绝这个难得的机会之前
<3-13,Raj>before we pass up on an incredible opportunity,

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,860
<3-13,Raj>我想到在霍华德上太空之前
<3-13,Raj>I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space,

139
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,090
<3-13,Raj>曾在一个模拟环境里受训
<3-13,Raj>they put him in a simulated environment.

140
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,700
<3-14,Sheldon>有意思
<3-14,Sheldon>Interesting.

141
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,740
<3-14,Sheldon>你是建议我们
<3-14,Sheldon>You're suggesting that we recreate

142
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,260
<3-14,Sheldon>重现一下矿井的坏境
<3-14,Sheldon>the conditions of the mine

143
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,270
<3-14,Sheldon>-看看咱俩能否适应吗  -对
<3-14,Sheldon>- to see if we can handle it. - Exactly.

144
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,610
<3-17,Raj>-不错嘛  -我们该去哪里实验呢
<3-17,Raj>- Very well. - So where should we do it?

145
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,040
<3-18,Sheldon>我来搜"炙热[热辣]  黑暗[黑皮肤]  湿润"几个关键词
<3-18,Sheldon>Well, I'll just Google "Hot, dark and moist,"

146
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,710
<3-18,Sheldon>看看能搜出什么
<3-18,Sheldon>see what comes up.

147
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,860
<3-19,Raj>谢尔顿
<3-19,Raj>Uh, Sheldon...

148
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,310
<3-20,Sheldon>快看  搜出了好多视频呢
<3-20,Sheldon>Oh, there, well, look, there's all kinds of videos.

149
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,010
<4-1,Leonard>你有空吗
<4-1,Leonard>Hey, you got a sec?

150
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,140
<4-2,Penny>当然有
<4-2,Penny>Hi. Sure.

151
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,270
<4-3,Leonard>我希望能再谈一下那些钱的事
<4-3,Leonard>I was hoping we could talk about the money again.

152
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,770
<4-4,Penny>-亲爱的  算了吧  -不  不行
<4-4,Penny>- Oh, sweetie, just forget about it. - No, no, no, no,

153
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,150
<4-5,Leonard>听我说  我知道昨晚事情发展得有点诡异
<4-5,Leonard>hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.

154
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,060
<4-6,Penny>上完床后在我床头柜上
<4-6,Penny>Well, leaving an envelope full of cash

155
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,730
<4-6,Penny>留下装满钱的信封
<4-6,Penny>on my dresser after sex

156
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,880
<4-6,Penny>的确算得上诡异
<4-6,Penny>would count as weird.

157
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,230
<4-7,Leonard>我想出了一个很好的解决办法
<4-7,Leonard>Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.

158
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,850
<4-9,Leonard>我们何不把这钱存进一个共同账户里
<4-9,Leonard>Why don't we just put the money in a joint account?

159
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,110
<4-9,Leonard>这将是我俩第一笔共同资产
<4-9,Leonard>It'll be our first money together.

160
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,680
<4-9,Leonard>我们可以用它办婚礼  蜜月旅行  什么都可以
<4-9,Leonard>We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.

161
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,670
<4-10,Penny>这主意太好了  我喜欢
<4-10,Penny>You know what, that's great. I love that!

162
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,860
<4-11,Leonard>你当然会喜欢啦
<4-11,Leonard>Yeah, of course you do--

163
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,260
<4-11,Leonard>我可不止是床上小天才哦
<4-11,Leonard>I'm not just a genius in bed.

164
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,310
<4-11,Leonard>你当然是啦  宝贝
<4-11,Leonard>You sure are, baby.

165
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,550
<4-12,Penny>你要和这笔钱独处一下吗
<4-12,Penny>You two want to be alone?

166
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,250
<4-13,Leonard>我明白你不愿意留着这笔钱的原因
<4-13,Leonard>I want you to know I get why you don't want the money--

167
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,940
<4-13,Leonard>你找到了新工作  你很高兴
<4-13,Leonard>you've got this new job, you're excited

168
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,590
<4-13,Leonard>自己终于经济独立了
<4-13,Leonard>about being financially independent--

169
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,650
<4-13,Leonard>我也无比为你感到骄傲
<4-13,Leonard>and I am nothing but proud of you.

170
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,410
<4-13,Leonard>谢谢你
<4-13,Leonard>Oh, thank you so much.

171
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,420
<4-14,Penny>听你这么说真是太开心了
<4-14,Penny>It feels so good to hear you say that.

172
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,370
<4-13,Leonard>我也希望你知道
<4-13,Leonard>And I want you to know

173
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,070
<4-14,Penny>我有了工作以后
<4-14,Penny>that I get this job kind of changes

174
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,650
<4-14,Penny>我俩之间的平衡发生了改变
<4-14,Penny>the balance in our relationship,

175
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,340
<4-14,Penny>我也在小心翼翼地处理这件事
<4-14,Penny>and... I'm trying to be sensitive to that.

176
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,920
<4-15,Leonard>什么意思
<4-15,Leonard>What?

177
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,370
<4-16,Penny>我只是觉得也许你纠结这笔钱
<4-16,Penny>Well, I just think that maybe you're a little hung up

178
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,430
<4-16,Penny>是因为我现在不再依赖你了
<4-16,Penny>on the money because I'm less reliant on you now,

179
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,440
<4-16,Penny>所以你感到害怕了
<4-16,Penny>and that's a little scary.

180
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,550
<4-19,Leonard>可能吧
<4-19,Leonard>Maybe.

181
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,830
<4-17,Leonard>也有可能我是想对你好一点
<4-17,Leonard>Or maybe I tried to do something nice

182
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,800
<4-17,Leonard>结果可能你反而适应不了
<4-17,Leonard>and maybe you had a problem with it

183
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,220
<4-17,Leonard>因为你是个控制狂
<4-17,Leonard>because of your control issues.

184
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,310
<4-18,Penny>控制狂
<4-18,Penny>Control issues?

185
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,290
<4-19,Leonard>可能吧
<4-19,Leonard>Maybe.

186
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,340
<4-19,Leonard>也有...可能
<4-19,Leonard>Or... maybe...

187
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,680
<4-20,Penny>现在我不再是失业的演员
<4-20,Penny>now that I'm no longer an out-of-work actress

188
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,340
<4-20,Penny>不会再付不起自己的饭钱
<4-20,Penny>who can't pay for her own dinner,

189
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,670
<4-20,Penny>让你有点没安全感了
<4-20,Penny>that makes you a little insecure.

190
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,810
<4-21,Leonard>真不敢相信你会这么说
<4-21,Leonard>Well, I can't believe you'd say that.

191
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,610
<4-21,Leonard>你明知道我对于"没安全感"这事特别没安全感
<4-21,Leonard>You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.

192
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,920
<4-22,Penny>好吧  对不起
<4-22,Penny>You know what? I'm sorry.

193
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,420
<4-22,Penny>为钱吵架这种事太愚蠢了
<4-22,Penny>It's stupid to fight over money.

194
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,650
<4-23,Leonard>我也很抱歉
<4-23,Leonard>Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

195
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,210
<4-23,Leonard>我们还要一起共度余生呢
<4-23,Leonard>We're about to share the rest of our lives together.

196
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,430
<4-23,Leonard>这是我俩的钱  谁拿着又有什么关系
<4-23,Leonard>It's our money-- who cares who has it?

197
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,630
<4-24,Penny>你说得对  有什么关系呢
<4-24,Penny>Ugh! You're right-- who cares?

198
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,080
<4-24,Penny>把钱从我裤子口袋拿出来
<4-24,Penny>Get that money out of my back pocket

199
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,300
<4-24,Penny>否则我拧断你手指
<4-24,Penny>or I will break your fingers.

200
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,620
<5-1,Raj>我从来不知道
<5-1,Raj>All this time I never knew

201
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,290
<5-1,Raj>这下面里有蒸汽通道
<5-1,Raj>there were steam tunnels down here.

202
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,070
<5-2,Amy>大部分大学都有这个
<5-2,Amy>Most universities have them.

203
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,010
<5-2,Amy>我读大学时  为求加入姐妹会
<5-2,Amy>When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one

204
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,050
<5-2,Amy>曾在里面待了3天
<5-2,Amy>pledging a sorority.

205
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,330
<5-3,Raj>最后你加入了吗
<5-3,Raj>Did you get in?

206
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,600
<5-4,Amy>没  她们忘记了我在下面
<5-4,Amy>No. They forgot I was there.

207
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,370
<5-4,Amy>但我浑身的毛孔都被蒸开了
<5-4,Amy>But it really opened up my pores.

208
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,410
<5-5,Sheldon>根据我的调查
<5-5,Sheldon>Well, according to my research,

209
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,470
<5-5,Sheldon>这个入口下面的蒸汽通道
<5-5,Sheldon>the steam tunnels below this access point

210
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,270
<5-5,Sheldon>和矿井的环境最为相似
<5-5,Sheldon>should be the closest analog to the mines.

211
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,570
<5-6,Raj>这个会比健身房里的桑拿房
<5-6,Raj>This is gonna be so much more accurate

212
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,950
<5-6,Raj>更接近真实环境吧
<5-6,Raj>than the steam room at the gym.

213
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,150
<5-7,Sheldon>而且我们基本不可能看到
<5-7,Sheldon>Plus, there's almost no chance

214
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,210
<5-7,Sheldon>任何一位同事的半裸
<5-7,Sheldon>we'll see any of our coworkers half naked.

215
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,310
<5-8,Raj>或者是全裸
<5-8,Raj>Or totally naked.

216
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,050
<5-8,Raj>我爱霍华德
<5-8,Raj>I love Howard,

217
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,570
<5-8,Raj>可这混小子真是毫无节操啊
<5-8,Raj>but the dude needs a little shame.

218
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,390
<5-9,Sheldon>好了  艾米  这是你的对讲机
<5-9,Sheldon>All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours.

219
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,080
<5-9,Sheldon>如果我们遇到问题  我就联系你
<5-9,Sheldon>If we run into any problems, I'll contact you.

220
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,530
<5-9,Sheldon>如果有情况发生  还记得规矩吗
<5-9,Sheldon>And if anything bad happens, what's the rule?

221
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,340
<5-10,Amy>先救你  有时间的话再回来救拉杰
<5-10,Amy>Save you first; come back for Raj only if there's time.

222
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,850
<5-11,Raj>我们不会有事的
<5-11,Raj>We're going to be fine.

223
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,670
<5-12,Amy>谢尔顿  我非常惊讶
<5-12,Amy>Sheldon, I'm really impressed

224
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,230
<5-12,Amy>你居然愿意来亲身体验
<5-12,Amy>you're willing to try this.

225
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,430
<5-13,Sheldon>不可否认  此举触及到了我所有广为人知的死穴
<5-13,Sheldon>Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions

226
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,560
<5-13,Sheldon>怕热  怕狭窄
<5-13,Sheldon>to heat, small places,

227
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,070
<5-13,Sheldon>怕往地下走
<5-13,Sheldon>going below floor-level,

228
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,560
<5-13,Sheldon>怕湿  怕舱口  怕梯子
<5-13,Sheldon>dampness, hatches, ladders,

229
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,420
<5-13,Sheldon>怕黑  怕回声
<5-13,Sheldon>darkness, echoes,

230
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,670
<5-13,Sheldon>还有怕在塑料桶里排泄
<5-13,Sheldon>and eliminating in Home Depot buckets.

231
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,320
<5-13,Sheldon>最后这项是新添的  但我感觉
<5-13,Sheldon>That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling

232
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,190
<5-13,Sheldon>它将压倒群雄  荣登名单宝座
<5-13,Sheldon>that's gonna rocket to the top of the list.

233
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,090
<5-14,Raj>我已经开始出汗了
<5-14,Raj>I'm sweating already.

234
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:00,020
<5-15,Sheldon>我就在你下面  所以我感觉到了
<5-15,Sheldon>Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.

235
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,380
<5-16,Raj>这里有多热
<5-16,Raj>How hot is it?

236
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,460
<5-17,Sheldon>我看看  704度
<5-17,Sheldon>Uh, let's see. 704?

237
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,780
<5-17,Sheldon>不对  我看的是时间
<5-17,Sheldon>No, wait, it's on "Clock."

238
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,130
<5-17,Sheldon>真正的答案也好不到哪里去
<5-17,Sheldon>No, the real answer isn't much better.

239
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,800
<5-17,Sheldon>102华氏度[38.9摄氏度]
<5-17,Sheldon>102 degrees.

240
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,870
<5-18,Raj>这就是我们想要的
<5-18,Raj>Well, that's what we wanted.

241
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,110
<5-18,Raj>-和矿井差不多热  -没错
<5-18,Raj>- This is as hot as the mines will be. - True.

242
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,080
<5-19,Sheldon>谢尔顿矿井模拟日志  第一条
<5-19,Sheldon>Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log, entry one.

243
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,290
<5-19,Sheldon>库斯拉帕里老是重新叙述一些明摆的事情
<5-19,Sheldon>Koothrappali's restating of the obvious

244
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,950
<5-19,Sheldon>已经开始让我火大了
<5-19,Sheldon>is already getting on my nerves.

245
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,240
<6-1,Leonard>谢谢邀请我们来你们家做客
<6-1,Leonard>Thanks again for having us.

246
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,840
<6-2,Howard>别客气  你们俩想问什么事啊
<6-2,Howard>Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?

247
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,870
<6-3,Penny>你们也知道我们已经订婚了
<6-3,Penny>Well, you know, now that we're engaged,

248
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,980
<6-3,Penny>所以想咨询你们一下
<6-3,Penny>we had some questions about

249
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,750
<6-3,Penny>夫妻之间如何处理金钱
<6-3,Penny>how you handle money as a couple.

250
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,350
<6-4,Bernadette>看吧  就说他们不是来邀我们玩换妻游戏
<6-4,Bernadette>I told you they weren't gonna ask us to swing with them.

251
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,440
<6-5,Howard>我本来就觉得不是啊
<6-5,Howard>I didn't think they were going to.

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,940
<6-5,Howard>我只是怕伤莱纳德自尊
<6-5,Howard>I just wanted to have a way to say no

253
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,570
<6-5,Howard>提前想好怎么拒绝而已
<6-5,Howard>without hurting Leonard's feelings.

254
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,700
<6-6,Leonard>好吧  干得好
<6-6,Leonard>Well... nailed it.

255
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,540
<6-7,Howard>你们想知道什么
<6-7,Howard>So what did you want to know?

256
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,260
<6-8,Penny>你们俩有曾经为钱吵过架吗
<6-8,Penny>Well, do you guys ever fight over money?

257
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,990
<6-9,Bernadette>当然有时候会啊
<6-9,Bernadette>Sure, sometimes.

258
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,250
<6-9,Bernadette>怎么说呢  多少会有一点别扭吧
<6-9,Bernadette>I mean, it can be a little awkward

259
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,000
<6-9,Bernadette>毕竟我现在挣钱比华仔多那么多
<6-9,Bernadette>since I make so much more money than Howie.

260
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,540
<6-10,Howard>你也没必要说"多那么多"吧
<6-10,Howard>You didn't have to say "so much more."

261
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,350
<6-11,Bernadette>是没必要  但是为了准确起见
<6-11,Bernadette>Well, I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy

262
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,630
<6-11,Bernadette>我觉得我应该这么说
<6-11,Bernadette>I felt that I should.

263
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,350
<6-12,Howard>我也为这段婚姻购置了很多重大资产好吗
<6-12,Howard>I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.

264
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,080
<6-13,Bernadette>比如说
<6-13,Bernadette>Like what?

265
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,760
<6-13,Bernadette>你那套不完整的《星际迷航》收藏挂盘吗
<6-13,Bernadette>Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?

266
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,900
<6-14,Howard>忘了告诉你  我刚在易趣上买了最后一个
<6-14,Howard>For your information, I just bought the last one

267
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,060
<6-14,Howard>现在一套齐了
<6-14,Howard>I needed on eBay.

268
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,850
<6-15,Bernadette>不用跟老婆请示吗
<6-15,Bernadette>Without asking me?

269
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,290
<6-16,Howard>当时拍卖就剩三分钟了
<6-16,Howard>There were only three minutes left in the auction

270
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,210
<6-16,Howard>而且那个史考特挂盘是全新的
<6-16,Howard>and it was a mint condition Scotty

271
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,640
<6-16,Howard>而且卖家家里还不抽烟
<6-16,Howard>from a smoke-free home.

272
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,570
<6-17,Bernadette>多少钱  华仔
<6-17,Bernadette>How much, Howie?

273
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,690
<6-18,Howard>不多啦
<6-18,Howard>Not a lot.

274
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,880
<6-19,Bernadette>到底多少
<6-19,Bernadette>How much?

275
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,100
<6-20,Howard>我们别当着朋友的面说这个行吗
<6-20,Howard>Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.

276
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,040
<6-21,Bernadette>比去训鹰学校贵还是便宜
<6-21,Bernadette>Was it more or less than falconry school?

277
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,470
<6-22,Howard>我再说第十次  那是在团购网上团的
<6-22,Howard>For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.

278
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,140
<6-23,Leonard>鬼才愿意跟他换妻咧
<6-23,Leonard>Like I would swing with him.

279
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,290
<7-1,Raj>感觉如何
<7-1,Raj>How you feeling?

280
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,510
<7-1,Raj>还好
<7-1,Raj>Good.

281
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,590
<7-2,Sheldon>幽闭恐惧症有点发作
<7-2,Sheldon>Little claustrophobic.

282
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,820
<7-3,Raj>那赶快装设备
<7-3,Raj>Let's set up the equipment.

283
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,250
<7-3,Raj>这有助于转移你的注意力
<7-3,Raj>It'll help take your mind off of it.

284
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,220
<7-4,Sheldon>矿工经常会唱矿歌  让自己打起精神来
<7-4,Sheldon>Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.

285
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,620
<7-5,Raj>你会唱矿歌吗
<7-5,Raj>Do you know any mining songs?

286
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,640
<7-6,Sheldon>只记得热榜矿歌
<7-6,Sheldon>Just the hits.

287
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,230
<7-6,Sheldon>* 这里暗如地牢 *
<7-6,Sheldon>* Where it's dark as a dungeon *

289
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,400
<7-6,Sheldon>* 这里湿如露珠 *
<7-6,Sheldon>* And it's damp as the dew *

290
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,240
<7-7,Rajj>歌词很美
<7-7,Rajj>That's pretty.

291
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,760
<7-8,Sheldon>* 这里危险重重 *
<7-8,Sheldon>* Where the dangers are double *

292
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,930
<7-8,Sheldon>* 这里乐趣少少 *
<7-8,Sheldon>* And the pleasures are few *

293
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,470
<7-8,Sheldon>* 这里没有雨水 *
<7-8,Sheldon>* Where the rain never falls *

294
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,130
<7-8,Sheldon>* 这里缺乏阳光 *
<7-8,Sheldon>* And the sun never shines *

295
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,820
<7-8,Sheldon>* 没错  这里暗如地牢 *
<7-8,Sheldon>* Yes, it's dark as a dungeon *

296
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,260
<7-8,Sheldon>* 这里就是矿井 *
<7-8,Sheldon>* Way down in the mine *

297
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,740
<7-9,Raj>这歌词比我想象中要凄凉啊
<7-9,Raj>It's a little more bleak than I thought.

298
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,050
<7-10,Sheldon>* 死时祈祷 *
<7-10,Sheldon>* Well, I pray when I dead *

299
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,550
<7-10,Sheldon>* 时代变迁 *
<7-10,Sheldon>* And the ages shall roll *

300
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,590
<7-10,Sheldon>* 肉身变黑 *
<7-10,Sheldon>* That my body will blacken *

301
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,890
<7-10,Sheldon>* 化为煤炭 *
<7-10,Sheldon>* And turn into coal *

302
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,260
<7-11,Raj>歌词变阴森了
<7-11,Raj>Getting kind of grim.

303
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,160
<7-12,Sheldon>* 我在天国 *
<7-12,Sheldon>* Then I'll look from the door *

304
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,740
<7-12,Sheldon>* 望向地牢 *
<7-12,Sheldon>* Of my heavenly home *

305
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,260
<7-12,Sheldon>* 可怜矿工 *
<7-12,Sheldon>* And pity the miner *

306
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,680
<7-12,Sheldon>* 开采我骨 *
<7-12,Sheldon>* That mines my poor bones. *

307
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,320
<7-13,Raj>够了  不如唱两首小天后麦莉·赛勒斯的歌吧
<7-13,Raj>Okay. How 'bout a little Miley Cyrus next?

308
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,950
<7-13,Raj>美国年轻女明星  早期演出青春剧《汉娜·蒙塔纳》
<7-13,Raj>现在则是走疯狂怪诞女歌手路线

309
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,950
<7-14,Sheldon>他是哪位
<7-14,Sheldon>Who's he?

310
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,550
<8-1,Howard>说到乱花钱
<8-1,Howard>Talk about wasted money.

311
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,390
<8-1,Howard>怎么不说说我们信用卡之所以要交滞纳金
<8-1,Howard>What about the late fees on our credit card

312
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,220
<8-1,Howard>是因为有人总是不按时还款
<8-1,Howard>because somebody didn't pay the bill on time?

313
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,460
<8-2,Bernadette>或许我不用操心
<8-2,Bernadette>Well, maybe I would have paid it

314
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,900
<8-2,Bernadette>家里所有家务时  我会记得按时还款
<8-2,Bernadette>if I wasn't also doing everything else around here.

315
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,510
<8-3,Howard>你的意思是  我一点家务都不做吗
<8-3,Howard>Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here.

316
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,870
<8-3,Howard>请看我的家务清单
<8-3,Howard>Look at my chore chart.

317
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,470
<8-4,Leonard>-她居然给他列了家务清单  -看见了
<8-4,Leonard>- She made him a chore chart. - I see it.

318
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,390
<8-6,Howard>"洗碗"  上面还有朵小红花呢
<8-6,Howard>"Do the dishes." There's a star right there.

319
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,230
<8-7,Bernadette>那是安慰小红花  往烤盘里倒点水
<8-7,Bernadette>That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan

320
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,690
<8-7,Bernadette>然后扔到洗碗池里不叫"洗碗"
<8-7,Bernadette>and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.

321
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,770
<8-8,Howard>你明知道那烤盘洗之前要泡一下
<8-8,Howard>That pan had to soak and you know it.

322
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,670
<8-9,Bernadette>等你领不到零用钱时
<8-9,Bernadette>Well, don't come crying to me

323
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,770
<8-9,Bernadette>可别哭着来求我
<8-9,Bernadette>when you don't get your allowance.

324
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,480
<8-10,Howard>那不是零用钱
<8-10,Howard>It's not an allowance.

325
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,520
<8-10,Howard>那是家用
<8-10,Howard>It's a stipend!

326
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,460
<8-10,Howard>我们说好不在我朋友面前
<8-10,Howard>And we said we weren't gonna call it an allowance

327
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,970
<8-10,Howard>提那叫零用钱的事
<8-10,Howard>in front of my friends.

328
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,600
<8-11,Leonard>我以前不爱吃柠檬棒
<8-11,Leonard>I usually don't like lemon bars,

329
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
<8-11,Leonard>但你家的真的很好吃
<8-11,Leonard>but th-these are really good.

330
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,750
<9-1,Raj>化身汉娜·蒙塔娜时
<9-1,Raj>So, as Hannah Montana,

331
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,850
<9-1,Raj>麦莉是一名风靡全球的流行偶像
<9-1,Raj>Miley was a world-famous pop star.

332
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,760
<9-1,Raj>但平时的她会脱下假发  像普通女孩那样
<9-1,Raj>But then she would take off her wig and go to school

333
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,730
<9-1,Raj>去上学
<9-1,Raj>like a normal girl.

334
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,040
<9-1,Raj>不用我说你也知道
<9-1,Raj>Which, I don't have to tell you,

335
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,920
<9-1,Raj>在那个年纪  光学校的事就很多烦恼了
<9-1,Raj>at that age, is its own headache.

336
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,390
<9-2,Sheldon>那也太荒谬了
<9-2,Sheldon>That's preposterous.

337
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,440
<9-2,Sheldon>怎么可能她一戴上假发  人们就认不出她了呢
<9-2,Sheldon>How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?

338
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,590
<9-3,Raj>那你怎么不质疑  为什么超人戴上眼镜
<9-3,Raj>But you're okay with Superman concealing his identity

339
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,880
<9-3,Raj>就能隐藏自己身份呢
<9-3,Raj>with a pair of glasses?

340
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,720
<9-4,Sheldon>他不光只是戴上一副眼镜这么简单
<9-4,Sheldon>He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses.

341
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,350
<9-4,Sheldon>他前额那一小撮卷发没了
<9-4,Sheldon>He combs back his curlicue

342
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,980
<9-4,Sheldon>性格也变得温文尔雅
<9-4,Sheldon>and affects a mild-mannered personality.

343
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,320
<9-5,Amy (shouting)>你们俩在下面还好吗
<9-5,Amy (shouting)>You guys doing okay down there?

344
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,440
<9-6,Sheldon>都说要用对讲机啦
<9-6,Sheldon>I told you to use the walkie-talkie!

345
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,800
<9-5,Amy (shouting)>你们俩在下面还好吗
<9-5,Amy (shouting)>You guys doing okay down there?

346
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,040
<9-8,Sheldon>对讲机是用来应急  不是用来闲聊的
<9-8,Sheldon>Please keep this channel clear for emergencies.

347
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,480
<9-8,Sheldon>谢谢
<9-8,Sheldon>Thank you.

348
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,970
<9-9,Amy>我要去自动贩卖机那  你们需要什么吗
<9-9,Amy>I'm going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?

349
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,610
<9-10,Sheldon>这是模拟实验
<9-10,Sheldon>This is a simulation.

350
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,900
<9-10,Sheldon>我们必须靠我们带来的物品生存
<9-10,Sheldon>We have to survive on the supplies we brought.

351
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,540
<9-11,Amy>好吧  我就问问
<9-11,Amy>Okay, just checking.

352
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,230
<9-12,Raj>我们应该让她买点洋葱圈玉米片
<9-12,Raj>We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.

353
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,240
<9-13,Sheldon>当我们在真的矿坑里时
<9-13,Sheldon>You're not going to have Funyuns

354
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,380
<9-13,Sheldon>你哪来的洋葱圈玉米片吃啊
<9-13,Sheldon>when we're a mile below the surface of the Earth.

355
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,900
<9-14,Raj>如果是我们下矿坑时就带了的呢
<9-14,Raj>What if we brought them down with us?

356
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,460
<9-15,Sheldon>给我们买点洋葱圈玉米片
<9-15,Sheldon>We'll take some Funyuns.

357
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,010
<9-16,Amy>还要别的吗
<9-16,Amy>Anything else?

358
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,280
<9-17,Sheldon>还有约克薄荷饼
<9-17,Sheldon>Some York Peppermint Patties,

359
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,900
<9-17,Sheldon>两瓶胡椒博士汽水  还有...
<9-17,Sheldon>a couple of Dr. Peppers, and...

360
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,860
<9-17,Sheldon>跑去百思买商品看看有没有便携式DVD机
<9-17,Sheldon>run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player

361
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,560
<9-17,Sheldon>还有第一季的电视剧《汉娜·蒙塔娜》
<9-17,Sheldon>and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.

362
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,710
<9-18,Rajj>让她买第二季
<9-18,Rajj>Have her get season two.

363
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,410
<9-18,Rajj>第一季的时候  剧情还在寻找风格
<9-18,Rajj>Season one, it was still finding itself.

364
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,600
<10-1,Bernadette>抱歉让你们看到我们吵架
<10-1,Bernadette>Sorry you guys had to see that.

365
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,460
<10-2,Penny>-不必道歉  -是啊
<10-2,Penny>- Oh, don't apologize. - Yeah.

366
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,980
<10-3,Leonard>这让我们更难假装这事从未发生过
<10-3,Leonard>It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.

367
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,160
<10-4,Bernadette>因为我们收入有差距
<10-4,Bernadette>Money's a sensitive subject for Howie

368
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,940
<10-4,Bernadette>所以华仔对钱这个话题很敏感
<10-4,Bernadette>because of the difference in our income.

369
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,170
<10-5,Penny>这真的会困扰他吗
<10-5,Penny>It really bothers him?

370
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,560
<10-6,Bernadette>当然啊  男人都会有这种压力
<10-6,Bernadette>Well, sure. There's still a lot of pressure

371
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,240
<10-6,Bernadette>觉得自己必须撑起这头家
<10-6,Bernadette>on guys to be providers.

372
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,890
<10-6,Bernadette>所以虽然他很为我开心
<10-6,Bernadette>So even though he's happy for me,

373
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,630
<10-6,Bernadette>但其实他心里挺难受的
<10-6,Bernadette>it's just a little tough on him.

374
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,890
<10-7,Penny>-惨了  -怎么
<10-7,Penny>- Uh-oh. - What?

375
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,450
<10-9,Penny>如果我销售做得好
<10-9,Penny>Well, if I do well in sales,

376
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,590
<10-9,Penny>我很可能也会赚得比你多很多
<10-9,Penny>I could end up making a lot more money than you.

377
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,400
<10-10,Leonard>不是问题  从小我就看我妈
<10-10,Leonard>Not a problem. I grew up with a mother

378
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,360
<10-10,Leonard>各种践踏我老爸的尊严
<10-10,Leonard>who emasculated my father financially

379
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,130
<10-10,Leonard>从金钱到各种方面  所以...
<10-10,Leonard>and in every other aspect of his life, so...

380
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,340
<10-10,Leonard>对我来说  这才是真爱的模样啊
<10-10,Leonard>...really, it's what I think love looks like.

381
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,610
<10-11,Bernadette>我失陪一下  我去看看他怎么样了
<10-11,Bernadette>I'll be right back. I'm gonna go check on him.

382
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,190
<10-12,Penny>或许我们来这边也是好事
<10-12,Penny>Maybe it's a good thing we came here.

383
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,070
<10-12,Penny>-感觉就像是反面教材  -对啊
<10-12,Penny>- It's like a lesson in what not to do. - Yeah.

384
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,580
<10-13,Leonard>我不想我们为金钱这样的蠢事而有了分歧
<10-13,Leonard>I don't want something dumb like money to come between us.

385
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,770
<10-14,Penny>不会的  我们得保证把这些都谈好了
<10-14,Penny>It won't. Let's just promise to figure this kind of stuff out

386
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,300
<10-14,Penny>我们才结婚
<10-14,Penny>before we get married.

387
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,360
<10-15,Howard (off)>你为什么这么管家婆啊
<10-15,Howard (off)>Why are you being so bossy?!

388
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,090
<10-16,Bernadette (off)>你为什么这么死小孩啊
<10-16,Bernadette (off)>Why are you being a baby?

389
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,830
<10-17,Howard (off)>我才不是死小孩  人家已经长大了
<10-17,Howard (off)>I'm not a baby! I'm a grown man,

390
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,240
<10-17,Howard (off)>我自己铺了床  我的小红花呢
<10-17,Howard (off)>and I made the bed. Now where's my star?

391
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,770
<10-18,Leonard>-我们是不是该走了  -且慢
<10-18,Leonard>- Should we go? - Hang on.

392
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,400
<10-19,Penny>我想知道他有没拿到小红花
<10-19,Penny>I want to see if he gets the star.

393
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,550
<11-1,Raj>这是要热死人啊
<11-1,Raj>Oh, this heat is brutal.

394
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,290
<11-2,Sheldon>你来自热带国度印度
<11-2,Sheldon>As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India,

395
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,020
<11-2,Sheldon>应该知道  在潮湿环境下给自己扇风
<11-2,Sheldon>you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment

396
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
<11-2,Sheldon>只会让体温升高
<11-2,Sheldon>only raises your body temperature.

397
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,010
<11-3,Rajj>现在我懂为什么以前家里佣人给我扇风时
<11-3,Rajj>That does explain why the servants used to look so hot

398
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,150
<11-3,Rajj>看起来都这么热了
<11-3,Rajj>while they were fanning me.

399
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,670
<11-3,Rajj>我们别再去想现在有多难受
<11-3,Rajj>Let's get our minds off how uncomfortable we are.

400
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,190
<11-3,Rajj>我们继续看模拟仪表读数吧
<11-3,Rajj>We could take some more simulated instrument readings.

401
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,620
<11-4,Sheldon>我现在只求
<11-4,Sheldon>My major focus at the moment

402
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,020
<11-4,Sheldon>幽闭恐惧症别占领我的心
<11-4,Sheldon>is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.

403
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,200
<11-5,Raj>-情况如何  -你觉得呢
<11-5,Raj>- How's that going? - You tell me.

404
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,580
<11-6,Sheldon>我现在感觉喘不过气
<11-6,Sheldon>I feel like I can't breathe,

405
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,990
<11-6,Sheldon>非常有冲动想把你撕成两半
<11-6,Sheldon>and I am tempted to crack you open

406
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,660
<11-6,Sheldon>再把你肺中的空气都吸光
<11-6,Sheldon>and suck the air right out of your lungs.

407
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,740
<11-7,Raj>谢尔顿  如果受不了  我们可以停止啊
<11-7,Raj>Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.

408
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,060
<11-8,Sheldon>不许停
<11-8,Sheldon>We're not stopping.

409
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,770
<11-9,Raj>那你也不用咬断我头吧
<11-9,Raj>You don't have to bite my head off.

410
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,440
<11-10,Sheldon>我道歉
<11-10,Sheldon>I apologize.

411
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,460
<11-10,Sheldon>我...
<11-10,Sheldon>I j...

412
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,410
<11-10,Sheldon>我被自己的内部斗争深深困扰
<11-10,Sheldon>I'm plagued by an internal struggle.

413
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,120
<11-11,Raj>如果你愿意在桶里释放出来
<11-11,Raj>If you would just use the bucket,

414
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,290
<11-11,Raj>你的"内部"会舒服很多
<11-11,Raj>you'd be so much more comfortable.

415
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,870
<11-12,Sheldon>我的"困扰"是情绪上的
<11-12,Sheldon>My struggle is emotional.

416
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,680
<11-13,Raj>是跟艾米有关吗
<11-13,Raj>Is it Amy?

417
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,960
<11-13,Raj>是暗物质
<11-13,Raj>It's dark matter.

418
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,670
<11-14,Sheldon>当我刚进入弦理论领域时  我是个奇才
<11-14,Sheldon>When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy.

419
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,130
<11-14,Sheldon>上升到了受人敬仰的高度
<11-14,Sheldon>I rose to a position of respect,

420
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,000
<11-14,Sheldon>我也以为职业生涯
<11-14,Sheldon>and I assumed my career would continue

421
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,520
<11-14,Sheldon>会在这条路上一直向上
<11-14,Sheldon>on that upward trajectory.

422
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,040
<11-14,Sheldon>但现在我都30多岁了
<11-14,Sheldon>Now here I am in my 30s,

423
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,900
<11-14,Sheldon>却又要从头开始
<11-14,Sheldon>I'm back at square one.

424
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,700
<11-14,Sheldon>老实说  我有些害怕
<11-14,Sheldon>And, frankly, it's frightening.

425
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,660
<11-15,Raj>谢尔顿  你知道我害怕时都想什么吗
<11-15,Raj>Sheldon, you know what I think of when I'm scared?

426
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,760
<11-16,Sheldon>旅行者
<11-16,Sheldon>Voyager.

427
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,480
<11-16,Sheldon>旅行者号太空探测器
<11-16,Sheldon>Voyager the space probe

428
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,020
<11-16,Sheldon>还是《星际迷航:航海家号》电视剧
<11-16,Sheldon>or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?

429
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,580
<11-17,Raj>太空探测器
<11-17,Raj>The space probe.

430
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,210
<11-18,Sheldon>那就好  我现在又热又累
<11-18,Sheldon>Good. Because I am too hot and tired

431
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,870
<11-18,Sheldon>没力气告诉你我有多讨厌那部电视剧
<11-18,Sheldon>to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.

432
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,580
<11-19,Raj>在我出生的那会
<11-19,Raj>By the time I was born,

433
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,130
<11-19,Raj>旅行者一号本来的任务应该就结束了
<11-19,Raj>Voyager 1's mission was supposed to be over.

434
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,830
<11-19,Raj>它已经探测完木星
<11-19,Raj>It had seen Jupiter

435
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,040
<11-19,Raj>土星以及它们所有的卫星
<11-19,Raj>and Saturn and all their moons,

436
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,990
<11-19,Raj>但它还是继续前进
<11-19,Raj>but it kept going.

437
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,320
<11-19,Raj>当我离开印度来美国时
<11-19,Raj>When I left India for America,

438
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,120
<11-19,Raj>那是我一生中最害怕的时刻
<11-19,Raj>I was never more scared in my life.

439
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,950
<11-19,Raj>前路茫茫  不知路在何方
<11-19,Raj>I had no idea what lay ahead.

440
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,000
<11-19,Raj>但每当我感到害怕时  我就会想
<11-19,Raj>Whenever I feel that way, I think about how...

441
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,130
<11-19,Raj>旅行者还在天上
<11-19,Raj>Voyager is still out there

442
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,570
<11-19,Raj>在太阳系外的某个地方
<11-19,Raj>somewhere beyond our solar system,

443
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,830
<11-19,Raj>继续朝着无人能想到它能到达的远方前进
<11-19,Raj>going further than anyone ever thought it could.

444
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,650
<12-1,Penny>别走啊  你能做到
<12-1,Penny>Don't leave! You can do this!

445
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,260
<11-20,Amy>谢尔顿  你还好吧
<11-20,Amy>Sheldon, is everything okay?

446
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,810
<11-21,Sheldon>库萨帕里来不及逃了
<11-21,Sheldon>It's too late for Koothrappali.

447
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,210
<11-21,Sheldon>咱们快跑吧
<11-21,Sheldon>Let's go!

448
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,340
<11-22,Amy>11分钟  比我预期的时间还久
<11-22,Amy>11 minutes. That's longer than I thought.

449
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,100
<11-23,Raj (off)>它们在我衣服里
<11-23,Raj (off)>They're in my shirt!

450
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,510
<11-23,Raj (off)>它们在我衣服里  爬到我衣服里了
<11-23,Raj (off)>They're in my shirt! They're in my shirt!

451
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,220
<12-1,Penny>好了  这绝对是我们可以拿这笔钱做的
<12-1,Penny>Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing

452
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,970
<12-1,Penny>最好玩的事情了
<12-1,Penny>we can do with the money.

453
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,390
<12-2,Leonard>我从来没有在一堆钱上"做"过呢
<12-2,Leonard>I've never done it on a big old pile of cash before.

454
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,360
<12-2,Leonard>"我也是  莱纳德  这也是我的第一次"
<12-2,Leonard>"Me neither, Leonard. It's my first time, too."

455
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,440
<13-1,Bernadette>抱歉我在钱的事情上让你不开心了
<13-1,Bernadette>I'm so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.

456
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,340
<13-2,Howard>-没关系啦  -不  有关系
<13-2,Howard>- It's okay. - No, it's not okay.

457
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,010
<13-3,Bernadette>我想要我们俩平起平坐
<13-3,Bernadette>I want us to be partners, equals.

458
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,580
<13-3,Bernadette>像成熟恋情中的两个大人
<13-3,Bernadette>Adults in a mature relationship.

459
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,370
<13-4,Howard>我也想这样
<13-4,Howard>I want that, too.

460
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,130
<13-5,Bernadette>那现在来聊聊你的生日派对吧
<13-5,Bernadette>Now, let's talk about your birthday party.

461
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,960
<13-6,Howard>激光枪战  激光枪战
<13-6,Howard>Ooh, laser tag, laser tag. Oh!

462
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,020
<14-1,Amy>你真的想要我转录下来吗
<14-1,Amy>Do you really need me to transcribe this?

463
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,580
<14-2,Sheldon>你不是在为我做
<14-2,Sheldon>You're not doing it for me.

464
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,640
<14-2,Sheldon>你是在为未来的人类造福
<14-2,Sheldon>You're doing it for future generations

465
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,200
<14-2,Sheldon>让他们从我的困境中学习
<14-2,Sheldon>who will benefit from my struggle.

466
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,270
<14-2,Sheldon>谢尔顿矿井模拟日志
<14-2,Sheldon>Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,

467
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,450
<14-2,Sheldon>第四条
<14-2,Sheldon>entry four:

468
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,070
<14-2,Sheldon>我的巧克力条融化了
<14-2,Sheldon>my Kit Kat has melted.

469
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,680
<14-2,Sheldon>满盘皆输
<14-2,Sheldon>All is lost.

470
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,430
<14-3,Raj>你敢说你是朋友吗
<14-3,Raj>You call yourself a friend?!

471
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,060
<14-3,Raj>我在想着帮助你
