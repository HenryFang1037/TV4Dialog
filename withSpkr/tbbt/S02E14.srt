1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,960
<1-1,Leonard>唔
<1-1,Leonard>Hmmm

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,960
<1-2,Sheldon>问题看上去无解啊
<1-2,Sheldon>The problem appears to be unsolvable.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,060
<1-3,Raj>我们可以用电脑模拟计算
<1-3,Raj>Maybe we could run some computer simulations.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,700
<1-4,Howard>变量太多  运行时间会很长
<1-4,Howard>There are too many variables. It would take forever.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,230
<1-5,Leonard>我们肯定漏掉了什么
<1-5,Leonard>We've got to be missing something.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,830
<1-5,Leonard>重来一遍
<1-5,Leonard>Let's start again.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,530
<1-5,Leonard>电影这里是七点二十上映  这里是七点四十
<1-5,Leonard>The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40,

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,130
<1-5,Leonard>这里是八点十分  这里八点四十五
<1-5,Leonard>here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,540
<1-6,Sheldon>这几个电影院得排除在外
<1-6,Sheldon>These theaters have to be eliminated.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,990
<1-7,Leonard>为什么  那里有最先进的数码影像技术
<1-7,Leonard>Why? They're state-of-the-art digital projection,

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,080
<1-7,Leonard>20道环绕立体声
<1-7,Leonard>20-channel surround sound.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,680
<1-8,Sheldon>没错  可是那里没有刨冰机
<1-8,Sheldon>Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,080
<1-8,Sheldon>还完全不理睬我那么多封投诉信 错上加错
<1-8,Sheldon>Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, i might add.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,910
<1-9,Raj>这个影城怎么样 座椅舒适极了
<1-9,Raj>What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,080
<1-10,Sheldon>它们只有Twizzlers没有Red Vines  [糖果品牌]
<1-10,Sheldon>They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,080
<1-10,Sheldon>无论多好的腰椎支撑都是无法弥补的
<1-10,Sheldon>No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,360
<1-11,Leonard>至少要一个小时吃饭
<1-11,Leonard>Well, it's gonna take at least an hour to eat,

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,210
<1-11,Leonard>在谢尔顿认证的电影院周边
<1-11,Leonard>xyzzz xyzzz and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant

18
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,080
<1-11,Leonard>根本没有谢尔顿认证的餐厅
<1-11,Leonard>proximate to a Sheldon-approved theater.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,000
<1-12,Raj>我们可以看完电影再吃晚饭
<1-12,Raj>We could eat after the movie.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,590
<1-13,Sheldon>不予通过
<1-13,Sheldon>Unacceptable.

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,590
<1-13,Sheldon>吃饭太晚会造成
<1-13,Sheldon>The delay would result

22
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,090
<1-13,Sheldon>明天早晨的大肠蠕动出现在工作时间
<1-13,Sheldon>in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occurring at work.

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,090
<1-14,Raj>等下  这里有个7-11便利店
<1-14,Raj>Hang on, hang on. There's a 7-Eleven here.

24
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,090
<1-14,Raj>我们可以偷偷把Slurpees[7-11出的冷饮]带进去  就当刨冰了
<1-14,Raj>We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees,

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,090
<1-14,Raj>藏大衣底下就行了
<1-14,Raj>in under our coats,

26
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,160
<1-14,Raj>这样我们就可以从容地先在这里  这里  或者这里吃饭了
<1-14,Raj>after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,810
<1-15,Howard>咱们刚才怎么就没想到呢
<1-15,Howard>Wow. I don't see how we missed that.

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,820
<1-16,Sheldon>不好意思  Slurpees哪里算得上刨冰呢
<1-16,Sheldon>Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,590
<1-17,Raj>所以我们刚才没想到
<1-17,Raj>That's how we missed it.

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,090
<1-18,Leonard>谢尔顿  在此紧要关头  虽说没有先例吧
<1-18,Leonard>Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis,

31
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,390
<1-18,Leonard>您能不能临时认同一下Slurpees等于刨冰
<1-18,Leonard>to create an emergency ad hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?

32
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,090
<1-19,Sheldon>莱纳德  你明白我做不到的
<1-19,Sheldon>Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,090
<1-20,Howard>好吧  我看我们只有一个选择了
<1-20,Howard>Okay, I guess we only have one option.

34
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,340
<1-21,Raj>是啊  别无它法
<1-21,Raj>Yep, I don't see any way around it.

35
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,720
<1-21,Raj>-再见  谢尔顿  -拜拜了 -好好看家
<1-21,Raj>-Bye, Sheldon. -See ya. -Stay loose.

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,960
<1-21,Raj>他们没有错  这是唯一的选择
<1-21,Raj>They're right, it was the only option.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
<2-1,Penny>快关门  快关门
<2-1,Penny>Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,530
<2-3,Penny>-咋了  -关就是了
<2-3,Penny>- Why? - Just do it!

40
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,700
<2-3,Penny>先进来再关门
<2-3,Penny>Get inside and shut the door

41
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,230
<2-4,Sheldon>你又没有说清楚
<2-4,Sheldon>Well, you didn't specify.

42
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,600
<2-5,Penny>莱纳德在么
<2-5,Penny>Is Leonard around?

43
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,500
<2-6,Sheldon>他去看电影了不带我
<2-6,Sheldon>He went to the movies without me.

44
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,230
<2-6,Sheldon>这是唯一的选择
<2-6,Sheldon>It was the only option.

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,370
<2-6,Sheldon>不好意思  我不知道这是哪种社交情况啊
<2-6,Sheldon>I'm sorry, I don't understand which social situation this is.

46
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,900
<2-6,Sheldon>您能给我点指引么
<2-6,Sheldon>Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,630
<2-7,Penny>楼管就在楼下呢
<2-7,Penny>The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs,

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,370
<2-7,Penny>我还没有缴房租
<2-7,Penny>and I haven't paid my rent.

49
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,770
<2-8,Sheldon>明白了
<2-8,Sheldon>Oh, I see.

50
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,770
<2-8,Sheldon>佩妮  让我藏匿洛城房产商的逃犯
<2-8,Sheldon>Penny, I'm not sure I'm comfortable harboring a fugitive

51
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,430
<2-8,Sheldon>我有点怕怕
<2-8,Sheldon>from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.

52
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,830
<2-9,Penny>没什么大不了的  就是欠了点房租而已
<2-9,Penny>It's no big deal. I'm just a little behind on my bills

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,700
<2-9,Penny>因为餐厅缩减了我的工作时间
<2-9,Penny>because they cut back my hours at the restaurant

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,470
<2-9,Penny>我的车又坏了
<2-9,Penny>and my car broke down.

55
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,100
<2-10,Sheldon>你还记得么  几个月以前 我告诉过你引擎检修灯在闪
<2-10,Sheldon>If you recall, I pointed out the "check engine" light to you several months ago.

56
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,230
<2-11,Penny>引擎检修灯还好着呢 现在还闪呢
<2-11,Penny>The "check engine" light is fine. It's still blinking away.

57
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,930
<2-11,Penny>是那个可恶的引擎罢工了
<2-11,Penny>It's the stupid engine that stopped working.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,900
<2-11,Penny>修车花了我将近 一千二百刀
<2-11,Penny>It cost me like $1,200 to fix it.

59
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,530
<2-12,Sheldon>依我看  你的所有问题
<2-12,Sheldon>You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems

60
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,270
<2-12,Sheldon>都可以通过多挣点钱来解决
<2-12,Sheldon>by obtaining more money.

61
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,630
<2-13,Penny>是啊  我看也是
<2-13,Penny>Yes, it occurs to me, too.

62
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,900
<2-14,Sheldon>等我一下
<2-14,Sheldon>Hang on a moment.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,800
<2-14,Sheldon>来吧  拿一些
<2-14,Sheldon>Here. Take some.

64
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,330
<2-14,Sheldon>等你有钱了再还我
<2-14,Sheldon>Pay me back when you can.

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,600
<2-15,Penny>你这儿有很多钱啊
<2-15,Penny>Wow, you got a lot of money in there.

66
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,230
<2-16,Sheldon>所以我才派蛇守卫
<2-16,Sheldon>That's why it's guarded by snakes.

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,600
<2-16,Sheldon>拿一些吧
<2-16,Sheldon>Take some.

68
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,600
<2-17,Penny>别傻了
<2-17,Penny>Don't be silly.

69
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,700
<2-18,Sheldon>我从来都不傻
<2-18,Sheldon>I'm never silly.

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,830
<2-18,Sheldon>拿着
<2-18,Sheldon>Here.

71
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,130
<2-19,Penny>我不能要
<2-19,Penny>No, I can't.

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
<2-20,Sheldon>你不是需要钱么
<2-20,Sheldon>Don't you need money?

73
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,700
<2-22,Sheldon>-是啊  可是  -我用不到这些钱
<2-22,Sheldon>- Well, yeah, but... - This is money I'm not using.

74
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,030
<2-23,Penny>你要用钱怎么办
<2-23,Penny>But what if you need it?

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,930
<2-24,Sheldon>我的日常开支占我税后收入的46.9%
<2-24,Sheldon>My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,870
<2-24,Sheldon>其余的部分分别藏在银行帐户里
<2-24,Sheldon>The rest is divvied up between a small savings account,

77
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,370
<2-24,Sheldon>这个隐蔽的花生糖的罐子里
<2-24,Sheldon>this deceptive container of peanut brittle

78
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,800
<2-24,Sheldon>还有超级英雄人偶的空心屁屁里
<2-24,Sheldon>and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure

79
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,270
<2-24,Sheldon>他不得已才隐姓埋名得以终日
<2-24,Sheldon>who shall remain nameless for his own protection.

80
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,500
<2-24,Sheldon>或者是女她
<2-24,Sheldon>Or her own protection.

81
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,800
<2-24,Sheldon>拿一些吧
<2-24,Sheldon>Take some.

82
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,730
<2-25,Penny>真的么  你肯定么
<2-25,Penny>Really? I mean, are you sure?

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,070
<2-26,Sheldon>我最近没有什么大的开销
<2-26,Sheldon>I see no large upcoming expenditures

84
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,700
<2-26,Sheldon>除非他们发明了新的科技
<2-26,Sheldon>unless they develop an affordable technology

85
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,900
<2-26,Sheldon>能将我的骨骼铸成金刚狼一样的合金
<2-26,Sheldon>to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.

86
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,700
<2-27,Penny>他们在研究这个么
<2-27,Penny>Are they working on that?

87
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,100
<2-28,Sheldon>我衷心希望
<2-28,Sheldon>I sincerely hope so.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,270
<2-28,Sheldon>好吧
<2-28,Sheldon>Okay.

89
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,330
<2-29,Penny>谢谢你
<2-29,Penny>Well, thank you.

90
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,730
<2-29,Penny>不行  谢尔顿  亲爱的
<2-29,Penny>Oh, no, I can't. Sheldon honey,

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,370
<2-29,Penny>我不希望你我之间 变得怪怪的
<2-29,Penny>I don't want things to be weird between us.

92
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,070
<2-30,Sheldon>如果我每天早晨上班之前 都要和你问早安
<2-30,Sheldon>Won't it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work

93
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,800
<2-30,Sheldon>可是你却住在冰箱盒子里 用雨水洗头  不是也很奇怪么
<2-30,Sheldon>and you're living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?

94
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,200
<2-31,Penny>等我有钱了就还你
<2-31,Penny>I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

95
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,630
<2-32,Sheldon>那是肯定的
<2-32,Sheldon>Of course you will.

96
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,430
<2-32,Sheldon>没钱你也还不了
<2-32,Sheldon>It's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can.

97
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,800
<2-32,Sheldon>我假设你遵循前因后果
<2-32,Sheldon>Assuming you subscribe

98
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,030
<2-32,Sheldon>与时间的线性关系
<2-32,Sheldon>to a linear understanding of time and causality.

99
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,900
<2-33,Penny>我已经开始后悔了
<2-33,Penny>I'm regretting this already.

100
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,030
<3-1,Sheldon>我反复考虑过了
<3-1,Sheldon>You know, I've given the matter some thought,

101
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,700
<3-1,Sheldon>我宁可自己是一只家养宠物
<3-1,Sheldon>and I think I'd be willing to be a house pet

102
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,330
<3-1,Sheldon>也不愿意成为高智能的外星人
<3-1,Sheldon>to a race of super-intelligent aliens.

103
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,230
<3-2,Leonard>有意思
<3-2,Leonard>Interesting.

104
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,370
<3-3,Sheldon>问我为什么
<3-3,Sheldon>Ask me why.

105
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,070
<3-4,Leonard>一定要问么
<3-4,Leonard>Do I have to?

106
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,330
<3-5,Sheldon>当然
<3-5,Sheldon>Of course.

107
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,430
<3-5,Sheldon>这样对话才能进展下去
<3-5,Sheldon>That's how you move a conversation forward.

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,200
<3-6,Leonard>为什么呢
<3-6,Leonard>Why?

109
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,400
<3-7,Sheldon>这样学习的机会 会比较充裕
<3-7,Sheldon>The learning opportunities would be abundant.

110
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,700
<3-7,Sheldon>并且  我喜欢被人抓抓肚皮
<3-7,Sheldon>Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.

111
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,130
<3-8,Leonard>佩妮  上班还好么
<3-8,Leonard>Hey, Penny. How was work?

112
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,530
<3-8,Leonard>妙极了
<3-8,Leonard>Great.

113
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,370
<3-9,Penny>我希望我能
<3-9,Penny>I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory

114
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,400
<3-9,Penny>做一辈子奶酪店的服务员
<3-9,Penny>for my whole life.

115
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,930
<3-10,Sheldon>这是讽刺么?
<3-10,Sheldon>Was that sarcasm?

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,730
<3-11,Penny>不
<3-11,Penny>No.

117
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,100
<3-10,Sheldon>那这句呢?
<3-10,Sheldon>Was that sarcasm?

118
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,230
<3-13,Penny>是
<3-13,Penny>Yes.

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,500
<3-15,Leonard>-那这句  -闭嘴吧
<3-15,Leonard>Was that sar-- Stop it!

120
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,800
<3-16,Sheldon>佩妮  这有个你的包裹
<3-16,Sheldon>Penny, you appear to have a package here.

121
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,870
<3-17,Penny>谢谢
<3-17,Penny>Oh, thanks.

122
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,430
<3-17,Penny>肯定是我订的贝雷帽
<3-17,Penny>This must be the beret I ordered.

123
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,770
<3-17,Penny>都是几个月前的事了  是以前订的
<3-17,Penny>A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.

124
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,030
<3-18,Sheldon>你知道么  贝雷帽
<3-18,Sheldon>Did you know the beret is an example

125
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,470
<3-18,Sheldon>是女性时尚参考男性军服
<3-18,Sheldon>of a piece of women's fashion

126
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,530
<3-18,Sheldon>很好的例子
<3-18,Sheldon>adapted from male military uniforms?

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,930
<3-18,Sheldon>另一个迷人的例子是肩饰
<3-18,Sheldon>Another fascinating example is the epaulet.

128
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,230
<3-19,Leonard>他没说谎
<3-19,Leonard>He's not lying.

129
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,170
<3-19,Leonard>他真的很喜欢肩饰
<3-19,Leonard>He does find that fascinating.

130
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,270
<3-20,Penny>无所谓了
<3-20,Penny>Okay, whatever.

131
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,470
<3-20,Penny>我并没有为了一个贝雷帽
<3-20,Penny>It's not like I'm running up and down the streets

132
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,500
<3-20,Penny>在街上逛来逛去
<3-20,Penny>just buying myself berets.

133
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,970
<3-20,Penny>我订了一个  一个月前
<3-20,Penny>I bought one, like, a month ago,

134
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,270
<3-20,Penny>那是之前订的
<3-20,Penny>and it was back-ordered.

135
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,530
<3-21,Sheldon>-现在终于寄到了  有问题么？  -没有
<3-21,Sheldon>Look, it finally arrived, all right? All right.

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,630
<3-22,Penny>我的天  你能不能别那么多事
<3-22,Penny>Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?!

137
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,970
<3-23,Leonard>真奇怪
<3-23,Leonard>Weird.

138
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,370
<3-24,Sheldon>太好了  原来这不是正常的对话模式
<3-24,Sheldon>Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction.

139
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,500
<3-24,Sheldon>我本来还不确定
<3-24,Sheldon>I wasn't sure.

140
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,470
<3-25,Leonard>你们之前吵过架?
<3-25,Leonard>Did you guys have an argument?

141
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,670
<3-26,Sheldon>没啊
<3-26,Sheldon>No.

142
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,300
<3-27,Leonard>你肯定干什么事惹着她来着
<3-27,Leonard>Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.

143
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,100
<3-28,Sheldon>我没概念了
<3-28,Sheldon>I'm at a loss.

144
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,430
<3-28,Sheldon>高兴地话  你可以去查查我的社交日志
<3-28,Sheldon>If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions

145
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,870
<3-28,Sheldon>看看有没有我没注意到的失误
<3-28,Sheldon>and see if there's a blunder I overlooked.

146
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,770
<3-28,Sheldon>你的这份
<3-28,Sheldon>Here you go.

147
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,030
<4-1,Leonard>对  你还多欠我两块
<4-1,Leonard>Oh, you owe me another two dollars.

148
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,500
<4-1,Leonard>木须肉涨价了
<4-1,Leonard>The price of moo shu pork went up.

149
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,530
<4-2,Howard>当个"可恶的犹太人"真是越来越难了
<4-2,Howard>It's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.

150
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,100
<4-3,Leonard>佩妮  你的龙虾酱炒虾
<4-3,Leonard>Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.

00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,400
<4-4,Penny>谢谢  莱纳德  我该给多少
<4-4,Penny>Thank you, Leonard. What's my share?

152
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,530
<4-5,Leonard>没事  我请你
<4-5,Leonard>Don't worry about it. It's my treat.

153
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,170
<4-6,Penny>不  多少钱?
<4-6,Penny>No, really, how much?

154
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,600
<4-7,Leonard>差不多10块11块吧
<4-7,Leonard>It's... whatever. $10, $11.

155
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,500
<4-8,Penny>到底是10块还是11块?
<4-8,Penny>Well, which is it, $10 or $11?

156
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,670
<4-9,Leonard>14块5  真没多少
<4-9,Leonard>$14.50. But it's no biggie.

157
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,230
<4-9,Leonard>下次你请就好了
<4-9,Leonard>You'll get the next one.

158
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,270
<4-10,Penny>又怎么了
<4-10,Penny>What?

159
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,530
<4-11,Howard>他在猜如果
<4-11,Howard>He was just wondering if he wore

160
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,200
<4-11,Howard>他穿紧身上衣和牛仔裤的话
<4-11,Howard>skintight jeans and a tank top

161
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,400
<4-11,Howard>是不是也能免费吃到鲜虾捞面了
<4-11,Howard>if he'd get his shrimp lo mein for free.

162
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,770
<4-13,Howard>你什么意思
<4-13,Howard>What are you saying?

163
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,200
<4-12,Penny>我用我的身体来让别人请客?
<4-12,Penny>That I'm using my body to get dinner?

164
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,770
<4-12,Penny>我是骗中餐小姐
<4-12,Penny>That I'm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?

165
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,200
<4-13,Howard>对  拉杰  你什么意思
<4-13,Howard>Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?

166
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,400
<4-14,Penny>告诉你吧  哥们
<4-14,Penny>'Cause let me tell you something, buddy.

167
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,970
<4-14,Penny>我靠自己的钱过活  明白?
<4-14,Penny>I pay my own way in this world, okay?

168
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,230
<4-14,Penny>我不需要靠别人
<4-14,Penny>I don't rely on anybody!

169
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,530
<4-14,Penny>这又怎么了?
<4-14,Penny>What was that about?

170
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,570
<4-15,Howard>当他感受到压力的时候就尿急
<4-15,Howard>He has a nervous bladder when he's stressed out.

171
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,300
<4-15,Howard>像小狗似的
<4-15,Howard>Kind of like a puppy.

172
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,570
<4-16,Penny>莱纳德  拿着  10, 11, 12... 14块
<4-16,Penny>Here, Leonard-- $10, $11, $12... $14.

173
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,770
<4-17,Leonard>是14块5  算了
<4-17,Leonard>It was $14.50, but it's okay.

174
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,430
<4-18,Sheldon>太好了  饭(双关:正餐)来了
<4-18,Sheldon>Oh, good. Dinner's here.

175
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,030
<4-19,Penny>没错  正餐来了
<4-19,Penny>Yes, dinner's here, and I'm having some.

176
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,370
<4-19,Penny>而我只能吃外卖
<4-19,Penny>I'm having takeout food.

177
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,070
<4-21,Penny>-好吧  -说得太他妈对了
<4-21,Penny>Okay. You're damn right it's okay.

178
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,930
<4-21,Penny>我在饭店吃了四天的残羹剩饭
<4-21,Penny>I've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days,

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,470
<4-21,Penny>今天我想换个花样  去告我啊
<4-21,Penny>and I wanted something different. So sue me.

180
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,170
<4-22,Sheldon>请原谅  佩妮
<4-22,Sheldon>Forgive me, Penny, but that would be

181
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,230
<4-22,Sheldon>那是诉讼挑唆的意思
<4-22,Sheldon>the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.

182
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,700
<4-23,Penny>谢尔顿  我有了钱马上还你
<4-23,Penny>Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can.

183
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,300
<4-23,Penny>只是要宽限我几天
<4-23,Penny>You just have to give me more time.

184
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,730
<4-24,Leonard>等等  你借她钱来着
<4-24,Leonard>Oh, wait, you lent her money?

185
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,770
<4-25,Penny>她需要钱
<4-25,Penny>She needed money.

186
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,870
<4-25,Penny>你看上去很有压力
<4-25,Penny>You seem under pressure.

187
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,330
<4-25,Penny>我借给你的够么
<4-25,Penny>Did I not lend you a sufficient amount?

188
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,830
<4-25,Penny>你可以再来点
<4-25,Penny>Because I can give you more.

189
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,200
<4-26,Penny>你很喜欢这样不是么
<4-26,Penny>Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn't you?

190
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,770
<4-26,Penny>打开你的小蛇把守的罐子
<4-26,Penny>Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can

191
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,170
<4-26,Penny>然后把钱施舍给那些付不了帐单的姑娘
<4-26,Penny>and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills.

192
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,270
<4-27,Leonard>你去哪
<4-27,Leonard>Where are you going?

193
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,530
<4-28,Penny>回家 在那我不用像个犯人似的被审问
<4-28,Penny>Going home, where I won't be interrogated like a criminal.

194
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,100
<4-28,Penny>我忘了幸运饼干了
<4-28,Penny>I forgot my fortune cookie.

195
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,700
<4-29,Sheldon>以防你们谁有贼心
<4-29,Sheldon>In case either of you have larceny in your heart,

196
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,000
<4-29,Sheldon>提醒一下  我已经把钱从小蛇罐子挪走了
<4-29,Sheldon>you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can.

197
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,430
<4-30,Leonard>但如果真缺钱的话
<4-30,Leonard>But if you're ever short,

198
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,030
<4-30,Leonard>在绿灯侠的屁股里总能找到50块
<4-30,Leonard>there's always a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass.

199
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,500
<5-3,Leonard>温馨的烛光哈
<5-3,Leonard>A little mood lighting, huh?

200
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
<5-4,Penny>因为没付帐单
<5-4,Penny>When I didn't pay my bill,

201
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,230
<5-4,Penny>水电局认为
<5-4,Penny>the Department of Water and Power thought

202
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,900
<5-4,Penny>我会享受这样的气氛
<5-4,Penny>I would enjoy the ambience.

203
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,500
<5-5,Leonard>这样看来他们还挺周到的
<5-5,Leonard>Yeah, they're very considerate that way.

204
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,630
<5-6,Penny>我用谢尔顿的钱付了房租
<5-6,Penny>I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent.

205
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,830
<5-6,Penny>然后只剩14块
<5-6,Penny>Then I had like $14 left over.

206
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,270
<5-7,Leonard>14块?
<5-7,Leonard>$14, huh?

207
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,770
<5-8,Penny>放回你的口袋里
<5-8,Penny>Put it back in your pocket,

208
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,130
<5-8,Penny>要不然我会找个其他的地方搁
<5-8,Penny>or I'll find some other place to put it.

209
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,770
<5-9,Leonard>已经放回去了
<5-9,Leonard>Back in the pocket it goes.

210
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,110
<5-9,Leonard>要知道  谢尔顿真不在乎 什么时候你还他钱
<5-9,Leonard>Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back.

211
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,230
<5-9,Leonard>事实上 正是像这种为数不多的特点
<5-9,Leonard>It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to,

212
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,500
<5-9,Leonard>才让你对他没有杀意
<5-9,Leonard>you know, kill him.

213
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,070
<5-10,Penny>但这并不是最大的问题所在
<5-10,Penny>Yeah, well, that's not really my big problem.

214
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,900
<5-11,Leonard>你不就欠了点费吗
<5-11,Leonard>So you're a little behind on your bills.

215
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,500
<5-11,Leonard>谁不欠费啊
<5-11,Leonard>Everybody gets behind on their bills.

216
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,830
<5-12,Penny>我知道  但这和我的预期差别太大了
<5-12,Penny>Yeah, I know, it's just... this wasn't the plan.

217
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,830
<5-12,Penny>我没打算变成现在这样的
<5-12,Penny>It wasn't supposed to go this way.

218
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,230
<5-13,Leonard>那你原来打算怎么样
<5-13,Leonard>Well, what was the plan?

219
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,730
<5-14,Penny>当六个月服务员然后成为电影明星
<5-14,Penny>Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.

220
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,030
<5-15,Leonard>有没有B计划?
<5-15,Leonard>Was there a plan B?

221
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
<5-16,Penny>电视明星
<5-16,Penny>TV star.

222
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,300
<5-17,Leonard>可能没你想的那么糟
<5-17,Leonard>It's probably not as bad as you think.

223
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,330
<5-17,Leonard>让我们看看
<5-17,Leonard>Let's take a look.

224
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,270
<5-17,Leonard>说不定能找到些能缩减的开支
<5-17,Leonard>Maybe we can find some corners to cut.

225
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,100
<5-17,Leonard>这有一些
<5-17,Leonard>Oh, here's something.

226
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,530
<5-17,Leonard>如果你家没有电
<5-17,Leonard>If you don't have electricity,

227
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,630
<5-17,Leonard>那你可能也不需要有线网络了
<5-17,Leonard>then you probably don't need cable.

228
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,470
<5-17,Leonard>只是说说而已
<5-17,Leonard>Just a suggestion.

229
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,030
<5-17,Leonard>价值170美金的表演课程?
<5-17,Leonard>$170 dollars for acting classes?

230
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,470
<5-18,Penny>不  我不能放弃我的表演课
<5-18,Penny>Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes.

231
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,600
<5-18,Penny>我是个专业女演员
<5-18,Penny>I'm a professional actress.

232
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,400
<5-19,Leonard>你有能赚钱的表演工作?
<5-19,Leonard>You've had an acting job where you got paid?

233
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,730
<5-20,Penny>这不是评判"专业"的标准
<5-20,Penny>That is not the definition of professional.

234
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,830
<5-21,Leonard>实际上这就是...我们还是继续看吧
<5-21,Leonard>Actually, it kind of... Let's keep looking.

235
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,600
<5-21,Leonard>哪儿来的洛杉矶高等法院的1800美金罚款?
<5-21,Leonard>Whoa, what's $1,800 to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?

236
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,570
<5-22,Penny>没什么
<5-22,Penny>Oh, that's nothing.

237
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,970
<5-22,Penny>没什么?
<5-22,Penny>Nothing?

238
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,700
<5-23,Leonard>貌似你以4000英里的时速
<5-23,Leonard>It sounds like you got caught speeding

239
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,070
<5-23,Leonard>超速驾驶被逮着了
<5-23,Leonard>going 4,000 miles an hour.

240
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,670
<5-24,Penny>还记得科特吗
<5-24,Penny>Well, remember Kurt?

241
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,770
<5-25,Leonard>你那个前男友?
<5-25,Leonard>Your ex-boyfriend?

242
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,270
<5-25,Leonard>嗯
<5-25,Leonard>Yeah.

243
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,400
<5-26,Penny>他在警车上小便被抓了
<5-26,Penny>He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.

244
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,630
<5-28,Penny>-什么?  -他喝醉了
<5-28,Penny>-What? -He was drunk.

245
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,470
<5-29,Leonard>但愿如此
<5-29,Leonard>I would hope so.

246
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,330
<5-30,Penny>话说他有很多罚款单
<5-30,Penny>Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets

247
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,370
<5-30,Penny>还有一堆告票
<5-30,Penny>and a bench warrant,

248
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,930
<5-30,Penny>所以  我帮他付了罚款
<5-30,Penny>so I, you know, I paid his fines.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,170
<5-31,Leonard>他把钱还给你了吗
<5-31,Leonard>Did he pay you back?

250
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,400
<5-32,Penny>没有  不过他会还的
<5-32,Penny>No, but he will.

251
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,200
<5-33,Leonard>这还建立在他是个天生没信用 经常喝醉
<5-33,Leonard>And that's based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people

252
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,800
<5-33,Leonard>还在警车里小便的人渣的基础之上的?
<5-33,Leonard>who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?

253
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,270
<5-34,Penny>莱纳德  我不会打电话给科特向他讨债的
<5-34,Penny>Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.

254
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,500
<5-34,Penny>那...
<5-34,Penny>Well...

255
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,170
<5-35,Leonard>你准备怎么做?
<5-35,Leonard>what are you gonna do?

256
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,370
<5-35,Leonard>我也不知道
<5-35,Leonard>I don't know,

257
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,500
<5-36,Penny>不过我可能得去找个便宜点的地方住了
<5-36,Penny>but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.

258
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,270
<5-37,Leonard>不...
<5-37,Leonard>Oh, no...

259
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,970
<5-37,Leonard>你不会想这样做的
<5-37,Leonard>Oh, you don't want to do that.

260
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,170
<5-38,Penny>为什么不呢?
<5-38,Penny>Why not?

261
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,930
<5-39,Leonard>搬家要花很多钱的
<5-39,Leonard>Moving is a big deal.

262
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,400
<5-39,Leonard>你得去超市买那些置物箱
<5-39,Leonard>You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes,

263
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,970
<5-39,Leonard>那些箱子不干净的话  你的书就会有股甜瓜味
<5-39,Leonard>and if they're not clean, then your books smell like melons,

264
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,130
<5-39,Leonard>就像...
<5-39,Leonard>and it's just, like...

265
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,270
<5-39,Leonard>你干吗不找个室友搬进来住呢
<5-39,Leonard>Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here

266
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,500
<5-40,Penny>你认识什么适合的人不
<5-40,Penny>do you know anybody

267

<5-41,Leonard>决不会介意搬来跟你住的
<5-41,Leonard>wouldn't mind moving in with you.

269
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,730
<5-42,Penny>莱纳德  亲爱的  如果我们开始一起住的话
<5-42,Penny>Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together,

270
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,870
<5-42,Penny>我会一直都缠着你的
<5-42,Penny>I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you.

271
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,300
<5-43,Leonard>真的吗
<5-43,Leonard>Really?

272
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,730
<5-44,Penny>你以为我表演课是白上的吗
<5-44,Penny>And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.

273
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,330
<6-1,Howard>那些木须肉在我的十二指肠里烧穿了个洞
<6-1,Howard>This moo shu pork's burning a hole through my duodenum.

274
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,900
<6-2,Raj>利未记(圣经)第十一章第三节里说
<6-2,Raj>Leviticus 11:3:

275
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,230

<6-11,Leonard>你们还记得 佩妮的前男友科特吗
<6-11,Leonard>Do you guys remember penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

<6-11,Leonard>谁想参加
<6-11,Leonard>Who's with me?

290
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,530

<6-13,Leonard>你们真的忍心让我一个人去吗
<6-13,Leonard>Really? You're just gonna let me go by myself?

292
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,770
<6-14,Raj>太棒了  我得到了一把剑
<6-14,Raj>Oh, cool, I got a sword.

293
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,700
<6-15,Leonard>我可能需要点帮助
<6-15,Leonard>I could use some help.

294
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,600
<6-16,Raj>给你
<6-16,Raj>Here.

295
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,630
<6-17,Leonard>真难以置信
<6-17,Leonard>xyzzz xyzzz You guys are unbelievable.

296
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,630
<6-17,Leonard>你们玩游戏就是为了模拟冒险场景
<6-17,Leonard>You play a game to simulate adventure,

297
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,170
<6-17,Leonard>但真的可以出去冒险的时候 你们就都窝囊了
<6-17,Leonard>but when there's real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.

298
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,370
<6-18,Sheldon>莱纳德  还记得我们上次去找这个男人
<6-18,Sheldon>Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman,

299
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,130
<6-18,Sheldon>结果回来的时候裤子都没了吗
<6-18,Sheldon>we returned home without pants?

300
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,070
<6-19,Leonard>我记得
<6-19,Leonard>I do.

301
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,070
<6-20,Sheldon>你确定么  但你提议表明你已经忘记了
<6-20,Sheldon>Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don't.

302
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,570
<6-21,Leonard>我不怕他
<6-21,Leonard>I'm not afraid of him.

303
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,770
<6-22,Sheldon>好吧  莱纳德刚才清楚地表明了他的问题
<6-22,Sheldon>All right. Leonard fairly calls the question:

304
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,400
<6-22,Sheldon>谁愿意放弃我们的游戏而去面对
<6-22,Sheldon>Who is in favor of abandoning our game and confronting

305
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,270
<6-22,Sheldon>佩妮那个类固醇激素旺盛的前男友
<6-22,Sheldon>Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend

306
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,100
<6-22,Sheldon>并以一种自杀的方式去向他要钱
<6-22,Sheldon>in a suicidal mission to extract money from him?

307
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,170
<6-22,Sheldon>代我们向科特问好
<6-22,Sheldon>Say hi to Kurt for us.

308
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,970
<6-23,Leonard>你们说  佛罗多离开夏尔 把魔戒带去莫都的时候
<6-23,Leonard>Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor,

309
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,970
<6-23,Leonard>山姆怀斯  皮平和梅利有没有陪他一起去?
<6-23,Leonard>didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?

310
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,470
<6-24,Sheldon>-他们去了  -所以
<6-24,Sheldon>-They did. -Well?

311
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,130
<6-26,Sheldon>他们那时很艰难  莱纳德
<6-26,Sheldon>They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.

312
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,470
<6-27,Raj>再说  没有人剥了他们的裤子
<6-27,Raj>Plus, no one stole their pants.

313
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,570
<6-28,Leonard>好吧  好好享受你们的游戏
<6-28,Leonard>Fine. Enjoy your little game.

314
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,830
<6-28,Leonard>我自己去完成这个冒险
<6-28,Leonard>I'll make this quest on my own.

315
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,730
<6-29,Howard>莱纳德  等等
<6-29,Howard>Leonard, wait.

316
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,770
<6-29,Howard>带件外套去
<6-29,Howard>Take a jacket.

317
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,470
<6-29,Howard>外面有点凉飕飕的
<6-29,Howard>It's shpritzing a little.

318
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,170
<6-30,Leonard>你们都是损友
<6-30,Leonard>You guys suck.

319
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,270
<6-30,Leonard>去吧  求你们了  他太健壮了
<6-30,Leonard>Come on, please? He's so big.

320
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,730
<7-1,Leonard>大家都清楚我们的计划了
<7-1,Leonard>Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?

321
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,830
<7-2,Howard>嗯  库萨帕里准备要尿裤子了
<7-2,Howard>Yes. Koothrappali's going to wet himself,

322
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,970
<7-2,Howard>我准备要吐了  谢尔顿准备逃跑了
<7-2,Howard>I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's gonna run away,

323
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,100
<7-2,Howard>你准备要死了
<7-2,Howard>and you're going to die.

324
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,630
<7-2,Howard>我们对一下表吧
<7-2,Howard>Shall we synchronize our watches?

325
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,300
<7-3,Leonard>伙计们  我们有四个人 他只有一个人
<7-3,Leonard>Guys, there are four of us and one of him.

326
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,370
<7-4,Sheldon>也就是说他将有更多的战利品
<7-4,Sheldon>Which means his triumph will be even larger.

327
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,000
<7-4,Sheldon>吟游诗人会为他写歌
<7-4,Sheldon>Minstrels will write songs about him.

328
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,100
<7-5,Leonard>这样吧
<7-5,Leonard>Okay, how about this?

329
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,400
<7-5,Leonard>我来跟他谈
<7-5,Leonard>I'll do the talking.

330
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,270
<7-5,Leonard>你们就站在我后面假装很凶悍
<7-5,Leonard>You just stand behind me and try to look formidable.

331
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,230
<7-6,Raj>出门前应该上个厕所的
<7-6,Raj>I should've peed before we left.

332
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,200
<7-7,Kurt>什么事
<7-7,Kurt>Yeah?

333
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,730
<7-8,Leonard>你好  科特
<7-8,Leonard>Hi, Kurt.

334
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,070
<7-9,Kurt>你是莱尼吗
<7-9,Kurt>Lenny, right?

335
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,500
<7-10,Leonard>其实我不喜欢被叫莱尼  不过没关系
<7-10,Leonard>I don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay.

336
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,830
<7-10,Leonard>你还记得
<7-10,Leonard>Um, you remember

337
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,730
<7-10,Leonard>谢尔顿  霍华德 和拉杰吗
<7-10,Leonard>Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

338
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,030
<7-11,Kurt>不记得  你想干嘛
<7-11,Kurt>No. What do you want?

339
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,400
<7-12,Sheldon>他不记得我了
<7-12,Sheldon>He don't remember me?

340
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,770
<7-12,Sheldon>他怎能不记得我了
<7-12,Sheldon>How could he not remember me?

341
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,670
<7-13,Leonard>谢尔顿  别这样
<7-13,Leonard>Sheldon, not now.

342
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,070
<7-14,Sheldon>我可记得他
<7-14,Sheldon>I remember him.

343
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,800
<7-15,Leonard>事情是这样的  佩妮的经济出现了状况
<7-15,Leonard>Okay, here it is. Penny's in kind of a financial jam,

344
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,430
<7-15,Leonard>而你欠她的钱  对于缓解危机
<7-15,Leonard>and the money that you owe her would go a long way

345
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,600
<7-15,Leonard>相当有帮助
<7-15,Leonard>to solving her problems.

346
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,430
<7-16,Kurt>于是她叫你来拿钱
<7-16,Kurt>And she sent you to get it from me?

347
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,230
<7-17,Leonard>当然不  她是不好意思来取
<7-17,Leonard>No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money.

348
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,100
<7-17,Leonard>此外  我认为欠债还钱  天经地义
<7-17,Leonard>I, on the other hand, feel you should honor your debt.

349
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,800
<7-18,Kurt>你认为
<7-18,Kurt>You do?

350
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,730
<7-19,Leonard>说"认为"  语气已经较强烈了
<7-19,Leonard>"Feel" is a kind of a... it's a strong word.

351
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,700
<7-19,Leonard>我希望对你来说  这词儿还算是礼貌用语
<7-19,Leonard>Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.

352
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,370
<7-20,Kurt>我想什么时候还就什么时候还
<7-20,Kurt>She'll get it when she gets it.

353
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,030
<7-21,Howard>你看  问题解决了
<7-21,Howard>Well, there you go. Problem solved.

354
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,630
<7-22,Raj>目的达到了
<7-22,Raj>A successful quest.

355
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,730
<7-22,Raj>我们快去找个有干净厕所的加油站吧
<7-22,Raj>Now let's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.

356
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,330
<7-23,Leonard>不  问题还没解决
<7-23,Leonard>No, the problem isn't solved.

357
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
<7-23,Leonard>他根本没理会我们
<7-23,Leonard>He just blew us off.

358
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,670
<7-24,Sheldon>我明白了
<7-24,Sheldon>I've got it.

359
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,000
<7-24,Sheldon>因为上次见面时  我正穿着万圣节服饰
<7-24,Sheldon>He didn't remember me because the last time we met,

360
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,500
<7-24,Sheldon>所以他没记得我
<7-24,Sheldon>I was in a Halloween costume.

361
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,600
<7-25,Howard>拜托  莱纳德  我们走吧
<7-25,Howard>Come on, Leonard, let's go.

362
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,030
<7-26,Leonard>不  你们想走就走吧
<7-26,Leonard>No. You can leave if you want to.

363
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,170
<7-26,Leonard>我必须有始有终
<7-26,Leonard>I'm gonna see this through.

364
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,070
<7-27,Howard>那好吧
<7-27,Howard>Okay.

365
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,330
<7-28,Leonard>其实本来就不该带你们来
<7-28,Leonard>I guess, technically, that was my fault.

366
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,330
<7-28,Leonard>拿不到佩妮的钱  我是不会走的
<7-28,Leonard>I'm not leaving here without Penny's money.

367
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,170
<7-29,Kurt>你的后援团去哪了
<7-29,Kurt>What happened to your backup?

368
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,130
<7-30,Leonard>我可不需要后援团
<7-30,Leonard>I don't need backup.

369
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,430
<7-30,Leonard>因为正义站在我这边
<7-30,Leonard>I have right on my side.

370
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,000
<7-30,Leonard>而且我长裤里还多穿了条平脚裤
<7-30,Leonard>And I'm wearing cargo shorts under my pants.

371
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,370
<8-1,Sheldon>恭喜你
<8-1,Sheldon>congratulations.

372
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,570
<8-1,Sheldon>你没有拿到现金
<8-1,Sheldon>You may not have succeeded in getting cash,

373
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,900
<8-1,Sheldon>却打到了正式的欠条
<8-1,Sheldon>but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

374
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,700
<8-2,Howard>或许我们应该把你头拿去公证一下
<8-2,Howard>Maybe we should have your head notarized.

375
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,810
<8-3,Raj>不介意的话  我还是想尿尿
<8-3,Raj>If anybody cares, I still have to pee

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,100
<9-5,Leonard>最近流行这款
<9-5,Leonard>It's kind of a fashionable look these days.

380
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,230
<9-6,Penny>看起来像捕鱼的
<9-6,Penny>Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.

381
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,730
<9-7,Sheldon>佩妮  你来啦
<9-7,Sheldon>Hello, Penny.

<9-8,Penny>Thank you very much. It helped a lot.

384
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,900
<9-9,Sheldon>讽刺吗
<9-9,Sheldon>Sarcasm?

385
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,230
<9-10,Penny>不
<9-10,Penny>No.

386
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,870
<9-11,Sheldon>该死  我还是没有摸透其中奥秘
<9-11,Sheldon>Darn. I can't seem to get the hang of that.

387
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,400
<9-12,Leonard>虽然这与我无关
<9-12,Leonard>Hey, I know it's none of my business,

388
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,230
<9-12,Leonard>但这些钱你从哪来的
<9-12,Leonard>but where did the money come from?

389
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,700
<9-13,Penny>就如你说的  我省下一部分开支
<9-13,Penny>Well, I cut back my expenses like you said

390
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,870
<9-13,Penny>在餐厅里多加几小时的班
<9-13,Penny>and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant,

391
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,570
<9-13,Penny>但最主要的是  突然间
<9-13,Penny>but the biggest thing was, out of the blue,

392

<9-13,Penny>科特回来了
<9-13,Penny>Kurt shows up

393
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,470
<9-13,Penny>还把他欠我的钱还给了我
<9-13,Penny>and gives me the money he owes me..

394
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,330
<9-14,Leonard>真的吗  他有说为什么吗
<9-14,Leonard>Really? Did he say why?

395
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,100
<9-15,Penny>是的  他说他觉得很惭愧
<9-15,Penny>Yes, he said he was feeling guilty

396
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,600
<9-15,Penny>还钱本是天经地义
<9-15,Penny>and wanted to do what was right.

397
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,470
<9-15,Penny>就这样
<9-15,Penny>That's it?

398
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,700
<9-16,Leonard>他没有对其突然良心发现 给出任何理由吗
<9-16,Leonard>Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?

399
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,400
<9-17,Penny>没有  我认为他真的改变了
<9-17,Penny>Nope. I just think he's really changed.

<9-17,Penny>我们明晚要共进晚餐

<9-19,Sheldon>He fights for right and justice simply

407
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,730
<9-19,Sheldon>完全是天性使然

<9-20,Leonard>and I have indelible ink on my forehead!

410
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,430

<9-21,Sheldon>That's your badge of honor

411
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,370
<9-21,Sheldon>你也可以称其为  战斗的印记
<9-21,Sheldon>your warrior's wound, if you will.

412
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,070
