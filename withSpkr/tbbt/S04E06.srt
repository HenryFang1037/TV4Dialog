1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,200
<1-2,Leonard>有问题吗
<1-2,Leonard>Problem?

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,610
<1-3,Howard>这是我吃过最难吃的脆皮水果派
<1-3,Howard>This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,780
<1-3,Howard>味道就跟出自一个初级的补鞋匠之手一样
<1-3,Howard>It tastes like it's made of actual ground-up shoemaker.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,350
<1-4,Sheldon>真好笑  "cobbler"一词两意都点到了
<1-4,Sheldon>Amusing. A play on the two meanings of "cobbler."

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,590
<1-5,Raj>伙计们  猜猜我在洛杉矶机场发现谁了
<1-5,Raj>Hey   guys. Guess who I found at LAX?

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,920
<1-5,Raj>我的妹妹普丽娅
<1-5,Raj>My baby sister Priya.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,090
<1-6,Sheldon>抱歉  我反对
<1-6,Sheldon>Excuse me   I object.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,290
<1-6,Sheldon>你提出的是一个猜谜游戏
<1-6,Sheldon>You propose a guessing game

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,260
<1-6,Sheldon>可是你一点猜的时间都不给我
<1-6,Sheldon>yet you don't give me enough time to guess.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,900
<1-6,Sheldon>声明一下  我本来就打算说
<1-6,Sheldon>For the record   I was going to say:

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,160
<1-6,Sheldon>"你的妹妹普丽娅"
<1-6,Sheldon>"Your sister Priya."

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,730
<1-7,Priya>谢尔顿  你一点都没变  对吧
<1-7,Priya>Oh   Sheldon. You haven't changed a bit   have you?

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,840
<1-8,Sheldon>我为什么要变
<1-8,Sheldon>Why would I change?

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,000
<1-9,Leonard>她的本意其实是
<1-9,Leonard>The hope has been that

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,070
<1-9,Leonard>你最终能变得正常一点
<1-9,Leonard>you'd eventually bend to public opinion.

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,210
<1-9,Leonard>普丽娅  什么风把你吹来洛杉矶
<1-9,Leonard>So   Priya   what brings you back to L.A.?

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,340
<1-10,Priya>我本来要去多伦多  但我得在这滞留一天
<1-10,Priya>I have a one-day layover on my way to Toronto.

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,750
<1-10,Priya>企业并购
<1-10,Priya>Corporate merger.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,850
<1-11,Raj>你们相信吗
<1-11,Raj>Can you believe it?

21
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,210
<1-11,Raj>小普丽娅是印度最大汽车公司
<1-11,Raj>Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,650
<1-11,Raj>首席律师之一
<1-11,Raj>for the biggest car company in India.

23
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,690
<1-12,Sheldon>鉴于当时咱们见面  她已经从法学院毕业了
<1-12,Sheldon>Given that when we met her   she was finishing law school

24
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,060
<1-12,Sheldon>而且正打算去一家大的印度汽车公司实习
<1-12,Sheldon>and planning an internship at a large Indian car company

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,960
<1-12,Sheldon>这个结果其实相当合理
<1-12,Sheldon>it's actually extremely plausible.

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,430
<1-13,Leonard>你怎么就这么惹人嫌呢
<1-13,Leonard>And your poll numbers just keep dropping.

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,730
<1-14,Priya>虽然我很想跟大家一起聊聊
<1-14,Priya>I want to catch up with all of you

28
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,470
<1-14,Priya>但我得先去上个厕所
<1-14,Priya>but first I really must visit the loo.

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,630
<1-15,Leonard>我也去  我给你指路吧
<1-15,Leonard>I'm going   too; I'll show you where it is.

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,900
<1-16,Raj>好的  虽然这不用明讲
<1-16,Raj>All right   this goes without saying

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,600
<1-16,Raj>但是无论如何我还是重申一下
<1-16,Raj>but I'm just going to say it anyway.

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,870
<1-16,Raj>不许碰我妹妹
<1-16,Raj>Hands off my sister.

33
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,710
<1-17,Sheldon>我干嘛碰她  她浑身布满了飞机细菌
<1-17,Sheldon>Why would I touch her? She's covered with airplane germs.

34
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,350
<1-18,Raj>我当然不是跟你说  我是跟他说
<1-18,Raj>I'm so not talking to you. I'm talking to him.

35
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,050
<1-19,Howard>-喂  我都是有女朋友的人了  -拜托
<1-19,Howard>- Hey. I've got a girlfriend now.  - Oh   please.

36
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,850
<1-20,Raj>我的妹妹比你那女友辣多了
<1-20,Raj>My sister's much hotter than your girlfriend

37
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,120
<1-20,Raj>这点你心知肚明
<1-20,Raj>and you know it.

38
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,060
<1-21,Howard>她们俩都很辣行了吧
<1-21,Howard>Let's just agree they're both hot.

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,230
<1-22,Raj>但是伙计  你说的可是我妹妹
<1-22,Raj>But dude   that's my sister you're talking about!

40
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,000
<1-23,Howard>算了  不说这个话题
<1-23,Howard>Okay   forget who's hotter.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,030
<1-23,Howard>普丽娅第一次来洛杉矶时  我和莱纳德
<1-23,Howard>The first time Priya came to L.A.   Leonard and I made a pact

42
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,730
<1-23,Howard>出于对我们友情以及对你的尊敬
<1-23,Howard>out of respect to our friendship and to you

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,840
<1-23,Howard>我们约定  谁也不能泡你妹妹
<1-23,Howard>that neither of us would hit on her.

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,470
<1-24,Raj>你们拉钩钩了吗
<1-24,Raj>Did you pinky-swear?

45
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,940
<1-25,Howard>当然
<1-25,Howard>Yes.

46
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,680
<1-26,Raj>那好吧
<1-26,Raj>Okay   then.

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,810
<1-27,Sheldon>补鞋匠的水果派  我到现在还忍不住发笑
<1-27,Sheldon>Cobbler. I'm still laughing.

48
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,180
<2-1,Priya>真高兴再次见到你 莱纳德
<2-1,Priya>It's really nice to see you again   Leonard.

49
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,290
<2-2,Leonard>是啊  我也很高兴见到你
<2-2,Leonard>Yeah. It's good to see you   too.

50
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,290
<2-2,Leonard>你到了
<2-2,Leonard>Here you go.

51
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,460
<2-3,Priya>谢谢
<2-3,Priya>Thanks.

52
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,330
<2-4,Leonard>哇哦  哇哦  哇哦
<2-4,Leonard>Whoa   whoa   whoa   whoa   whoa!

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,500
<1-25,Howard>继续
<1-25,Howard>Okay.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
<1-26,Raj>生活大爆炸
<1-26,Raj>第四季第六集

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,340
<3-1,Howard>你跟你的妹妹有什么特别计划吗
<3-1,Howard>So you got any special plans with your sister?

56
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,740
<3-2,Raj>没有  就是一起出去玩
<3-2,Raj>Oh   not really. Just hang out.

57
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,410
<3-3,Sheldon>我总是跟人说  如果你只能在
<3-3,Sheldon>I always tell people   "If you have only one day

58
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,980
<3-3,Sheldon>洛杉矶呆一天  火车一日游是最佳选择
<3-3,Sheldon>in Los Angeles   make it a train day."

59
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,780
<3-4,Raj>火车一日游
<3-4,Raj>Train day?

60
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,150
<3-5,Sheldon>乐趣始于在影城的卡尼餐厅吃早午饭
<3-5,Sheldon>The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City

61
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,290
<3-5,Sheldon>在改造过的铁路餐车里  有一个热狗站
<3-5,Sheldon>a hotdog stand in a converted railroad dining car.

62
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,220
<3-5,Sheldon>下一站  Travel Town
<3-5,Sheldon>Next stop   Travel Town

63
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,720
<3-5,Sheldon>一家户外的博物馆  专门展出1880年至1930年的
<3-5,Sheldon>an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines

64
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,330
<3-5,Sheldon>铁路引擎  汽车  和其他轨道车辆
<3-5,Sheldon>cars   and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s.

65
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,300
<3-5,Sheldon>最后  我们在浮华与魅力并存的好莱坞下车
<3-5,Sheldon>And   finally   we're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood

66
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,200
<3-5,Sheldon>对  就在好莱坞的卡尼餐厅吃晚饭
<3-5,Sheldon>for dinner at--that's right-- the Hollywood Carney's

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,070
<3-5,Sheldon>那是另外一个改造过的铁路餐车热狗站
<3-5,Sheldon>a hotdog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.

68
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,180
<3-6,Raj>我们才不会玩这个
<3-6,Raj>I don't think we're going to do that.

69
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,610
<3-7,Sheldon>显然  你讨厌寻乐
<3-7,Sheldon>Well   then apparently you hate fun.

70
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,050
<3-8,Leonard>普丽娅还没回来呢
<3-8,Leonard>Priya's not back yet?

71
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,520
<3-8,Leonard>这很正常
<3-8,Leonard>Well   I guess that's not unusual.

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,920
<3-8,Leonard>女人  男人  一个蹲着一个站着
<3-8,Leonard>Women   men   the whole sitting-standing deal.

73
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,390
<3-8,Leonard>咱们刚才聊到哪里了
<3-8,Leonard>So what are we talking about?

74
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,060
<3-9,Raj>我和普丽娅的出游计划
<3-9,Raj>Uh   my plans with Priya.

75
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,030
<3-10,Sheldon>他拒绝火车一日游
<3-10,Sheldon>He rejected Train Day.

76
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,600
<3-11,Leonard>你有说清楚那是两辆不同的火车车厢
<3-11,Leonard>Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,470
<3-11,Leonard>改造成的热狗站吗
<3-11,Leonard>turned into hotdog stands?

78
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,200
<3-12,Sheldon>十分清楚
<3-12,Sheldon>Abundantly.

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,100
<3-13,Leonard>我想他就是讨厌寻乐
<3-13,Leonard>I guess he just hates fun.

80
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,540
<3-14,Sheldon>我也是这么说的
<3-14,Sheldon>That's what I said!

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,350
<3-15,Priya>好了  你们有什么新闻
<3-15,Priya>Okay   so... what's new with you guys?

82
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,780
<3-16,Howard>我有女朋友了
<3-16,Howard>I have a girlfriend now.

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,150
<3-17,Priya>不错嘛
<3-17,Priya>Hey   good for you!

84
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,820
<3-18,Howard>嗯  我就想让大家都知道
<3-18,Howard>Yeah   I just want to put it out there

85
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,880
<3-18,Howard>以防我不经意
<3-18,Howard>in case I inadvertently

86
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,650
<3-18,Howard>朝你喷射出我的性引诱外激素
<3-18,Howard>squirt any pheromones in your direction.

87
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,590
<3-18,Howard>满意了吧
<3-18,Howard>Happy?

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,230
<3-19,Leonard>普丽娅  你有什么安排吗
<3-19,Leonard>So   Priya   what are your plans while you're here?

89
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,230
<3-20,Priya>我不知道  我只有一天时间
<3-20,Priya>I don't know. I just have the one day.

90
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,430
<3-21,Sheldon>你喜欢火车吗
<3-21,Sheldon>Do you like trains?

91
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,900
<3-22,Priya>不是特别喜欢
<3-22,Priya>Not particularly.

92
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,070
<3-23,Sheldon>那你在机场上等着登机就好了
<3-23,Sheldon>You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.

93
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,280
<3-23,Sheldon>你在一片森林当中
<3-23,Sheldon>"You are in a forest.

94
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,950
<4-1,Sheldon>在西面  有一片流沙
<4-1,Sheldon>"There is quicksand to the west

95
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,980
<4-1,Sheldon>有一条通向东面的路
<4-1,Sheldon>a path leads to the east."

96
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,690
<4-1,Sheldon>去东面
<4-1,Sheldon>Go east.

97
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,620
<4-1,Sheldon>一道铁门挡住了你的路
<4-1,Sheldon>"An iron gate blocks your way."

98
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,360
<4-1,Sheldon>开门
<4-1,Sheldon>Open gate.

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,860
<4-1,Sheldon>上锁了
<4-1,Sheldon>"It's locked."

100
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,030
<4-1,Sheldon>这样啊
<4-1,Sheldon>Hmm.

101
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,200
<4-1,Sheldon>那算了
<4-1,Sheldon>Well   so much for that.

102
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,400
<4-2,Leonard>很晚了  你怎么还不睡
<4-2,Leonard>It's getting pretty late. How come you're still up?

103
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,440
<4-3,Sheldon>我刚在网上发现了一款游戏模拟器
<4-3,Sheldon>I found an emulator online that lets you play classic text-based

104
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,910
<4-3,Sheldon>可以玩上世纪80年代的经典文字游戏
<4-3,Sheldon>computer games from the 1980s.

105
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,340
<4-4,Leonard>不错啊
<4-4,Leonard>That's pretty cool.

106
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,750
<4-5,Sheldon>当然了  因为它用到了世界上最强大的图像处理器
<4-5,Sheldon>Oh   yes. It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip:

107
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,020
<4-5,Sheldon>想象力
<4-5,Sheldon>imagination.

108
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,820
<4-6,Leonard>你倒是真该好好发掘一下
<4-6,Leonard>You've really got to get out more.

109
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,860
<4-6,Leonard>向北走
<4-6,Leonard>Go north.

110
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,030
<4-7,Sheldon>你不能走这条路
<4-7,Sheldon>"You can't go that way."

111
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,760
<4-7,Sheldon>向西走
<4-7,Sheldon>Go west.

112
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,160
<4-7,Sheldon>巨魔挡住了你的道路
<4-7,Sheldon>"A troll blocks your passage."

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,470
<4-7,Sheldon>好吧  系好你的安全带
<4-7,Sheldon>Okay. Fasten your seatbelts.

114
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,100
<4-7,Sheldon>剿灭巨魔
<4-7,Sheldon>Kill troll.

115
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,740
<4-7,Sheldon>用什么
<4-7,Sheldon>"With what?"

116
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,840
<4-7,Sheldon>用剑
<4-7,Sheldon>With sword.

117
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,810
<4-7,Sheldon>你没有剑
<4-7,Sheldon>"You don't have the sword."

118
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,980
<4-7,Sheldon>天呐  这种倒霉事真降临到我头上了
<4-7,Sheldon>Good golly   it's as if it's actually happening to me.

119
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,780
<4-8,Priya (at door)>拉杰总算上床睡了
<4-8,Priya (at door)>Raj finally went to bed.

120
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,190
<4-9,Leonard>可谢尔顿还没睡
<4-9,Leonard>Sheldon's still up.

121
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,960
<4-10,Priya>你跟我说过他九点会睡的
<4-10,Priya>You said he goes to bed at 9:00.

122
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,660
<4-11,Leonard>他的确应该睡了  但他刚痴迷于一款电脑游戏...
<4-11,Leonard>Yeah   he does   but he got caught up in a computer game and...

123
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,390
<4-12,Sheldon>用斧头击杀巨魔
<4-12,Sheldon>Hit troll with axe!

124
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,760
<4-12,Sheldon>用斧头击杀巨魔
<4-12,Sheldon>Hit troll with axe!

125
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,430
<4-12,Sheldon>用斧头击杀巨魔
<4-12,Sheldon>Hit troll with axe!

126
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,840
<4-12,Sheldon>服了  这真是个顽强的巨魔
<4-12,Sheldon>My   this is one tough troll.

127
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,500
<4-13,Priya>你没法摆脱他吗
<4-13,Priya>Can't you get rid of him?

128
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,310
<4-14,Leonard>根据以往经验  不可能
<4-14,Leonard>If the past is any indication   no.

129
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,480
<4-15,Sheldon>莱纳德  我陷进流沙里了
<4-15,Sheldon>Leonard   I'm trapped in quicksand!

130
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,310
<4-15,Sheldon>这斧头在拖我下去呢
<4-15,Sheldon>The axe is dragging me down!

131
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,410
<4-16,Leonard>扔掉斧头
<4-16,Leonard>Drop axe!

132
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,950
<4-17,Sheldon>扔掉斧头  英明
<4-17,Sheldon>Drop axe   brilliant!

133
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,290
<4-18,Leonard>稍等一下
<4-18,Leonard>Give me a minute.

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,790
<4-19,Sheldon>-谢尔顿  -等一下
<4-19,Sheldon>- Sheldon. - Hold on.

135
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,790
<4-19,Sheldon>我正在思考如何能拿到桶
<4-19,Sheldon>Trying to figure out how to get the bucket

136
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,260
<4-19,Sheldon>这样我就能扛着泥土越过那条龙了
<4-19,Sheldon>so I can carry the mud past the dragon.

137
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,600
<4-20,Leonard>-谢尔顿  你还得早起工作呢  -我知道
<4-20,Leonard>- Sheldon   you need to work in the morning. - I know!

138
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
<4-22,Leonard>那还不赶紧睡觉
<4-22,Leonard>Well   then bed   mister!

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,940
<4-23,Sheldon>再给我五分钟嘛
<4-23,Sheldon>Five more minutes!

140
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,340
<4-23,Sheldon>你确定吗
<4-23,Sheldon>Really?

141
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,570
<4-24,Leonard>你打算冒着在热力波动学研讨会上打瞌睡的
<4-24,Leonard>You're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your

142
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,840
<4-24,Leonard>风险继续玩下去吗
<4-24,Leonard>thermodynamic fluctuations seminar?

143
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
<4-24,Leonard>你知道自己在公众面前打哈欠的后果吧
<4-24,Leonard>You know what happens when you yawn in public.

144
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,650
<4-25,Sheldon>大家都会看着我形态奇异的小舌头
<4-25,Sheldon>Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.

145
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,690
<4-26,Leonard>你也不想看到这个画面吧
<4-26,Leonard>You don't want that   do you?

146
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,920
<4-26,Leonard>不想
<4-26,Leonard>No.

147
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,760
<4-27,Sheldon>但我们社会嘲笑奇异舌头的做法是可耻的
<4-27,Sheldon>But it's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated.

148
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,300
<4-27,Sheldon>刚才谁敲门了
<4-27,Sheldon>Who was at the door?

149
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
<4-28,Leonard>呃  楼管员
<4-28,Leonard>Uh   building manager.

150
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,170
<4-28,Leonard>他们要来修个管子
<4-28,Leonard>They have to fix a pipe

151
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,840
<4-28,Leonard>所以明天中午到下午两点会停水
<4-28,Leonard>so the water'll be off tomorrow from noon to 2:00.

152
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,370
<4-29,Sheldon>这是让人无法接受的
<4-29,Sheldon>That's unacceptable.

153
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,810
<4-29,Sheldon>我们理应提前得到书面通知的
<4-29,Sheldon>We're supposed to be given written notice.

154
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,610
<4-30,Leonard>没关系的  反正我们到时候也是在工作的
<4-30,Leonard>Well   no   it doesn't matter-- we'll be at work.

155
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,480
<4-31,Sheldon>如果我不小心把番茄汤撒到衣服上怎么办
<4-31,Sheldon>What if I spill tomato soup on my shirt

156
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,850
<4-31,Sheldon>我必须回家来换
<4-31,Sheldon>and have to come home to change

157
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,210
<4-31,Sheldon>结果发现没有水来泡洗衣粉吗
<4-31,Sheldon>only to find there's no water for an enzyme soak?

158
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,320
<4-32,Leonard>别忘了分叉的小舌头  谢尔顿
<4-32,Leonard>Bifurcated uvula   Sheldon!

159
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,220
<4-33,Sheldon>那我明天吃鸡肉面吧  晚安
<4-33,Sheldon>I'll have the chicken noodle. Good night!

160
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,790
<4-34,Leonard (to Priya)>我们一定得注意小声点
<4-34,Leonard (to Priya)>We're going to have to be very quiet.

161
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,470
<4-34,Leonard (to Priya)>我想到如何拿到桶了
<4-34,Leonard (to Priya)>I know how to get the bucket!

162
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,430
<4-35,Sheldon>我可以反过来握斧头
<4-35,Sheldon>I can turn the axe around

163
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,970
<4-35,Sheldon>然后用斧头把钩到水桶
<4-35,Sheldon>and use the handle to reach it.

164
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,940
<4-35,Sheldon>让我试试
<4-35,Sheldon>Let's see.

165
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,380
<4-35,Sheldon>向北走
<4-35,Sheldon>Go north.

166
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,980
<4-35,Sheldon>你现在身处森林
<4-35,Sheldon>"You are in a forest."

167
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,680
<4-35,Sheldon>继续向北走
<4-35,Sheldon>Go north.

168
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,110
<4-35,Sheldon>你仍然身处森林
<4-35,Sheldon>"You are in a forest."

169
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,550
<4-35,Sheldon>再往北走呢
<4-35,Sheldon>Go north.

170
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,220
<4-35,Sheldon>你还是身处森林  天呐  我想我迷路了
<4-35,Sheldon>"You are in a forest." Oh dear   I believe I'm lost.

171
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,290
<4-35,Sheldon>我还是明天从头再玩吧
<4-35,Sheldon>Well   I'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.

172
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,190
<4-36,Leonard>不不不  你刚才只不过方向搞错了而已
<4-36,Leonard>No   no   no! You just took a wrong turn.

173
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,660
<4-36,Leonard>你只要把图画出来就行了
<4-36,Leonard>You just need to map it out.

174
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,660
<4-36,Leonard>来吧  我来帮你
<4-36,Leonard>Come on   I'll help you.

175
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,860
<4-36,Leonard>你停在了小溪旁  然后向北走了三次对吧
<4-36,Leonard>So you stopped at the stream   and you turned north three times?

176
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,600
<4-37,Sheldon>是的
<4-37,Sheldon>Yes.

177
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
<4-38,Leonard>你说对了  你是迷路了  祝你好运
<4-38,Leonard>You're right. You're lost. Good luck.

178
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,240
<5-1,Priya>莱纳德  醒醒
<5-1,Priya>Leonard. Wake up.

179
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
<5-2,Leonard>抱歉
<5-2,Leonard>Huh? Wh-- Sorry.

180
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,770
<5-3,Priya>抱歉什么啊
<5-3,Priya>For what?

181
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,210
<5-4,Leonard>我也不知道  只要我跟女孩子同床共枕后
<5-4,Leonard>I don't know. When I'm in bed with a girl   it's just--

182
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,110
<5-4,Leonard>这就是我的条件反射应答
<5-4,Leonard>it's my go-to response.

183
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,110
<5-5,Priya>已经六点了  我得在拉杰睡醒
<5-5,Priya>It's 6:00. I have to get back to Raj's

184
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,950
<5-5,Priya>发现我不见了之前  赶紧回去了
<5-5,Priya>before he wakes up and realizes I'm gone.

185
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,320
<5-6,Leonard>哦  那好吧
<5-6,Leonard>Oh. Right. Sure.

186
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,850
<5-6,Leonard>我真希望你能在洛杉矶待久点
<5-6,Leonard>I wish you could stay in L.A. a while longer.

187
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,850
<5-7,Priya>我也想啊
<5-7,Priya>Mmm   me   too.

188
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,390
<5-8,Leonard>知道吗  我刚才一直在想
<5-8,Leonard>You know   I was thinking

189
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,290
<5-8,Leonard>印度其实也有这么多先进的实验设施了
<5-8,Leonard>there are some great research facilities in India.

190
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,100
<5-9,Priya>你想说什么  莱纳德
<5-9,Priya>Where are you going with this   Leonard?

191
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,870
<5-10,Leonard>我其实想说  反正我在这也没啥牵挂
<5-10,Leonard>Well   I'm just saying   you know   I don't have any real ties here

192
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,070
<5-10,Leonard>我也可以搬去新德里[印度城市]  我们可以一起  你懂得
<5-10,Leonard>so if I were to move to New Delhi   we could   you know--

193
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,940
<5-10,Leonard>出去玩玩
<5-10,Leonard>go out.

194
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,580
<5-11,Priya>莱纳德  我们五年前不就谈过这个了吗
<5-11,Priya>Leonard   didn't we have this conversation five years ago?

195
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,540
<5-12,Leonard>是这样的  但是...
<5-12,Leonard>Well   yes   but...

196
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,780
<5-12,Leonard>今非昔比了嘛
<5-12,Leonard>things have changed.

197
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,380
<5-12,Leonard>你也长大了  我也长大了
<5-12,Leonard>You know   you're older   I'm older--

198
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,580
<5-12,Leonard>看吧  再也没什么漫画英雄的床单了
<5-12,Leonard>Look   no more superhero bed sheets.

199
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,050
<5-13,Priya>亲爱的
<5-13,Priya>Sweetheart

200
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,050
<5-13,Priya>我们在一起很愉快  并不意味着
<5-13,Priya>just because we have fun when I come to town doesn't mean

201
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,660
<5-13,Priya>我想要开展一段正式的感情生活
<5-13,Priya>I want to have a serious relationship.

202
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,020
<5-15,Priya>-不想吗  -不想
<5-15,Priya>- It doesn't? - Mm-mm.

203
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,290
<5-15,Priya>此外  我永远也不可能介绍个白种男孩给我的父母
<5-15,Priya>And besides   I could never bring a white boy home to my parents.

204
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,360
<5-15,Priya>他们宁愿要头牛
<5-15,Priya>They'd have a cow.

205
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,000
<5-15,Priya>这在印度可就很大件事了
<5-15,Priya>Which is a much bigger deal in India.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,430
<5-16,Leonard>我也没很纯的白人血统啦
<5-16,Leonard>I'm not that white.

207
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,500
<5-16,Leonard>我的高祖母有一半彻罗基[印第安族]血统
<5-16,Leonard>My great-great-grandmother was half Cherokee.

208
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,570
<5-16,Leonard>我知道虽然不是真正的印度血统  但也算印什么了啊
<5-16,Leonard>I know that's not the right kind of Indian   but it is something.

209
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,270
<5-17,Priya>你真有趣
<5-17,Priya>You're funny.

210
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,610
<5-18,Sheldon>莱纳德
<5-18,Sheldon>Leonard?

211
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,780
<5-18,Sheldon>莱纳德
<5-18,Sheldon>Leonard?

212
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,280
<5-18,Sheldon>莱纳德
<5-18,Sheldon>Leonard?

213
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,150
<5-19,Leonard>啥事
<5-19,Leonard>What?

214
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,750
<5-20,Sheldon>我听到了女人的笑声
<5-20,Sheldon>I heard a woman laughing.

215
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,150
<5-21,Leonard>哦  我刚才想试试自己能否笑得像个女人
<5-21,Leonard>Oh   uh   yeah. I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.

216
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,790
<5-22,Sheldon>哦  那做的不错啊  很真实啊
<5-22,Sheldon>Oh! Well   good job. Quite convincing.

217
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,260
<5-22,Sheldon>我闻到了香水味
<5-22,Sheldon>I smell perfume.

218
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,330
<5-23,Leonard>空气清洗剂的味道
<5-23,Leonard>Air freshener.

219
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,900
<5-24,Sheldon>你这脸颊和脖子上是口红吗
<5-24,Sheldon>And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck?

220
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,230
<5-25,Leonard>是疹子  很严重的疹子
<5-25,Leonard>Rash. That's a bad rash.

221
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,830
<5-26,Sheldon>深表同情
<5-26,Sheldon>My sympathies.

222
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,340
<5-26,Sheldon>我很了解这种红色祸害  也就是皮炎
<5-26,Sheldon>I'm no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis.

223
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,340
<5-26,Sheldon>我在我的乳液和软膏系列里
<5-26,Sheldon>Can I interest you in a topical steroid

224
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,310
<5-26,Sheldon>帮你找一种管用的类固醇好吗
<5-26,Sheldon>from my lotion and unguent collection?

225
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,310
<5-27,Leonard>好啊  好啊  这主意不错
<5-27,Leonard>Uh   yeah   yeah   that sounds great.

226
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,480
<5-28,Sheldon>很好  我相信我可以找到
<5-28,Sheldon>Very well. I'm sure I can find something

227
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,220
<5-28,Sheldon>帮你止痒的东西
<5-28,Sheldon>that will help you ditch that itch.

228
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,360
<5-29,Leonard>好了  他去洗手间了  我们走
<5-29,Leonard>Okay   he's in the bathroom. Let's go.

229
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,030
<5-30,Sheldon>你喜欢软膏还是霜剂
<5-30,Sheldon>Do you prefer ointment or cream?

230
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,430
<5-31,Leonard>霜剂
<5-31,Leonard>Cream.

231
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,770
<5-32,Sheldon>要不要含麻醉添加剂的
<5-32,Sheldon>With or without a numbing agent?

232
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,770
<5-33,Leonard>不要
<5-33,Leonard>Without.

233
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,170
<5-34,Sheldon>真的吗  莱纳德
<5-34,Sheldon>Really   Leonard?

234
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,840
<5-34,Sheldon>有皮炎的时候可不能逞英雄
<5-34,Sheldon>There are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.

235
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,790
<5-35,Leonard>好吧  那就要
<5-35,Leonard>Fine. With.

236
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,770
<5-36,Sheldon>处方药还是非处方的强效药
<5-36,Sheldon>Prescription or non-prescription strength?

237
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,210
<5-37,Leonard>发挥你的判断力吧
<5-37,Leonard>Use your best judgment.

238

<5-38,Sheldon>我有一支很不错的2009年的肛泰软膏
<5-38,Sheldon>Well   I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC.

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,380
<5-38,Sheldon>通常是针对严重发炎的痔疮的
<5-38,Sheldon>It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed hemorrhoids

240
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,650
<5-38,Sheldon>但是对非粘膜器官也管用
<5-38,Sheldon>but it also goes nicely with non-mucosal body parts.

241
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,790
<5-39,Leonard>听起来不错
<5-39,Leonard>Sounds great.

242
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,430
<5-40,Sheldon>明智的选择
<5-40,Sheldon>Excellent choice.

248
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,980
<5-44,Sheldon>我居然还差点准备
<5-44,Sheldon>And to think   I was ready to waste

249
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,270
<5-44,Sheldon>把我最后一点好用的痔疮霜浪费在你身上
<5-44,Sheldon>the last of my good hemorrhoid cream on you.

250
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,590
<6-1,Leonard>挺开心的啊
<6-1,Leonard>Making pretty good time   huh?

251
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,220
<6-2,Sheldon>你真的想说这个吗  莱纳德
<6-2,Sheldon>Is that really what you want to talk about   Leonard?

252
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,970
<6-3,Leonard>不是
<6-3,Leonard>No.

253
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,940
<6-4,Sheldon>那你想说什么
<6-4,Sheldon>What do you want to talk about?

254
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,070
<6-5,Leonard>拜托别跟任何人说
<6-5,Leonard>Please don't tell anyone

255
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,540
<6-5,Leonard>我跟拉杰的妹妹过夜了
<6-5,Leonard>I spent the night with Raj's sister.

256
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
<6-6,Sheldon>说出来了
<6-6,Sheldon>There it is.

257
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,410
<6-6,Sheldon>要是有人问起来呢
<6-6,Sheldon>What if someone asks?

258
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,010
<6-7,Leonard>没人会问我是不是跟拉杰的妹妹过夜了
<6-7,Leonard>No one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister.

259
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,120
<6-8,Sheldon>或许吧  但是他们可能会问我别的
<6-8,Sheldon>Perhaps   but they might ask me something else.

260
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,450
<6-9,Leonard>-比如呢  -比如说
<6-9,Leonard>- Like what?  - Like

<6-10,Sheldon>"Has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"

262
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,130
<6-11,Leonard>普丽娅和我都是成年人了
<6-11,Leonard>Priya and I are both adults.

263
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,830
<6-11,Leonard>我没有背叛拉杰
<6-11,Leonard>I didn't betray Raj.

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,320
<6-12,Sheldon>你有  但是我指的是霍华德
<6-12,Sheldon>In fact   you did   but I was referring to Howard.

265
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,470
<6-13,Leonard>你在说什么
<6-13,Leonard>What are you talking about?

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,140
<6-14,Sheldon>拉杰第一次把普丽娅介绍给我们
<6-14,Sheldon>Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time.

269
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,280
<6-14,Sheldon>她正在享受印度教禁止的美味食物
<6-14,Sheldon>She was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion

<6-14,Sheldon>那就是鲍勃超级大头娃牛肉堡
<6-14,Sheldon>in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger.

271
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,460
<6-14,Sheldon>为了维护你们的友谊
<6-14,Sheldon>In order to preserve your friendship

272
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,520
<6-14,Sheldon>你和霍华德发拉钩钩说
<6-14,Sheldon>you and Howard made a pinky swear

273
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,850
<6-14,Sheldon>你们俩人都不许追求她
<6-14,Sheldon>that neither of you would attempt to woo her.

274
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,900
<6-14,Sheldon>我点了一份奶酪牛肉片
<6-14,Sheldon>I had a patty melt.

275
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,930
<6-15,Leonard>好吧  我背叛了霍华德
<6-15,Leonard>Okay   fine   I betrayed Howard.

<6-16,Sheldon>-还有拉杰  -好的  还有拉杰
<6-16,Sheldon>- And Raj.  - All right   and Raj.

277

<6-18,Sheldon>还有我
<6-18,Sheldon>And me.

278
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,090
<6-19,Leonard>你
<6-19,Leonard>You?

<6-21,Leonard>好吧  我是个令人讨厌的家伙
<6-21,Leonard>Okay   fine   I-I'm a horrible human being.

282
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,240
<6-21,Leonard>我就是帕萨迪纳的达斯·维达
<6-21,Leonard>I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

284
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,940
<6-22,Sheldon>你当达斯·维达还太矮了点
<6-22,Sheldon>You're far too short to be Darth Vader.

285
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,320
<6-22,Sheldon>你最多也就是叛徒伊渥克[星球大战]
<6-22,Sheldon>At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.

286
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,180
<6-23,Leonard>我只是想说  普丽娅已经走了
<6-23,Leonard>My point is: Priya's gone and it would be much better

287
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,890
<6-23,Leonard>要是没人知道这件事就最好了
<6-23,Leonard>if no one else found out about us.

288
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,750
<6-24,Sheldon>你是说你想让我帮你保密
<6-24,Sheldon>You mean you want me to keep a secret?

289
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,790
<6-25,Leonard>是的
<6-25,Leonard>Yes.

290
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,460
<6-26,Sheldon>你知道我是保守不了秘密的
<6-26,Sheldon>You know I can't keep a secret.

291
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,530
<6-27,Leonard>你努力尝试的话就可以的
<6-27,Leonard>You can if you try.

292
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,760
<6-27,Leonard>就这样想
<6-27,Leonard>Think about it this way:

293
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,660
<6-27,Leonard>如果我是蝙蝠侠  你是艾尔福
<6-27,Leonard>um   if I were Batman and you were Alfred

295
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,600
<6-27,Leonard>你一定可以对我的身份保密  对吧
<6-27,Leonard>you'd keep that secret   right?

296
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,400
<6-28,Sheldon>凭什么你是蝙蝠侠
<6-28,Sheldon>Why do you get to be Batman?

297
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,540
<6-29,Leonard>因为蝙蝠侠才有身份的秘密呀
<6-29,Leonard>Because Batman has the secret.

298
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,370
<6-30,Sheldon>艾尔福也有秘密的
<6-30,Sheldon>Alfred has secrets   too.

299
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,940
<6-31,Leonard>-什么秘密  -艾尔福知道
<6-31,Leonard>- Like what?  - Alfred knows

300
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,610
<6-32,Sheldon>芭芭拉·科尔顿是蝙蝠女
<6-32,Sheldon>that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl.

301
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,740
<6-32,Sheldon>而我刚刚就把这个秘密告诉了蝙蝠侠
<6-32,Sheldon>Which I've now just told to Batman.

302
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,430
<6-32,Sheldon>你看  我就是保守不了秘密
<6-32,Sheldon>See   I cannot keep a secret.

303
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,680
<7-1,Sheldon>挞哒
<7-1,Sheldon>Ta-dah!

304
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,320
<5-19,Leonard>什么

305
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,660
<7-1,Sheldon>挞哒
<7-1,Sheldon>Ta-dah.

306
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,690
<7-3,Sheldon>这是
<7-3,Sheldon>It's short for...

307
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,660
<7-3,Sheldon>哒哒哒哒的缩减版
<7-3,Sheldon>Da-da-da-da! ?

308
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,290
<7-4,Leonard>谢尔顿  我正忙着呢
<7-4,Leonard>Kind of busy here   Sheldon.

309
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,630
<7-5,Sheldon>我知道  所以我才缩减了
<7-5,Sheldon>I know   that's why I shortened it.

310
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,160
<7-6,Leonard>你想干吗
<7-6,Leonard>What do you want?

311
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,870
<7-7,Sheldon>我是来给你提供昨晚的不在场证明的
<7-7,Sheldon>I came to go over your alibi for last night.

312
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,300
<7-8,Leonard>什么不在场证明
<7-8,Leonard>What alibi?

313
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,570
<7-9,Sheldon>你让我替你撒谎  而你也知道
<7-9,Sheldon>You've asked me to lie on your behalf   and as you know

314
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,580
<7-9,Sheldon>我很讨厌没有提前准备的谎言
<7-9,Sheldon>I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonesty

315
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,910
<7-9,Sheldon>所以我就给你准备了不在场的铁证
<7-9,Sheldon>so I've provided you with an ironclad alibi.

316
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,580
<7-9,Sheldon>你昨晚不可能跟普丽娅过夜
<7-9,Sheldon>You couldn't have spent last night with Priya

317
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,650
<7-9,Sheldon>因为你跟另一个女人在一起
<7-9,Sheldon>because you were with another woman.

318
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,890
<7-10,Leonard>我一定会后悔的
<7-10,Leonard>Oh   I'm so sure I'm gonna regret this

319
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,990
<7-10,Leonard>但我还是要问  我跟谁在一起
<7-10,Leonard>but who was I with?

329
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,220
<7-15,Sheldon>打这个号码查证的话  他们会听到
<7-15,Sheldon>to actually call that number   they will hear this.

<7-17,Sheldon>It's pretty convincing   huh?

334
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,530
<7-17,Sheldon>那都不是真人发声
<7-17,Sheldon>That wasn't even a real person.

335
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,800
<7-17,Sheldon>最后还有
<7-17,Sheldon>And here is the clincher:

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,780
<7-21,Sheldon>说真的  你想得太多了

352
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,400
<8-3,Leonard>现在喜欢谁  以前喜欢过谁
<8-3,Leonard>who she is attracted to or was attracted to

353
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,040
<8-3,Leonard>将来又会喜欢上谁啊
<8-3,Leonard>or who she might be attracted to in the future?

354
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,680
<8-4,Sheldon>我对这个话题
<8-4,Sheldon>And I have nothing to contribute

355
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,550
<8-4,Sheldon>毫无建设性意见
<8-4,Sheldon>to this conversation.

356
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,550
<8-4,Sheldon>因为我也完全不知道
<8-4,Sheldon>Because I   too   know absolutely nothing

357
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,620
<8-4,Sheldon>普丽娅对男性伴侣的偏好
<8-4,Sheldon>about Priya's preferences in male companionship.

358
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,120
<8-4,Sheldon>所以  我会再次闭上嘴
<8-4,Sheldon>And with that   I will re-zip my lip.

359
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,330
<8-5,Raj>对了  你们觉得昨晚
<8-5,Raj>Hey   so what did you guys think

360
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,360
<8-5,Raj>卡布里卡的最新一集怎么样
<8-5,Raj>of the new episode of Caprica last night?

361
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,330
<8-6,Leonard>我没看
<8-6,Leonard>I didn't see it.

362
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,260
<8-6,Leonard>啥  没看
<8-6,Leonard>Didn't see it?

363
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,860
<8-7,Howard>那你在干什么
<8-7,Howard>What were you doing?

364
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,800
<8-8,Leonard>我出去了
<8-8,Leonard>Uh   I was out.

365
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
<8-9,Raj>啥  昨天可是卡布里卡之夜
<8-9,Raj>What   on Caprica night?

366
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,910
<8-10,Leonard>是啊  我出去喝了一杯
<8-10,Leonard>Yeah   I   uh   went for a drink.

367
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,140
<8-11,Howard>真的假的  就你
<8-11,Howard>Really   you?

368
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,910
<8-11,Howard>你去哪儿了
<8-11,Howard>Where   w-where'd you go?

369
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,150
<8-12,Leonard>去了...
<8-12,Leonard>To   uh...

370
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,090
<8-12,Leonard>幸运鲍德温酒吧
<8-12,Leonard>Lucky Baldwin's.

371
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,990
<8-13,Sheldon>我听说过那地方
<8-13,Sheldon>Oh   I've heard of that place.

372
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,730
<8-13,Sheldon>那不是帕萨迪纳最受欢迎的爱尔兰酒吧么
<8-13,Sheldon>Isn't that Pasadena's favorite Irish watering hole?

373
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,500
<8-14,Leonard>没错
<8-14,Leonard>Yes.

374
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,800
<8-15,Sheldon>你有没有在那里
<8-15,Sheldon>Did you meet

375
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,070
<8-15,Sheldon>遇到谈得来的人
<8-15,Sheldon>anyone interesting there

376
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,300
<8-15,Sheldon>是不是个滥交的红发调酒师
<8-15,Sheldon>perhaps a promiscuous   redheaded barmaid?

377
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,310
<8-16,Leonard>说实话  我不行了
<8-16,Leonard>As a matter of fact... I-I-I-I-I can't   I can't

378
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,740
<8-16,Leonard>我做不到
<8-16,Leonard>I can't do it.

379
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,310
<8-17,Sheldon>你当然可以  你做得很好  相当令人信服
<8-17,Sheldon>Sure you can   you're doing fine   it's very believable.

380
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,780
<8-18,Leonard>我很抱歉  拉杰  但事实上
<8-18,Leonard>I'm sorry   Raj   but the truth is

381
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,650
<8-18,Leonard>昨晚我和普丽娅在一起
<8-18,Leonard>I was with Priya last night.

382
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,850
<8-19,Sheldon>别听他的
<8-19,Sheldon>Don't listen to him.

383
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,620
<8-19,Sheldon>他还满脑子爱尔兰威士忌和熏蛋
<8-19,Sheldon>He's still light-headed from all the Irish whiskey

384
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,490
<8-19,Sheldon>一团浆糊呢
<8-19,Sheldon>and pickled eggs in his system.

385
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,420
<8-20,Raj>你和普丽娅在一起做什么
<8-20,Raj>What were you doing with Priya?

386
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,460
<8-21,Sheldon>我确信他们是在性交
<8-21,Sheldon>I believe they engaged in coitus

387
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,260
<8-21,Sheldon>但更重要的是
<8-21,Sheldon>but more importantly

388
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,030
<8-21,Sheldon>如果莱纳德没有半途而废
<8-21,Sheldon>if Leonard had not abandoned his story

389
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,460
<8-21,Sheldon>你觉得那个故事可信么
<8-21,Sheldon>would you have found it plausible?

390
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,000
<8-22,Raj>你上了我妹妹
<8-22,Raj>You slept with my sister?!

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,930
<8-23,Leonard>对
<8-23,Leonard>Yeah.

392
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,170
<8-24,Howard>你怎么可以这样  我们约定好的
<8-24,Howard>How could you? We had a pact.

393
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,970
<8-25,Raj>不好意思  我认为"你情何以堪  她可是我妹妹"
<8-25,Raj>Excuse me   I think "How could you? She's my sister"

394
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,170
<8-25,Raj>总比小孩子的勾勾手约定重要吧
<8-25,Raj>takes precedence over a five-year-old pinky swear.

395
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,610
<8-26,Sheldon>请允许我指出
<8-26,Sheldon>May I point out

396
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,840
<8-26,Sheldon>要是在平行世界  你的朋友会说
<8-26,Sheldon>in a parallel universe   your friends are saying

397
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,480
<8-26,Sheldon>"麦琪·麦凯瑞  这名字听起来真可爱"
<8-26,Sheldon>"Maggie McGarry-- she sounds lovely."

398
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,950
<8-27,Leonard>听着  我承认  我是越线了
<8-27,Leonard>Look   I-I admit it   I may have crossed a line here

399
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,520
<8-27,Leonard>但是拉杰  得了  你妹妹都成年了
<8-27,Leonard>but come on   Raj   your sister is a grown woman

400
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,420
<8-27,Leonard>对她来说  我不过是块禁忌的白巧克力罢了
<8-27,Leonard>and to her   I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.

401
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,520
<8-28,Raj>真是难以置信
<8-28,Raj>I don't believe it.

402
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,930
<8-28,Raj>这是对我信任莫大的背叛
<8-28,Raj>This is a terrible betrayal of my trust.

403
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,590
<8-29,Leonard>要是我告诉你  我向她献出真心
<8-29,Leonard>No   w-w-would it help if I told you

404
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,530
<8-29,Leonard>却被她狠狠践踏  你会好受点么
<8-29,Leonard>that I offered her my heart   and she kind of stomped on it?

405
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,300
<8-30,Raj>她践踏得多狠
<8-30,Raj>How hard did she stomp?

406
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
<8-31,Leonard>相当狠
<8-31,Leonard>Very hard.

407
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,640
<8-32,Raj>好吧  好受多了
<8-32,Raj>Okay   I'm good.

408
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,680
<8-33,Howard>那个  拉杰
<8-33,Howard>Well   Raj

409
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,080
<8-33,Howard>我只是想说  我绝不会背叛你
<8-33,Howard>I just want to say that I'd never betray your trust.

410
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,650
<8-33,Howard>不会像莱纳德那样  我尊重你
<8-33,Howard>Unlike Leonard   I respect you.

411
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,650
<8-34,Leonard>真的么
<8-34,Leonard>Really?

412
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,320
<8-35,Howard>当然
<8-35,Howard>Mm-hmm.

413
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,450
<8-36,Leonard>你瞒着拉杰  你把他的iPhone
<8-36,Leonard>Was it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj

414
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,090
<8-36,Leonard>掉进了便池  这算哪门子尊重
<8-36,Leonard>about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?

415
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,230
<8-37,Raj>神马  我还把那玩意贴我脸上呢
<8-37,Raj>Dude   I put that thing on my face!

416
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,100
<8-38,Sheldon>我觉得对拉杰最有趣的欺骗
<8-38,Sheldon>I think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust

417
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,730
<8-38,Sheldon>是霍华德居然让他相信
<8-38,Sheldon>is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents

418
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,670
<8-38,Sheldon>感恩节外国人要送美国人礼物
<8-38,Sheldon>to Americans on Thanksgiving.

419
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,070
<8-39,Howard>喂  我也没看到你
<8-39,Howard>Hey   I didn't see you giving back

420
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,910
<8-39,Howard>把他送你的史努比刨冰机还给他啊
<8-39,Howard>your Snoopy snow cone maker.

421
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,040
<8-40,Raj>那都是骗我的吗
<8-40,Raj>That was all a lie?

422
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,180
<8-40,Raj>今年的礼物我都准备好了
<8-40,Raj>This year's gifts are already wrapped.

423
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,910
<8-41,Howard>既然我们谈到背叛朋友的事
<8-41,Howard>And as long as we're talking about betraying our friends

424
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,380
<8-41,Howard>何不说说谢尔顿曾经整个月都
<8-41,Howard>how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects

425
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,120
<8-41,Howard>把虫子磨碎再混进莱纳德的食物里
<8-41,Howard>and mixing them into Leonard's food?

426
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,490
<8-42,Sheldon>不好意思
<8-42,Sheldon>Well   excuse me.

427
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,090
<8-42,Sheldon>那又不算背叛
<8-42,Sheldon>That was not a betrayal.

428
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,220
<8-42,Sheldon>这只是个实验  用来证明
<8-42,Sheldon>That was an experiment to determine

429
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,430
<8-42,Sheldon>什么浓度会使食物尝起来有"蛀虫"感
<8-42,Sheldon>at what concentration food starts tasting "mothy."

430
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,600
<8-43,Leonard>你在我食物里放虫子
<8-43,Leonard>You put moths in my food?!

431
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,470
<8-44,Sheldon>为了科学而献身
<8-44,Sheldon>For science.

432
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,940
<8-45,Raj>你居然用吃过虫子的嘴吻我妹妹
<8-45,Raj>I can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.

433
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,110
<8-46,Leonard>你还用了谢尔顿的牙刷呢
<8-46,Leonard>Well   I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush.

434
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,410
<8-47,Sheldon>你用了我的牙刷
<8-47,Sheldon>You used my toothbrush?

435
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,310
<8-48,Raj>没用刷毛的部分  不过是用那橡皮垫
<8-48,Raj>Not the brush part   just the little rubber thing

436
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,150
<8-48,Raj>剔了剔我的牙  顺便揉了揉牙床
<8-48,Raj>to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.

437
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,830
<8-49,Leonard>好吧  我想我可以说
<8-49,Leonard>Okay   I-I think it's safe to say

438
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,330
<8-49,Leonard>我们都做过一些
<8-49,Leonard>that we've all done some things

439
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,100
<8-49,Leonard>不那么光彩的事
<8-49,Leonard>we're not particularly proud of.

440
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,260
<8-49,Leonard>但是算了  我们是朋友
<8-49,Leonard>But come on   we're friends.

441
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,240
<8-49,Leonard>朋友会互相谅解彼此的小错误
<8-49,Leonard>Friends overlook each other's minor lapses.

442
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,240
<8-49,Leonard>所以  霍华德  我很抱歉背叛了我们的约定
<8-49,Leonard>For the record   Howard   I'm sorry that I broke our pact.

443
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,580
<8-49,Leonard>多谢
<8-49,Leonard>Thank you.

444
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,410
<8-50,Howard>我很抱歉把你的iPhone掉进了便池
<8-50,Howard>And I'm sorry about your phone

445
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,210
<8-50,Howard>还有感恩节的事
<8-50,Howard>and Thanksgiving.

446
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,580
<8-50,Howard>既然说到这个
<8-50,Howard>And while we're at it

447
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,020
<8-50,Howard>其实国庆节你也不用替我们洗衣服
<8-50,Howard>you don't have to wash our clothes on the Fourth of July.

448
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,590
<8-51,Raj>既然你们都道歉了
<8-51,Raj>As long as we're apologizing

449
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,820
<8-51,Raj>谢尔顿  很抱歉我用了你的牙刷
<8-51,Raj>Sheldon   I'm   I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.

450
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,060
<8-51,Raj>我也很抱歉...
<8-51,Raj>And I'm sorry...

451
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,560
<8-52,Sheldon>那这种行为让人忍无可忍
<8-52,Sheldon>but that behavior is beyond the pale

452
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,230
<8-52,Sheldon>不可原谅
<8-52,Sheldon>and cannot be tolerated.

453
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,360
<8-52,Sheldon>我们不再是朋友了
<8-52,Sheldon>We are no longer friends.

454
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,400
<8-53,Raj>感恩节我送你个托马斯蒸汽火车头
<8-53,Raj>I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

455
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,370
<8-54,Sheldon>会喷真的烟吗
<8-54,Sheldon>With real puffing smoke?

456
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,610
<8-55,Raj>会
<8-55,Raj>Yes.

457
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,940
<8-55,Raj>好吧
<8-55,Raj>All right.

458
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,950
<8-56,Sheldon>但我记住你了
<8-56,Sheldon>But I'm watching you.

459
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,970
<9-1,Leonard>哎呀  你把史努比拿出来了
<9-1,Leonard>Hey   you've got Snoopy out.

460
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,170
<9-1,Leonard>我能来一杯刨冰么
<9-1,Leonard>Can I have a snow cone?

461
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,040
<9-2,Sheldon>当然
<9-2,Sheldon>Well   sure.

462
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
<9-2,Sheldon>味道不错
<9-2,Sheldon>This is pretty good.

463
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,250
<9-3,Leonard>这是什么味道
<9-3,Leonard>What flavor is this?

464
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,150
<9-4,Sheldon>猜猜
<9-4,Sheldon>Guess.

465
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,750
<9-5,Leonard>-木瓜吗  -不是
<9-5,Leonard>- Papaya? - No.

466
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,390
<9-8,Sheldon>-石榴呢  -接近了
<9-8,Sheldon>- Guava? - You're so close.

467
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,390
<9-9,Leonard>我放弃  是什么
<9-9,Leonard>I give up.

468
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,790
<9-10,Sheldon>芒果毛毛虫
