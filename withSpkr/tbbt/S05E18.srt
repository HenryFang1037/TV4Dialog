1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,280
<1-1,Leonard>我去商店里买点东西
<1-1,Leonard>I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,330
<1-1,Leonard>等你剪完再来接你
<1-1,Leonard>I'll pick you up when you're done.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,130
<1-1,Leonard>好
<1-1,Leonard>Okay.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,670
<1-2,Sheldon>我比较喜欢你在这儿陪我  不过没关系
<1-2,Sheldon>I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,640
<1-3,Barber>嗨  谢尔顿
<1-3,Barber>Hey, Sheldon.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,720
<1-4,Sheldon>嗨  我来找诺费奥先生为我理发
<1-4,Sheldon>Hello. I'm here for my haircut with Mr. D'Onofrio.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,960
<1-5,Barber>真抱歉  托尼舅舅还在医院呢
<1-5,Barber>I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's in the hospital.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,180
<1-5,Barber>他病得很厉害
<1-5,Barber>He's pretty sick.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,480
<1-6,Sheldon>天啊  诺费奥先生在医院
<1-6,Sheldon>Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's in the hospital.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,090
<1-6,Sheldon>我的命运为何如此多舛
<1-6,Sheldon>Why do these things always happen to me?

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,510
<1-7,Barber>我可以帮你理发
<1-7,Barber>I can cut it for you.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,350
<1-8,Sheldon>你不是诺费奥先生
<1-8,Sheldon>You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,320
<1-8,Sheldon>我的头发一般是诺费奥先生理的
<1-8,Sheldon>I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,230
<1-8,Sheldon>你信得过这家伙吗
<1-8,Sheldon>You believe this guy?

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,700
<1-9,Leonard>先失陪一下
<1-9,Leonard>Excuse us for a second.

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,470
<1-9,Leonard>谢尔顿  没关系  他能行的
<1-9,Leonard>Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.

17
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,330
<1-9,Leonard>他也是个理发师
<1-9,Leonard>He's a barber.

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,190
<1-10,Sheldon>他不是理发师  他是理发师的外甥
<1-10,Sheldon>He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,360
<1-10,Sheldon>他就是理发界日益猖獗的
<1-10,Sheldon>He's an example of the kind of nepotism

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,130
<1-10,Sheldon>裙带关系的典型范例
<1-10,Sheldon>that runs rampant in the barbering industry.

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,660
<1-10,Sheldon>另外  诺费奥先生很清楚我喜欢什么样的发型
<1-10,Sheldon>Besides, Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,300
<1-10,Sheldon>因为他有我在德州理发时的理发记录
<1-10,Sheldon>because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,660
<1-11,Leonard>你在瞎扯什么啊
<1-11,Leonard>What are you talking about?

24
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,190
<1-12,Sheldon>我刚搬来这里的时候
<1-12,Sheldon>When I first moved here,

25
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,040
<1-12,Sheldon>找新理发师这事儿很让我发愁
<1-12,Sheldon>I was nervous about finding a new barber,

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,320
<1-12,Sheldon>所以我妈就把我的理发记录
<1-12,Sheldon>so my mother had all my haircut records

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,210
<1-12,Sheldon>都寄给了诺费奥先生
<1-12,Sheldon>sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

28
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,920
<1-13,Leonard>根本没有理发记录这回事
<1-13,Leonard>There's no such thing as haircut records.

29
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,540
<1-14,Sheldon>不  肯定有的
<1-14,Sheldon>Yes, there are.

30
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,740
<1-15,Leonard>你见过你的理发记录吗
<1-15,Leonard>Have you ever seen them?

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,160
<1-16,Sheldon>没  不过我妈妈保证肯定寄过来了
<1-16,Sheldon>No, but my mother assured me they were sent here,

32
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,070
<1-16,Sheldon>我敢跟你打包票
<1-16,Sheldon>and I'll bet you dollars to donuts

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,570
<1-16,Sheldon>这家伙肯定没我的理发记录
<1-16,Sheldon>that this one doesn't have them.

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,160
<1-16,Sheldon>打扰一下
<1-16,Sheldon>Uh, excuse me.

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,010
<1-16,Sheldon>你能拿到我的理发记录吗
<1-16,Sheldon>Do you have access to my haircut records?

36
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,200
<1-17,Barber>你的什么
<1-17,Barber>Your what?

37
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,640
<1-17,Barber>托马斯·斯特恩斯·艾略特
<1-17,Barber>著名美国诗人  诺贝尔文学奖得主

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,640
<1-18,Sheldon>用T·S·艾略特的诗来说
<1-18,Sheldon>To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,480
<1-18,Sheldon>这句改自他的作品《空心人》  原文为
<1-18,Sheldon>"世界就是这样告终的  不是砰的一声而是一声抽泣"

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,120
<1-18,Sheldon>世界就是这样告终的
<1-18,Sheldon>this is the way the world ends--

41
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,480
<1-18,Sheldon>不是砰的一声而是一个外甥
<1-18,Sheldon>not with a bang but with a nephew.

42
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,230
<1-19,Leonard>谢尔顿  你都是个大人了  他也是专业人士
<1-19,Leonard>Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional,

43
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,330
<1-19,Leonard>而且你的发型是1946年那张海报上的第三个
<1-19,Leonard>and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946.

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,700
<1-19,Leonard>赶紧坐下
<1-19,Leonard>Just sit down

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,930
<1-19,Leonard>让他给你剪吧
<1-19,Leonard>and let him do it.

46
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,430
<1-20,Sheldon>好吧  如果我剪完看起来个傻蛋
<1-20,Sheldon>Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork,

47
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,490
<1-20,Sheldon>那就全赖你
<1-20,Sheldon>it's on you.

48
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,190
<1-21,Barber>我家小孩今天讲了件特别有意思的事
<1-21,Barber>So my kid said the funniest thing today.

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,140
<1-22,Sheldon>算了
<1-22,Sheldon>Nope.

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,710
<1-23,Leonard>如果你日后跟别人说这事
<1-23,Leonard>When you tell this story later,

51
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,430
<1-23,Leonard>记得用"古怪"这个词来形容
<1-23,Leonard>the word we usually use is "quirky."

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,130
<2-1,Sheldon>你能把帕马森干酪递给我吗
<2-1,Sheldon>Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?

62
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,610
<2-1,Sheldon>好
<2-1,Sheldon>Sure.

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,180
<2-2,Leonard>你这是干嘛
<2-2,Leonard>What are you doing?

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,990
<2-3,Sheldon>把我的头发从眼前吹开
<2-3,Sheldon>I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.

65
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,130
<2-4,Leonard>谢尔顿  你就是晚了一天没理发而已
<2-4,Leonard>Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.

66
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,690
<2-5,Sheldon>谢谢你  一句话点明了我的恶梦
<2-5,Sheldon>Thank you for captioning my nightmare.

67
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,040
<2-6,Howard>瞧  我收到我的随行指示信了
<2-6,Howard>Lookie here, I got my travel orders.

68
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,200
<2-7,Raj>"随行专家霍华德·沃罗威茨受命
<2-7,Raj>"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested

69
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,630

<2-7,Raj>约翰逊太空中心
<2-7,Raj>Houston, Texas,

71
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,970
<2-7,Raj>于周日早上八点接受宇航员特训"
<2-7,Raj>for astronaut training Monday 8:00 a.m."

72
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,040
<2-8,Howard>不过这是宇航局的信  所以时间得按照军事格式来念
<2-8,Howard>Yeah, but it's from NASA, so it's 0800.

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,540
<2-9,Raj>可上面写的是"早上八点"
<2-9,Raj>But it says "8:00 a.m."

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,440
<2-10,Howard>你得按照军事格式来念"0800"
<2-10,Howard>You read it as "0800."

75
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,030
<2-11,Raj>可它前面没写有"O"啊
<2-11,Raj>It doesn't have an "O" in front of it.

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
<2-12,Howard>你知道哪句话前面有"O[哦]"吗
<2-12,Howard>You know what does have an "oh" in front of it?

77
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,610
<2-12,Howard>"哦  我的天  我现在是宇航员了"
<2-12,Howard>"Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,

78
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,960
<2-12,Howard>"你就羡慕嫉妒恨吧"
<2-12,Howard>and you're dying of jealousy."

79
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,220
<2-13,Leonard>那他们要...
<2-13,Leonard>So, what kind of things are they...?

80
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,770
<2-13,Leonard>你能消停会儿吗
<2-13,Leonard>Will you stop that?

81
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,390
<2-14,Sheldon>我忍不住  感觉自己就像是个少女杀手
<2-14,Sheldon>I can't help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.

82
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,880
<2-15,Penny>谢尔顿  我以前常给我哥剪头发
<2-15,Penny>You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.

83
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,950
<2-15,Penny>我也能帮你的
<2-15,Penny>I could do it for you.

84
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,840
<2-16,Sheldon>佩妮  我知道这是你的一片好心
<2-16,Sheldon>Penny, I know you mean well,

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,880
<2-16,Sheldon>用你们村里的手艺来帮我  不过呢
<2-16,Sheldon>offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um,

86
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,970
<2-16,Sheldon>在我们城里
<2-16,Sheldon>here in town,

87
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,530
<2-16,Sheldon>我们不用搅乳器来搅黄油
<2-16,Sheldon>we don't churn our own butter,

88
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,670
<2-16,Sheldon>我们也不用麻袋来做裙子
<2-16,Sheldon>we don't make dresses out of gunny sacks,

89
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,010
<2-16,Sheldon>我们也很确定不想让一个染黄发的丫头
<2-16,Sheldon>and, uh, we sure as shootin' don't get our hair cut

90
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,010
<2-16,Sheldon>来给自己理发
<2-16,Sheldon>by bottle-blonde...

91
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,670
<2-17,Leonard>谢尔顿  为人要友善
<2-17,Leonard>Sheldon, be nice.

92
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,690
<2-18,Sheldon>不好意思  有个坏小子的发型
<2-18,Sheldon>I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude

93
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,110
<2-18,Sheldon>就有个坏小子的脾气
<2-18,Sheldon>that comes with this hair.

94
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,760
<2-19,Raj>你可以试试我的理发师
<2-19,Raj>You could go to my guy.

95
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,740
<2-19,Raj>他在比弗利山庄[富人区]的著名美发沙龙
<2-19,Raj>He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills.

96
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,920
<2-19,Raj>他们会给你沏茶  会给你按摩头皮
<2-19,Raj>They bring you a cup of tea, they'll massage your scalp.

97
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,790
<2-19,Raj>虽然要两百块  不过没准有时坐在你旁边的
<2-19,Raj>It's about $200, but sometimes you look in the next chair

98
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,920
<2-19,Raj>就是一位超级巨星  比如托尼·丹扎
<2-19,Raj>and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.

99
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,600
<2-20,Howard>快速提问
<2-20,Howard>Quick question here:

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
<2-20,Howard>我们真的已经把话题
<2-20,Howard>Have we actually changed the conversation

101
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,930
<2-20,Howard>从"我要去参加宇航员特训"
<2-20,Howard>from "I'm going to astronaut training"

102
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,000
<2-21,Raj>转到"谢尔顿找不到地方理发"了吗
<2-21,Raj>to "Sheldon can't get a haircut"?

103
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,080
<2-21,Raj>你看现在是谁在羡慕嫉妒恨
<2-21,Raj>Now who's dying of jealousy?

104
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,030
<2-21,Raj>"哦"  是你啊
<2-21,Raj>"Oh," it's you.

105
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,520
<3-1,Amy>* 我是牛仔 *
<3-1,Amy>* I'm a cowboy *

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,690
<3-1,Amy>* 骑着一匹铁马 *
<3-1,Amy>* On a steel horse I ride *

112
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,200
<3-1,Amy>谢尔顿
<3-1,Amy>Sheldon,

113
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,190
<3-1,Amy>你把我们的情侣对唱之夜都给毁了
<3-1,Amy>you're ruining girlfriend- boyfriend sing-along night.

114
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,580
<3-1,Amy>抱歉
<3-1,Amy>I'm sorry.

115
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,650
<3-2,Sheldon>我在找理发店  我的时间不多了
<3-2,Sheldon>I'm looking for a barber and I'm running out of time.

116
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,920
<3-2,Sheldon>1飞秒等于10的-15次方秒
<3-2,Sheldon>1幺米等于10的-24次方米

117
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,830
<3-2,Sheldon>我的头发正以每飞秒
<3-2,Sheldon>My hair is growing at the rate

118
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,920
<3-2,Sheldon>4.6幺米的速度生长着
<3-2,Sheldon>of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond.

119
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,750
<3-2,Sheldon>你要是安静点  还能听见头发生长的声音
<3-2,Sheldon>I mean, if you're quiet, you can hear it.

120
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,450
<3-3,Amy>要不去"超级剪"美发沙龙呢
<3-3,Amy>What about Supercuts?

121
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,470
<3-4,Sheldon>我去过一次
<3-4,Sheldon>I tried once.

122
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,790
<3-4,Sheldon>那里无论男人还是女人
<3-4,Sheldon>They do men's and women's hair

123
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,780
<3-4,Sheldon>都坐在同一个房间里一块剪
<3-4,Sheldon>in the same room at the same time.

124
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,350
<3-4,Sheldon>那简直就像是带有摩丝的罪恶之城
<3-4,Sheldon>It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.

125
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,630
<3-5,Amy>这件事没那么严重
<3-5,Amy>Well, this isn't a crisis.

126
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,060
<3-5,Amy>何不干脆让头发长长点算了
<3-5,Amy>Why don't you just let your hair grow out a little?

127
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,060
<3-6,Sheldon>何不干脆让头发长长
<3-6,Sheldon>Why don't I let my hair grow out?

128
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,730
<3-6,Sheldon>那我何不干脆开始穿凉鞋
<3-6,Sheldon>Um, why don't I start wearing Birkenstocks

129
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,830
<3-6,Sheldon>并用"你喜欢不"这句话
<3-6,Sheldon>and seeking validation of my opinions by asking

130
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,440
<3-6,Sheldon>来求证我的选择
<3-6,Sheldon>"Can you dig it?"

131
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,890
<3-6,Sheldon>我不知道啊
<3-6,Sheldon>Well, I don't know.

132
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,340
<3-7,Amy>我是觉得你留长头发挺性感的
<3-7,Amy>I think you might look sexy with long hair.

133
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,110
<3-7,Amy>就留那种齐肩长发
<3-7,Amy>The kind that flows down to your shoulders

134
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,390
<3-7,Amy>骑马的时候还能随风飘动
<3-7,Amy>and blows back while riding on a horse.

135
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,230
<3-7,Amy>马背光溜溜  你胸光溜溜
<3-7,Amy>Bareback and bare-chested.

137
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,450
<3-7,Amy>我要去"刷牙"了  估计得刷一会儿
<3-7,Amy>I'm gonna go brush my teeth; it might take a while.

138
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,030
<4-2,Bernadette>宝贝儿
<4-2,Bernadette>Hi, sweetie.

139
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,980
<4-3,Howard>我想你
<4-3,Howard>I miss you.

140
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,680
<4-4,Bernadette>我也想你了
<4-4,Bernadette>I miss you, too.

141
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,150
<4-4,Bernadette>你第一天过得怎么样
<4-4,Bernadette>So tell me all about your first day.

142
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,720
<4-5,Howard>我该从哪讲起呢
<4-5,Howard>Oh, wow, where do I even start?

143
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,020
<4-5,Howard>我体验了零重力
<4-5,Howard>I got to experience zero gravity.

144
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,640
<4-6,Bernadette>酷  他们怎么做到的
<4-6,Bernadette>Cool. How do they do that?

145
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,460
<4-7,Howard>还挺简单的
<4-7,Howard>It's pretty neat.

146
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,660
<4-7,Howard>你坐进飞机
<4-7,Howard>You get in this plane

147
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,600
<4-7,Howard>然后垂直上升  历时大概二十秒左右
<4-7,Howard>that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds,

148
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,270
<4-7,Howard>然后再跟要坠机一样  垂直下落
<4-7,Howard>and then straight back down like it's going to crash, and

149
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,660
<4-7,Howard>如此循环往复
<4-7,Howard>they do it over and over again, you know,

150
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,560
<4-7,Howard>吐到连胆汁都快出来了也没人管
<4-7,Howard>no matter how many times you throw up.

151
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,480
<4-8,Bernadette>你吐了吗
<4-8,Bernadette>You threw up?

152
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,740
<4-9,Howard>是啊  而且最变态的是
<4-9,Howard>Yeah...and the craziest part is,

153
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,290
<4-9,Howard>因为是零重力环境
<4-9,Howard>because there's no gravity,

154
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,290
<4-9,Howard>呕吐物就浮在空中
<4-9,Howard>the throw-up kind of floats there...

155
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,590
<4-9,Howard>呈一个球状
<4-9,Howard>in a little ball,

156
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,890
<4-9,Howard>如果你吓得大叫
<4-9,Howard>and if your mouth is open

157
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,840
<4-9,Howard>嘴巴张开的话
<4-9,Howard>because you're screaming...

158
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,800
<4-9,Howard>有时呕吐物就会再飘回你嘴里
<4-9,Howard>...sometimes it just floats right back in.

159
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,470
<4-9,Howard>天啊  到时候你就沦为大家的笑柄
<4-9,Howard>Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.

160
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,230
<4-10,Bernadette>他们听起来好坏哦
<4-10,Bernadette>That sounds mean.

161
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,390
<4-10,Bernadette>没有
<4-10,Bernadette>No.

162
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,000
<4-11,Howard>其实我当时也想笑的
<4-11,Howard>Yeah, I would have laughed, too,

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,220
<4-11,Howard>只不过我不想让呕吐物二次飘回我的嘴里
<4-11,Howard>but I didn't want the vomit to come back out.

164
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,330
<4-11,Howard>总而言之
<4-11,Howard>Anyway...

165
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,060
<4-11,Howard>对了  你能不能帮我
<4-11,Howard>Oh, could you do me a favor

166
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,170
<4-11,Howard>连夜快递几条内裤过来
<4-11,Howard>and overnight me some more underwear?

167
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,350
<4-12,Bernadette>没问题  怎么了
<4-12,Bernadette>Sure, why?

168
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,000
<4-13,Howard>今天看了一眼那台离心机
<4-13,Howard>I got a look at the centrifuge

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,650
<4-13,Howard>明天我要在里面进行高速旋转训练
<4-13,Howard>they're going to spin me around in tomorrow,

170
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,470
<4-13,Howard>于是我隐约感觉到我带的内裤不够
<4-13,Howard>and I have a hunch I packed a little light.

171
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,660
<4-13,Howard>诺费奥先生
<4-13,Howard>Mr. D'Onofrio?

172
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,380
<4-13,Howard>是我  谢尔顿
<4-13,Howard>It's me, Sheldon.

173
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,250
<5-1,Sheldon>礼品店里没有任何和理发相关的礼物
<5-1,Sheldon>They didn't have anything barber-themed in the gift shop,

174
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,150
<5-1,Sheldon>所以我给你买了这个
<5-1,Sheldon>so I got you this.

175
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,140
<5-1,Sheldon>不知道您能不能看见他T恤上的小字
<5-1,Sheldon>I don't know if you can read his little T-shirt.

176
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,250
<5-1,Sheldon>上面写着  快点"熊"起来哦
<5-1,Sheldon>It says, um, "Get well bear-y soon."

177
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,950
<5-1,Sheldon>相信我  如果现在您稍微有点意识
<5-1,Sheldon>Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now,

178
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,190
<5-1,Sheldon>肯定也会发笑的
<5-1,Sheldon>you'd be laughing.

179
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,770
<5-1,Sheldon>总而言之
<5-1,Sheldon>Anyway...

180
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,200
<5-1,Sheldon>有一项新的研究表明  昏迷中的人
<5-1,Sheldon>There's new studies that show, people in comas

181
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,020
<5-1,Sheldon>也能感知到身边发生的一切
<5-1,Sheldon>are aware of everything going on around them.

182
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,110
<5-1,Sheldon>所以说  如果您现在能听到我说话
<5-1,Sheldon>With that in mind, if you can hear me,

183
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,060
<5-1,Sheldon>请离开您的病床
<5-1,Sheldon>move away from the light

184
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,080
<5-1,Sheldon>跟着这把剪刀的声音走
<5-1,Sheldon>and toward the sound of these scissors.

185
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,640
<5-2,Nurse>有什么可以帮到你吗
<5-2,Nurse>Can I help you?

186
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,040
<5-2,Nurse>是的
<5-2,Nurse>Yes.

187
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,680
<5-3,Sheldon>你这里有类似理发店大围布的东西吗
<5-3,Sheldon>Do you have something I could use as a cape?

188
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,710
<5-4,Nurse>天啊  你是不是把药给吐了
<5-4,Nurse>Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,

189
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,920
<5-4,Nurse>然后从九楼[精神病科]偷溜出来
<5-4,Nurse>slip out of the ninth floor,

190
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,840
<5-4,Nurse>跑到这探险来了
<5-4,Nurse>and go on a little adventure?

191
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,500
<5-5,Sheldon>不  不
<5-5,Sheldon>Oh, no, no,

192
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,010
<5-5,Sheldon>我只是来找他理发的
<5-5,Sheldon>I'm just here to get my hair cut.

193
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,060
<5-6,Nurse>我明白了
<5-6,Nurse>I-I see.

194
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,350
<5-6,Nurse>你在这等一下
<5-6,Nurse>J-Jus-Just wait here one moment.

195
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,260
<5-6,Nurse>保安
<5-6,Nurse>Security!

196
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,210
<5-7,Sheldon>我得跑了
<5-7,Sheldon>I got to run.

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,530
<5-7,Sheldon>但是不能拿着剪刀  那样太不安全了
<5-7,Sheldon>But not with scissors -- that would be unsafe.

198
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,120
<6-1,Penny>要是我把我的小马挪到这来
<6-1,Penny>So, if I move my horsey here...

199
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,960
<6-1,Penny>是不是就将军了  我是赢了吧
<6-1,Penny>...isn't that checkmate and I win?

200
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,390
<6-3,Penny>到底是不是我赢了
<6-3,Penny>Well, is it or isn't it?

201
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,870
<6-4,Leonard>我们今天就下到这吧
<6-4,Leonard>You know, I think this is a good stopping point.

202
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,130
<6-4,Leonard>你第一次下象棋
<6-4,Leonard>Uh, it's your first real game.

203
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,890
<6-4,Leonard>有太多知识要消化了
<6-4,Leonard>I threw a lot of information at you.

204
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,190
<6-5,Penny>不
<6-5,Penny>Well, no,

205
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,590
<6-5,Penny>你的国王被我困住了
<6-5,Penny>I mean, your king is trapped.

206
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,160
<6-5,Penny>他不能往这走  因为我在这摆了个灯塔[车]
<6-5,Penny>He can't go here because of my lighthouse,

207
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,340
<6-5,Penny>还有
<6-5,Penny>and...

208
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,530
<6-5,Penny>他也不能往这走  因为我在这摆了一个尖头小人[象]
<6-5,Penny>he can't go here because of my pointy-head guy.

209
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,400
<6-6,Leonard>正如我说的  这个游戏很复杂
<6-6,Leonard>Like I said, complicated game.

210
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,120
<6-7,Penny>那我到底赢没赢
<6-7,Penny>So did I win or not?

211
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,330
<6-8,Leonard>你玩得开心吗
<6-8,Leonard>Did you have fun?

212
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,300
<6-8,Leonard>因为只要你玩得开心了  就算是赢了
<6-8,Leonard>Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner.

213
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,380
<6-8,Leonard>象棋就是这样
<6-8,Leonard>That's, that-that's what chess is all about.

214
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,930
<6-11,Penny>-抱歉  谢尔顿  我这就挪开  -何必呢
<6-11,Penny>- Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.  - Eh, why?

215
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,070
<6-12,Sheldon>我的位置  你的位置  有区别吗
<6-12,Sheldon>My spot, your spot-- what difference does it make?

216
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,440
<6-13,Penny>好吧  刚刚发生了什么
<6-13,Penny>Okay, what just happened?

217
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,910
<6-13,Penny>我不知道
<6-13,Penny>I don't know.

218
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,210
<6-14,Leonard>一会是你的象棋技术堪比世界冠军
<6-14,Leonard>Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer

219
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,960
<6-14,Leonard>一会是谢尔顿不介意你坐了他的位置
<6-14,Leonard>and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot,

220
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,500
<6-14,Leonard>我估计是有人穿越回去  踩死了只虫子[蝴蝶效应]
<6-14,Leonard>I'm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug,

221
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,690
<6-14,Leonard>改变了人类的历史进程吧
<6-14,Leonard>and changed the course of human events.

222
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,100
<6-15,Penny>亲爱的  你没事吧
<6-15,Penny>Uh, sweetie, are you all right?

223
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,470
<6-16,Sheldon>不  我有事
<6-16,Sheldon>No, I'm not all right.

224
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,630
<6-16,Sheldon>我本来六天前就该剪头发了
<6-16,Sheldon>It's been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut

225
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,690
<6-16,Sheldon>除此之外  无大事发生
<6-16,Sheldon>and nothing horrible has happened.

226
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,920
<6-17,Penny>不好意思  我不懂
<6-17,Penny>Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

227
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,830
<6-18,Sheldon>莱纳德  给她解释下
<6-18,Sheldon>Leonard, explain it to her.

228
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,020
<6-19,Leonard>那个  他疯了
<6-19,Leonard>Oh, uh, he's crazy.

229
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,070
<6-20,Sheldon>我用了一生时间
<6-20,Sheldon>I have spent my whole life

230
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,730
<6-20,Sheldon>精心安排我每天该做什么
<6-20,Sheldon>trying to bring order to the universe

231
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,530
<6-20,Sheldon>就是想要给这个世界带来秩序
<6-20,Sheldon>by carefully planning every moment of every day.

232
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,780
<6-20,Sheldon>而我所有的努力
<6-20,Sheldon>But all my efforts--

233
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,400
<6-20,Sheldon>我的晚餐安排  我的睡衣轮换制
<6-20,Sheldon>our dinner schedule, my pajama rotation,

234
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,240
<6-20,Sheldon>我的排便情况试算表
<6-20,Sheldon>my bowel movement spreadsheet--

235
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,140
<6-20,Sheldon>现在我算明白了
<6-20,Sheldon>it's clear now,

236
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,570
<6-20,Sheldon>我一直在浪费时间
<6-20,Sheldon>I've been wasting my time.

237
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,020
<6-21,Leonard>很好  我要把那恶心的表格从冰箱上拿下来
<6-21,Leonard>Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.

238
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,760
<6-22,Penny>听我说  谢尔顿
<6-22,Penny>You know, Sh-Sheldon,

239
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,830
<6-22,Penny>有时未来不可预知也挺好的
<6-22,Penny>sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming.

240
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,990
<6-22,Penny>我是说  看我和莱纳德
<6-22,Penny>I mean, look at me and Leonard.

241
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,020
<6-22,Penny>我们约会  分手  现在又试着复合
<6-22,Penny>We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again.

242
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,300
<6-22,Penny>我们也不知道未来会怎么样
<6-22,Penny>We don't know what's gonna happen.

243
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,860
<6-23,Sheldon>得了吧  你们会怎么样大家都心知肚明
<6-23,Sheldon>Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen.

244
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,120
<6-23,Sheldon>但我懂你们的意思
<6-23,Sheldon>But I see your point.

245
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,570
<6-24,Leonard>我觉得这样对你挺好
<6-24,Leonard>I think this could be good for you.

246
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,180
<6-24,Leonard>也许你是该有所改变了
<6-24,Leonard>Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit.

247
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,360
<6-24,Leonard>你说的没错
<6-24,Leonard>You're right.

248
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,920
<6-25,Sheldon>我应该接受无序的世界
<6-25,Sheldon>I should embrace the chaos.

249
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,620
<6-26,Leonard>很好
<6-26,Leonard>Great.

250
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,830
<6-26,Leonard>那你先要做什么
<6-26,Leonard>What are you going to do first?

251
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,950
<6-26,Leonard>我不知道
<6-26,Leonard>I don't know.

252
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,480
<6-27,Sheldon>我什么都可以做
<6-27,Sheldon>I could do anything.

253
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,110
<6-27,Sheldon>原来的规则通通丢掉
<6-27,Sheldon>All bets are off.

255
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,770
<6-27,Sheldon>世界由我主宰
<6-27,Sheldon>The world is my oyster.

256
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,590
<6-27,Sheldon>我知道了
<6-27,Sheldon>I got it.

257
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,780
<6-27,Sheldon>我今晚要穿我星期二的睡衣
<6-27,Sheldon>I'm going to put on my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

258
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,970
<6-28,Leonard>我得说  我有点担心他
<6-28,Leonard>I got to tell you, I'm a little worried about him.

259
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,540
<6-29,Penny>如果我是你  我会更担心刚有一个
<6-29,Penny>If I were you, I'd be worried that a girl

260
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,380
<6-29,Penny>从没下过象棋的女生  让你输得落花流水这个事实
<6-29,Penny>who's never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.

261
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,390
<7-2,Bernadette>华仔  你怎么了
<7-2,Bernadette>Howie, what happened to you?

262
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,270
<7-3,Howard>我们通宵在野外进行生存训练
<7-3,Howard>We did overnight survival training in the wilderness.

263
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,270
<7-3,Howard>好玩
<7-3,Howard>Big fun.

264
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,060
<7-3,Howard>超级好玩
<7-3,Howard>Big, big fun.

265
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,540
<7-3,Howard>我本想在跟你视频之前洗把脸
<7-3,Howard>I was gonna freshen up for you

266
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,410
<7-3,Howard>但我在去洗手间的路上  晕过去了一小会儿
<7-3,Howard>but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.

267
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,890
<7-4,Bernadette>生存训练
<7-4,Bernadette>Survival training?

268
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,050
<7-4,Bernadette>就像露营那样吗
<7-4,Bernadette>Is that like camping?

269
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,090
<7-5,Howard>对啊
<7-5,Howard>Uh-huh.

270
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,520
<7-5,Howard>除了没有食物和水
<7-5,Howard>Except you don't have food or water,

271
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,850
<7-5,Howard>也不像汉斯·克拉默营那样的
<7-5,Howard>and they don't have a sunset Sabbath service

272
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,130
<7-5,Howard>日出而作  日落而息
<7-5,Howard>like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.

273
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,960
<7-6,Bernadette>你是在帐篷里睡吗
<7-6,Bernadette>Do you sleep in tents?

274
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,080
<7-6,Bernadette>不是
<7-6,Bernadette>No.

275
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,240
<7-7,Howard>我睡在一个洞里
<7-7,Howard>I slept in a hole

276
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,540
<7-7,Howard>还是我徒手挖的洞
<7-7,Howard>I dug in the ground with my bare hands.

277
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,270
<7-7,Howard>而且晚上的时候
<7-7,Howard>And at some point during the night,

278
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,850
<7-7,Howard>一只穿山甲爬了进来
<7-7,Howard>an armadillo crawled in

279
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,350
<7-7,Howard>还给了我爱的抱抱
<7-7,Howard>and spooned me.

280
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,190
<7-8,Bernadette>可怜的孩子
<7-8,Bernadette>Poor baby.

281
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,280
<7-9,Howard>但我做到了
<7-9,Howard>But I did it.

282
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,730
<7-9,Howard>我活下来了
<7-9,Howard>I survived.

283
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,650
<7-9,Howard>我不知道沙尘暴来时该往哪儿躲
<7-9,Howard>I wasn't sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit.

284
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,940
<7-9,Howard>我只能拉起高领毛衣盖着头
<7-9,Howard>I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head

285
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,680
<7-9,Howard>呆那儿等死
<7-9,Howard>and waited for death.

286
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,740
<7-9,Howard>但当我坐在那的时候
<7-9,Howard>But somehow as I sat there,

287
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,410
<7-9,Howard>裹在满是汗味的衣茧里
<7-9,Howard>wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat,

288
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,640
<7-9,Howard>我发现了人类精神的真谛
<7-9,Howard>I found that primal part of the human spirit

289
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,640
<7-9,Howard>就是要活下去
<7-9,Howard>that just wants to keep on living,

290
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,810
<7-9,Howard>无论付出什么代价
<7-9,Howard>no matter what the cost.

291
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,650
<7-10,Bernadette>你太勇敢了
<7-10,Bernadette>You're so brave.

292
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,990
<7-10,Bernadette>我为你自豪
<7-10,Bernadette>I'm proud of you.

293
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,590
<7-11,Howard>我吃了只蝴蝶
<7-11,Howard>I ate a butterfly.

294
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,060
<7-11,Howard>那只蝴蝶好小
<7-11,Howard>It was so small

295
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,530
<7-11,Howard>也很美
<7-11,Howard>and...  beautiful,

296
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,870
<7-11,Howard>但我好饿
<7-11,Howard>but I was so hungry.

297
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,000
<7-12,Bernadette>你在哭吗
<7-12,Bernadette>Are you crying?

298
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,900
<7-13,Howard>不  我觉得这不可能
<7-13,Howard>No, I don't think it's possible.

299
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,400
<7-13,Howard>我已经严重脱水了
<7-13,Howard>I'm severely dehydrated.

300
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,960
<7-13,Howard>我的尿就跟牙膏一样稠
<7-13,Howard>My pee is like toothpaste.

301
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,920
<7-14,Bernadette>华仔  如果你坚持不住  就回家吧
<7-14,Bernadette>Howie, if you're not able to do this, come home.

302
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,400
<7-14,Bernadette>我对你的感觉不会变的
<7-14,Bernadette>It won't change how I feel about you.

303
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,800
<7-15,Howard>谢了  亲爱的  但我不能放弃
<7-15,Howard>Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.

304
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,930
<7-15,Howard>不然的话  我就是一个
<7-15,Howard>If I do, I'll just be a guy

305
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,110
<7-15,Howard>有机会成为宇航员  却中途放弃的人
<7-15,Howard>who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.

306
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,400
<7-16,Bernadette>那我能为你做什么吗
<7-16,Bernadette>Well, is there anything I could do to help?

307
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,790
<7-16,Bernadette>没有
<7-16,Bernadette>No.

308
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,160
<7-17,Howard>等等  再多寄点内裤来
<7-17,Howard>Wait. Send more underwear.

<8-1,Leonard (going to living room)>千万别是谢尔顿在打小手鼓
<8-1,Leonard (going to living room)>Don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.

<8-2,Sheldon>但我想呀  你没猜到我有小手鼓吧
<8-2,Sheldon>Bet you didn't know that I had bongos.

<8-6,Sheldon>莱纳德在睡觉  而我在打小手鼓
<8-6,Sheldon>Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.

<8-11,Leonard>佩妮  你猜怎么着
<8-11,Leonard>Penny, guess what?

325
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,870
<8-11,Leonard>谢尔顿有对小手鼓
<8-11,Leonard>Sheldon got bongos.

326
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,830
<8-12,Penny>为什么你会有小手鼓
<8-12,Penny>Why did you get bongos?

327
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,520
<8-13,Sheldon>理查德·费曼会打小手鼓
<8-13,Sheldon>Richard Feynman played the bongos.

328
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,110
<8-13,Sheldon>我就想说我也该试试
<8-13,Sheldon>I thought I'd give that a try.

329
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,040
<8-14,Leonard>理查德·费曼是位著名物理学家
<8-14,Leonard>Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.

<8-15,Penny>我才不管理查德·费曼
<8-15,Penny>I don't care if Richard Feynman

332
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,710
<8-15,Penny>是不是我屁股里住着的紫色妖精呢
<8-15,Penny>was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.

333
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,770
<8-16,Sheldon>佩妮是假设费曼是紫色妖精
<8-16,Sheldon>Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun.

334
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,970
<8-16,Sheldon>佩妮忘记要用虚拟语气了
<8-16,Sheldon>Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.

<8-18,Sheldon>Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.

345
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,230
<8-20,Sheldon>我们生活在一个无序的世界
<8-20,Sheldon>We are living in a world of chaos.

<8-22,Sheldon>千万不要  边打小手鼓边下楼梯
<8-22,Sheldon>Never play bongos walking down the stairs.

<10-1,Amy>昨晚半夜他带着小手鼓出现
<10-1,Amy>He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos.

362
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,500
<10-1,Amy>我错误以为这是某种音乐求欢方式
<10-1,Amy>I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.

363
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,460
<10-2,Leonard>可怜的家伙
<10-2,Leonard>Poor guy.

364

<10-2,Leonard>谢尔顿想睡着呀  而莱纳德在打小手鼓呀
<10-2,Leonard>Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
