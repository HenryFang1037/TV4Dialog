6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,010
<1-1,Sheldon>旗帜学的奇妙世界
<1-1,Sheldon>the dynamic world of vexillology.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,200
<1-2,Amy>等一下  库博士
<1-2,Amy>Hang on, Dr. C.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,020
<1-2,Amy>旗帜学是什么
<1-2,Amy>What's vexillology?

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,030
<1-3,Sheldon>旗帜学就是研究旗帜的
<1-3,Sheldon>Vexillology is the study of flags.

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,070
<1-4,Amy>真棒
<1-4,Amy>Cool.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,410
<1-4,Amy>我想我又长见识了
<1-4,Amy>I think I just learned something.

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,830
<1-5,Sheldon>-你觉得有趣吗  -当然
<1-5,Sheldon>- Did you have fun doing it? - I'll say.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,550
<1-6,Amy>这个节目具有两面性  趣味性和知识性
<1-6,Amy>Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast,

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,680
<1-7,Sheldon>就如同这面两面的州旗
<1-7,Sheldon>not unlike the only two-sided state flag--

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,300
<1-7,Sheldon>一面是俄勒冈洲
<1-7,Sheldon>Oregon.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,740
<1-7,Sheldon>俄勒冈州该州以喜栖息于水边挖穴而居的海狸作为象征
<1-7,Sheldon>故有海狸州的别称

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,990
<1-7,Sheldon>瞧
<1-7,Sheldon>Oh, look.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,740
<1-7,Sheldon>你好  海狸先生
<1-7,Sheldon>Hello, Mr. Beaver.

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,820
<1-7,Sheldon>在接下来的节目里  我们会回答一些热门问题
<1-7,Sheldon>In future episodes, we'll answer some burning questions:

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,360
<1-7,Sheldon>唯一一面不是长方形的旗帜是什么
<1-7,Sheldon>What's the only non-rectangular flag?

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,910
<1-7,Sheldon>在旗帜上出现最多的动物是什么
<1-7,Sheldon>What animal appears most often on flags?

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,010
<1-7,Sheldon>在旗帜上出现第二多的动物是什么
<1-7,Sheldon>What animal appears second most often on flags?

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,930
<1-7,Sheldon>等等
<1-7,Sheldon>And more.

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,800
<1-8,Amy>太棒了
<1-8,Amy>Sweet!

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,280
<1-9,Sheldon>你为什么挥白旗
<1-9,Sheldon>Why are you waving a white flag?

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,580
<1-10,Amy>因为太欢乐了
<1-10,Amy>I'm surrendering...

27
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,230
<1-10,Amy>我投降了
<1-10,Amy>to fun.

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,360
<1-11,Sheldon>今天《有趣的旗帜》的内容并不有趣
<1-11,Sheldon>Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags is not fun,

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,730
<1-11,Sheldon>但十分重要
<1-11,Sheldon>but it is important.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
<1-11,Sheldon>旗帜第一课  要学会如何拿
<1-11,Sheldon>"Flags: you gotta know how to hold 'em,

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,380
<1-11,Sheldon>如何叠
<1-11,Sheldon>you gotta know how to fold 'em."

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,430
<1-11,Sheldon>那我们先开始认识旗帜的结构
<1-11,Sheldon>Let's start by identifying the parts of our flag.

33
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,590
<1-11,Sheldon>这边是吊孔  用来...
<1-11,Sheldon>This edge is the hoist, and it's used to...

34
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,910
<1-12,Leonard>抱歉  借过一下
<1-12,Leonard>Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,100
<1-12,Leonard>停
<1-12,Leonard>Cut.

36
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,710
<1-13,Sheldon>你没看到我们在拍吗
<1-13,Sheldon>Did you not see we are rolling?

37
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,980
<1-14,Leonard>抱歉  我要和佩妮一起吃晚饭
<1-14,Leonard>Sorry. I'm having dinner with Penny.

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,180
<1-15,Sheldon>我得赶紧出门
<1-15,Sheldon>I have to get out of here.

39
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,930
<1-15,Sheldon>而我满脑子的旗帜知识
<1-15,Sheldon>And I have flag knowledge

40
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,670
<1-15,Sheldon>我也得让它们赶紧出来
<1-15,Sheldon>that I have to get out of here!

41
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,350
<1-16,Amy>你没事吧
<1-16,Amy>You okay?

42
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,380
<1-17,Sheldon>没事  就是有点生气
<1-17,Sheldon>No, I'm a little rattled.

44
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,520
<1-17,Sheldon>但就像萨姆特要塞的旗帜  我还坚守着呢
<1-17,Sheldon>But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I'm still here.

45
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,160
<1-17,Sheldon>第二遍
<1-17,Sheldon>And... take two.

46
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,120
<1-14,Leonard>大家好
<1-14,Leonard>Hello.

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,930
<1-6,Amy>《有趣的旗帜》之首播集
<1-6,Amy>of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,530
<1-4,Amy>在接下来的五十二周  我们将一起探索
<1-4,Amy>Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore

51
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,000
<1-1,Sheldon>旗帜学的奇妙世界
<1-1,Sheldon>the dynamic world of vexillology.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,210
<1-2,Amy>等一下  库珀博士
<1-2,Amy>Hang on, Dr. Cooper.

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,220
<1-2,Amy>旗帜学是什么
<1-2,Amy>What's vexillology?

54
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,160
<1-3,Sheldon>旗帜学就是...
<1-3,Sheldon>Vexillology is...

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,110
<1-19,Sheldon>为什么旗帜上有张脸
<1-19,Sheldon>Why is there a face on that flag?

56
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,330
<1-20,Amy>他叫斐迪南·T·旗帜
<1-20,Amy>It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

57
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,800
<1-20,Amy>我觉得他能吸引少儿观众群
<1-20,Amy>I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,320
<1-21,Sheldon>真讨厌  不过没错  这主意妙
<1-21,Sheldon>Confound it! You're right, it's brilliant.

59
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,980
<1-21,Sheldon>我们从头开始录吧
<1-21,Sheldon>Let's take it from the top.

69
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,980
<2-1,Penny>晚饭真不错
<2-1,Penny>That was a really nice dinner.

70
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,540
<2-1,Penny>我很开心你又约我出去了
<2-1,Penny>I'm glad you asked me out again.

71
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,550
<2-2,Leonard>我也是  我很想你
<2-2,Leonard>Me, too; I missed you.

72
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,990
<2-3,Penny>你天天都能看到我
<2-3,Penny>You see me all the time.

73
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,220
<2-3,Penny>你确定你想的不是滚床单的部分吗
<2-3,Penny>You sure you just don't miss the sex?

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,980
<2-4,Leonard>好吧  和你滚床单的感觉是很棒
<2-4,Leonard>Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great.

75
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,530
<2-4,Leonard>你试过吗
<2-4,Leonard>Have you ever tried it?

76
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,570
<2-5,Penny>试过  你说的没错
<2-5,Penny>I have. You are not wrong.

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,500
<2-5,Penny>我只是觉得  如果我们要复合的话
<2-5,Penny>I just think if we're gonna try dating again,

78
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,860
<2-5,Penny>应该慢慢来
<2-5,Penny>we should take things slow.

79
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,210
<2-6,Leonard>我可以慢慢来啊
<2-6,Leonard>Oh, I can take it slow.

80
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,630
<2-6,Leonard>我有和你说过我高中时的第一任女友
<2-6,Leonard>Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school,

81
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,200
<2-6,Leonard>凯伦·波布瑞克吗
<2-6,Leonard>Karen Berberick?

82
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,690
<2-6,Leonard>至今她都不知道当时我们是在约会
<2-6,Leonard>To this day she doesn't know we were going out.

83
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,380
<2-6,Leonard>不过这么一来  分手的时候就容易多了
<2-6,Leonard>Made it easier on her when I broke things off.

84
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,590
<2-7,Penny>好吧  也不要那么慢
<2-7,Penny>Okay, well, maybe not that slow.

85
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,030
<2-8,Leonard>那这样吧
<2-8,Leonard>How about this,

86
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,500
<2-8,Leonard>你知道电脑软件通常是怎么开发的吗
<2-8,Leonard>are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?

87
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,180
<2-9,Penny>为了好玩  就当我不知道好了
<2-9,Penny>You know, just for fun, let's say I'm not.

88
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,130
<2-10,Leonard>在一款应用程序发布之前
<2-10,Leonard>Before an application is released,

89
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,690
<2-10,Leonard>都会先进行测试
<2-10,Leonard>they give it a trial run.

90
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,170
<2-10,Leonard>我们可以这么做
<2-10,Leonard>W-We could do that.

91
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,250
<2-10,Leonard>如果我们遇到分歧  不要生气
<2-10,Leonard>And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad,

92
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,210
<2-10,Leonard>就当是发现了个问题
<2-10,Leonard>just say, "Hey, we found a bug,"

93
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,350
<2-10,Leonard>把问题报告出来  然后修复
<2-10,Leonard>and we report it so it can be fixed.

94
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,070
<2-11,Penny>是像公开测试那种吗
<2-11,Penny>You mean like a beta test?

95
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,140
<2-12,Leonard>严格上来说  这是内部测试
<2-12,Leonard>Well, technically, this would be an alpha test.

96
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,480
<2-12,Leonard>公开测试是给没参与
<2-12,Leonard>A beta test requires people that weren't involved

97
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,460
<2-12,Leonard>程序开发的无关人士...
<2-12,Leonard>in the development of the appli...

98
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,400
<2-13,Penny>我好歹知道"公开测试"  不该表扬一下吗
<2-13,Penny>Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?

99
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,950
<2-14,Leonard>当然
<2-14,Leonard>No, you should.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,850
<2-14,Leonard>当然了  是我在卖弄学问
<2-14,Leonard>Absolutely. That was me being pedantic.

101
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,070
<2-14,Leonard>这是我们的第一个问题
<2-14,Leonard>That's our first bug.

102
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,500
<2-14,Leonard>你报告了
<2-14,Leonard>You reported it.

103
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,490
<2-14,Leonard>我修复了
<2-14,Leonard>I can fix that.

104
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,040
<2-14,Leonard>看见吗  这样不错
<2-14,Leonard>See? This is good.

105
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,480
<2-15,Penny>好吧  那我们就试试
<2-15,Penny>All right. Let's give it a shot.

106
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,280
<2-16,Leonard>很好  咱俩都列个单子记录
<2-16,Leonard>Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list.

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
<2-16,Leonard>到时候再交换
<2-16,Leonard>At some point, we'll exchange.

108
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,630
<2-16,Leonard>好
<2-16,Leonard>Okay.

109
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,100
<2-17,Penny>-晚安  莱纳德  -晚安
<2-17,Penny>- Good night, Leonard. - Night.

110
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,220
<2-18,Leonard>干得好  霍夫斯塔德
<2-18,Leonard>Attaboy, Hofstadter.

111
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,740
<2-18,Leonard>没什么比喻能比软件开发
<2-18,Leonard>Nothing gets the ladies hotter

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,160
<2-18,Leonard>更能让女人兴奋
<2-18,Leonard>than software development analogies.

113
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,320
<2-18,Leonard>我回来了
<2-18,Leonard>Hey, I'm back.

114
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,050
<2-19,Sheldon>停
<2-19,Sheldon>Cut.

115
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
<2-19,Sheldon>第四十七遍
<2-19,Sheldon>Take 47.

116
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,900
<3-1,Sheldon>告诉你一件旗帜的趣事
<3-1,Sheldon>Here's an interesting fact about flags.

117
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,380
<3-2,Raj>我就当你自动开录了
<3-2,Raj>I will take that action.

118
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,490
<3-3,Sheldon>列支敦斯登和海地的国旗
<3-3,Sheldon>The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti

119
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,530
<3-3,Sheldon>以前碰巧是一样的
<3-3,Sheldon>were identical by coincidence,

120
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,920
<3-3,Sheldon>直到两国在1936年奥运会对战时
<3-3,Sheldon>a fact that wasn't discovered until they competed

121
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,660
<3-3,Sheldon>才发现这个巧合
<3-3,Sheldon>against each other at the 1936 Olympics.

122
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,480
<3-3,Sheldon>1936年西班牙人民开始反法西斯斗争
<3-3,Sheldon>其内战被称为"小二战"

123
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,800
<3-3,Sheldon>不过幸好  当时西班牙内战拯救了
<3-3,Sheldon>And thankfully,their embarrassment was overshadowed

124
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,480
<3-3,Sheldon>让两国的尴尬
<3-3,Sheldon>by the rise of Fascism.

125
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,210
<3-4,Howard>看看你的新手机
<3-4,Howard>Let's see the new phone.

126
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,250
<3-5,Raj>我在上班路上买的
<3-5,Raj>I stopped on the way to work.

127
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,260
<3-5,Raj>你要不要跟我一起揭开贴膜
<3-5,Raj>Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?

128
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,170
<3-6,Howard>我何德何能呀
<3-6,Howard>Really? Me?

129
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,350
<3-6,Howard>这可是最棒那部分呀
<3-6,Howard>That's, like, the best part.

130
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,730
<3-7,Raj>从边上揭吧
<3-7,Raj>Grab a corner.

131
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,790

00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,670
<7-8,Leonard>好的

<7-9,Penny>Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren't so tall.

288
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,830
<7-9,Penny>这样你就不会觉得
<7-9,Penny>We wouldn't want you to feel like you were

289

<7-12,Leonard>接吻的时候  我当然能安静点
<7-12,Leonard>I certainly can be quieter when we kiss.

294
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,630
<7-12,Leonard>我原以为这是热情的表示
<7-12,Leonard>I thought it was an expression of passion,

295
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,470
<7-12,Leonard>但是如果被形容为"很湿很奇怪"
<7-12,Leonard>but if it's coming across as "juicy and weird,"

296
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,090
<7-12,Leonard>我宁愿作罢
<7-12,Leonard>who wants that?

<7-12,Leonard>不用了  看见了
<7-12,Leonard>No, never mind. It's right here.

<8-5,Raj>Oh, an exotic little treat.

306
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,400
<8-5,Raj>我正在跟Siri谈北京烤鸭
<8-5,Raj>I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck,

307
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,760
<8-5,Raj>她说她知道四家中国食品店
<8-5,Raj>and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers,

308
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,470
<8-5,Raj>其中两家离这很近
<8-5,Raj>two of which were fairly close to me.

309
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,910
<8-5,Raj>我被她自发性的语音功能传染了
<8-5,Raj>Her spontaneity is contagious.

310
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,190
<8-5,Raj>Siri是谁啊
<8-5,Raj>Who's Siri?

312
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,080
<8-7,Howard>是啊  他手机嘛
<8-7,Howard>Yes. His phone.

313
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,520
<8-8,Bernadette>这该算是可爱还是可怕啊
<8-8,Bernadette>Is that cute or creepy?

314
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,660
<8-10,Raj>我给你们倒点酒吧
<8-10,Raj>Can I pour you some wine?

315
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,490
<8-10,Raj>你们会喜欢的
<8-10,Raj>I think you'll enjoy it.

316
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,100
<8-10,Raj>一般来说  北京烤鸭是佐以
<8-10,Raj>The traditional choice with Peking duck

317
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,290
<8-10,Raj>长相思葡萄酒而食
<8-10,Raj>is a sauvignon blanc,

319
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,950
<8-10,Raj>但Siri建议我采用非干型威士莲佐餐
<8-10,Raj>but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.

320
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,400
<8-10,Raj>非干型:形容葡萄酒有一些甜味 但不是很甜
<8-10,Raj>威士莲:最精致的白葡萄酒品种

321
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,130
<8-10,Raj>我也不确定
<8-10,Raj>I wasn't sure,

322
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,420
<8-10,Raj>但我实在不想
<8-10,Raj>but I didn't want to have an argument

323
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,700
<8-10,Raj>在乔氏超市连锁店跟她吵起来
<8-10,Raj>with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.

324
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,840
<8-10,Raj>该让Siri穿什么衣服赴宴呢
<8-10,Raj>Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner?

325

<8-10,Raj>性感的豹纹壳  闪耀的钻石壳
<8-10,Raj>Leopard, sparkles,

327
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,990
<8-10,Raj>或者用可可·香奈儿的话来说

328
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,860
<8-10,Raj>黑色是永不出错的颜色

334
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,030
<8-12,Raj>我不敢相信居然在格兰岱尔凯丹广场  买到了我的灵魂伴侣
<8-12,Raj>I can't believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.

335
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,740
<8-13,Bernadette>我觉得我待不下去了
<8-13,Bernadette>I don't know if I want to stay.

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,950
<9-2,Leonard>我打电话给你爸
<9-2,Leonard>I called your dad.

339

<9-2,Leonard>问他你小时候都爱玩些什么
<9-2,Leonard>I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid.

340
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,890
<9-2,Leonard>来这里比找头牛让你玩推到
<9-2,Leonard>This seemed easier than getting a cow out here

341
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,290
<9-2,Leonard>容易多了
<9-2,Leonard>so you could tip it.
