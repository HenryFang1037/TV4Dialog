<3-3,Penny>go to the beach in the first place.

120
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,720
<3-3,Penny>而且他超怕踩到医疗垃圾
<3-3,Penny>And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste,

121
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,620
<3-3,Penny>怕到我得背着他下水
<3-3,Penny>I had to carry him to the water.

122
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,320
<3-4,Bernadette>我也带霍华德去过一次海滩
<3-4,Bernadette>I took Howard to the beach once.

123
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,390
<3-4,Bernadette>他差点像个吸血鬼一样着起火来
<3-4,Bernadette>He almost burst into flames like a vampire.

124
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,560
<3-5,Penny>我费了那么大劲把莱纳德改造成
<3-5,Penny>So what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard

125
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,270
<3-5,Penny>一个超级无敌好男友  可结果我得到了什么
<3-5,Penny>into quality boyfriend material?

126
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,430
<3-5,Penny>我在他女朋友面前还得处处谨小慎微
<3-5,Penny>I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.

127
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,100
<3-6,Amy>你该说那句话了
<3-6,Amy>I think you're on.

128
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,370
<3-7,Bernadette>那个臭婊子
<3-7,Bernadette>That bitch!

129
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,110
<3-8,Penny>雪糕上要不要加点咖啡利口酒
<3-8,Penny>Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?

130
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,010
<3-9,Amy>这就是我妈警告过我的那种
<3-9,Amy>Ah, here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure

131
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,510
<3-9,Amy>同辈人会教唆我喝酒和嗑药的情景
<3-9,Amy>Mother warned me about.

132
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,350
<3-9,Amy>我还以为永远不会有这么一天呢
<3-9,Amy>I was starting to think it was never going to happen.

133
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,090
<3-9,Amy>我要  谢谢
<3-9,Amy>Yes, please.

134
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,790
<3-10,Penny>你们真应该见识一下我最初认识的莱纳德
<3-10,Penny>You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him.

135
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,790
<3-10,Penny>他都不敢跟人有眼神交流
<3-10,Penny>There was no eye contact.

136
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,190
<3-10,Penny>他不是抬头看天花板
<3-10,Penny>He was either looking up at the ceiling,

137
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,860
<3-10,Penny>就是低头看他的鞋
<3-10,Penny>or down at his shoes.

138
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,790
<3-11,Amy>我醉了
<3-11,Amy>I'm drunk.

139
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
<3-12,Penny>刚开始的几个月
<3-12,Penny>You know, for the first couple of months,

140
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
<3-12,Penny>每次我脱掉胸衣
<3-12,Penny>whenever I would take off my bra,

141
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,240
<3-12,Penny>他都会傻笑着说  天啊  我最胸的朋友
<3-12,Penny>he would giggle and say, "Oh, boy, my breast friends"!

142
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,510
<3-13,Bernadette>不知道我这么说你会不会好受点
<3-13,Bernadette>Well, if it makes you feel any better,

143
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,480
<3-13,Bernadette>但我以后再也不会理普丽娅了
<3-13,Bernadette>I'm never speaking to Priya again.

144
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,510
<3-14,Penny>不  别这样
<3-14,Penny>No, don't do that.

145
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,080
<3-14,Penny>咱也没理由欺负她呀
<3-14,Penny>No reason to be mean to her.

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,480
<3-15,Amy>这也许是醉话
<3-15,Amy>This may be the alcohol talking...

147
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,750
<3-15,Amy>但我觉得咱还真有理由欺负她
<3-15,Amy>but I believe there is.

148
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,890
<3-15,Amy>你有没有听说过京都大学的西田
<3-15,Amy>Are you familiar with the recent study

149
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,320
<3-15,Amy>和保坂最近做的一项
<3-15,Amy>of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka

150
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,560
<3-15,Amy>关于坦桑尼亚黑猩猩的研究
<3-15,Amy>out of Kyoto University?

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,790
<3-16,Penny>没有  但我可以叫出所有卡戴珊姐妹的名字
<3-16,Penny>No, but I can name all the Kardashians.

152
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,700
<3-17,Amy>像咱们这种灵长类动物  天生就会
<3-17,Amy>Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct

153
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,330
<3-17,Amy>排斥族群里不守规矩的成员
<3-17,Amy>to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop.

154
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,670
<3-18,Bernadette>伯纳黛特想要
<3-18,Bernadette>Bernadette's urge to

155
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,470
<3-17,Amy>躲避  发怒  或是用排泄物扔普丽娅的冲动
<3-17,Amy>shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya

156
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,710
<3-17,Amy>是与生俱来的
<3-17,Amy>is hard-wired into her DNA.

157
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,610
<3-18,Bernadette>我没有扔自己排泄物的冲动
<3-18,Bernadette>I don't have an urge to fling my waste.

158
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,980
<3-19,Amy>相信我  你有的  每个人都有
<3-19,Amy>Believe me, it's there, we all have it.

159
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,110
<3-19,Amy>再给我来点酒我就示范给你看
<3-19,Amy>Hit me with some more booze, and I'll show you.

160
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,590
<4-1,Howard>好了  我们到了  这就是进行
<4-1,Howard>All right, here we are -- this is the tavern

161
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,220
<4-1,Howard>所有黑市武器交易的小酒馆
<4-1,Howard>where all the black-market weapon trades go down.

162
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,030
<4-2,Raj>我觉得我的角色不应该来这种地方
<4-2,Raj>I don't think my character should be in a place like this.

163
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,230
<4-2,Raj>大家都盯着她开始意淫
<4-2,Raj>Everyone's undressing her with their eyes.

164
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,400
<4-3,Howard>要是你不老是把剑掉到地上
<4-3,Howard>Maybe if you stop dropping your sword

165
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,630
<4-3,Howard>然后再弯腰去捡的话  也许就不会这样了
<4-3,Howard>and bending over to pick it up.

166
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,740
<4-4,Leonard>好吧  我们到底要找什么
<4-4,Leonard>Okay, what exactly are we looking for?

167
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,770
<4-5,Howard>一个叫"忧郁"的红发巨魔
<4-5,Howard>Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly.

168
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,800
<4-5,Howard>据留言板上的消息说
<4-5,Howard>According to the message boards,

169
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,340
<4-5,Howard>如果你想在深更半夜
<4-5,Howard>if you want to move stolen goods

170
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,480
<4-5,Howard>转移偷来的东西的话  找他就对了
<4-5,Howard>and it's after school hours, he's your guy.

171
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,000
<4-6,Priya>莱纳德  你还要弄很久吗
<4-6,Priya>Leonard, is this going to take much longer?

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,980
<4-6,Priya>你不是说要过二人世界嘛
<4-6,Priya>I thought we were going to spend some time together.

<4-7,Leonard>you're welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.

175
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,750

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,320
<4-9,Leonard>不过真挺好玩的
<4-9,Leonard>but it's fun.

178
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,090
<4-10,Priya>也许我该回家了
<4-10,Priya>Maybe I should just go home.

179
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,590
<4-11,Howard>巨魔来了  我跟上去了
<4-11,Howard>Our troll just walked in! I got him!

<4-12,Leonard>我们找到他了  就快搞掂了
<4-12,Leonard>We got him. We're almost done.

181
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,730
<4-13,Howard>那么你们打算怎么办
<4-13,Howard>So, how do you guys want to play this?

<4-14,Sheldon>狠狠教训他  你跟他说
<4-14,Sheldon>Be ruthless. You tell him

183
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,570
<4-14,Sheldon>如果他不从实招来的话  我们就
<4-14,Sheldon>if he doesn't start talking, we'll register a complaint

184
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,500
<4-14,Sheldon>向他的网络供应商做出正式投诉
<4-14,Sheldon>with his Internet service provider.

<4-15,Raj>谢尔顿  要是他是从有线电视公司
<4-15,Raj>Sheldon,what if he gets his Internet

186
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,940
<4-15,Raj>连接互联网的怎么办
<4-15,Raj>from his cable company?

187
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,500
<4-15,Raj>他会失去他的HBO有线电视
<4-15,Raj>He could lose his HBO

<4-17,Leonard>我们不如玩得聪明点
<4-17,Leonard>Why don't we play this smart?

191
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,990
<4-17,Leonard>试试"好妖精 坏妖精"
<4-17,Leonard>Try a little "good goblin, bad goblin."

192
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,060
<4-18,Priya>神啊
<4-18,Priya>Oh, dear Lord.

193
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,320
<4-19,Howard>不  我觉得我们得更狡猾些
<4-19,Howard>Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.

194
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,290
<4-20,Raj>好了  我知道你们的意思了
<4-20,Raj>Okay, I see where this is going.

196
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,970
<4-21,Leonard>我们不是那个意思
<4-21,Leonard>That's not where it was going.

197
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,200
<4-22,Raj>太好了  因为我很讨厌那样
<4-22,Raj>Good, because I would hate that.

<4-25,Priya>不不  我觉得跟一个男人身男孩心的人约会很性感
<4-25,Priya>No, no, I think it's sexy to date a boy trapped in a man's body.

<4-26,Leonard>太好了
<4-26,Leonard>Good, good.

335
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,250
<8-1,Leonard>居然一路杀到圣地亚哥

<8-5,Sheldon>It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun.

342
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,100

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,310
<8-7,Sheldon>郊区农场的可怜虫感到抱歉
<8-7,Sheldon>sitting in his split-level suburban ranch,

347
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,540
<8-7,Sheldon>完全没意识到有一群复仇的人们
<8-7,Sheldon>unaware that a vengeful horde

348
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,350
<8-7,Sheldon>正以每小时71迈的速度
<8-7,Sheldon>is barreling down the San Diego Freeway

349
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,580
<8-7,Sheldon>飞驰在圣地亚哥的高速上
<8-7,Sheldon>at 71 miles an hour.
