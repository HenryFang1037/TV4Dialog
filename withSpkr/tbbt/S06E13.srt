1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,780
<1-1,Leonard>弄好可以也烫下我的制服吗
<1-1,Leonard>Hey, will you steam my uniform next?

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,300
<1-1,Leonard>哟  真有意思
<1-1,Leonard>Yeah, w... interesting.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,010
<1-2,Sheldon>你还记得我们这段对话吗
<1-2,Sheldon>Do you recall this conversation?

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,380
<1-2,Sheldon>"莱纳德  要不要跟我摊挂烫机的钱"
<1-2,Sheldon>"Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer?"

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,090
<1-2,Sheldon>"不要  谢尔顿  我们又用不到"
<1-2,Sheldon>"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,900
<1-2,Sheldon>看来有人现在自食恶果了吧
<1-2,Sheldon>Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,580
<1-3,Penny>这是你要的化妆海绵
<1-3,Penny>Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,530
<1-4,Leonard>谢啦  我本来以为我还有不少
<1-4,Leonard>Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,300
<1-5,Penny>靠  你的化妆品比我还多
<1-5,Penny>Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,420
<1-5,Penny>而且还比我用的都高级
<1-5,Penny>You've got better makeup than I do.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,710
<1-5,Penny>这个老娘借了
<1-5,Penny>Yeah, I'm borrowing this.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,990
<1-6,Leonard>这是我动漫大会专用化妆品
<1-6,Leonard>This is my Comic-Con makeup.

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,380
<1-6,Leonard>我爱你  但有些东西是男子汉们
<1-6,Leonard>I love you, but there are some things

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,940
<1-6,Leonard>不能与女友分享的
<1-6,Leonard>a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,290
<1-7,Sheldon>十分明智的原则
<1-7,Sheldon>That's a wise policy.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,350
<1-7,Sheldon>我曾为化装比赛借用了我妹妹的化妆品
<1-7,Sheldon>I once borrowed my sister's makeup for a costume contest.

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,200
<1-7,Sheldon>结果被传染到红眼病
<1-7,Sheldon>Got a terrible case of pinkeye.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,060
<1-7,Sheldon>幸好那年我刚好是想化装成僵尸
<1-7,Sheldon>Yeah, but luckily, I was going as a zombie.

20
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,640
<1-7,Sheldon>因此还赢得了第二名呢
<1-7,Sheldon>I won second place.

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,790
<1-8,Penny>你们不是才去过动漫大会吗
<1-8,Penny>I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,050
<1-9,Leonard>上次是圣地亚哥动漫大会
<1-9,Leonard>That was San Diego Comic-Con.

23
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,200
<1-9,Leonard>这次是贝克尔斯菲动漫大会
<1-9,Leonard>This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,110
<1-10,Penny>这次的有比较好吗
<1-10,Penny>Is that better?

25
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,050
<1-11,Leonard>其实规模小了很多
<1-11,Leonard>Well, it's a lot smaller.

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,330
<1-11,Leonard>但重心主要放在漫画书上
<1-11,Leonard>It's more about the comic books.

27
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,640
<1-11,Leonard>以前传统的大会都是这样
<1-11,Leonard>The way these conventions used to be

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,330
<1-11,Leonard>而不是像现在的好莱坞电影潮
<1-11,Leonard>before they went all Hollywood.

29
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,450
<1-12,Sheldon>简单扼要地回答你  这场没比较好
<1-12,Sheldon>So to answer your question, no, it's not better.

30
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,120
<1-13,Penny>那你们干嘛还去啊
<1-13,Penny>Well, then why are you going?

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,980
<1-14,Sheldon>始终还是漫画大会
<1-14,Sheldon>It's a comic book convention.

32
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,190
<1-14,Sheldon>就如同披萨或粒子加速器一样嘛
<1-14,Sheldon>You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators,

33
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,600
<1-14,Sheldon>就算做得不好  也还是可以接受
<1-14,Sheldon>even the stinky one's still pretty good.

34
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,740
<1-14,Sheldon>好吧
<1-14,Sheldon>All right.

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,830
<1-15,Penny>那祝你们玩得开心
<1-15,Penny>Well, you guys have fun.

36
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,100
<1-15,Penny>那估计是周日晚再见了吧
<1-15,Penny>I guess I'll see you Sunday night.

37
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,060
<1-17,Penny>-是的  行
<1-17,Penny>- Yeah. - Okay.

38
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,440
<1-18,Leonard>你等一下
<1-18,Leonard>Oh, hang on a second.

39
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,600
<1-18,Leonard>举着这个
<1-18,Leonard>Hold this.

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,120
<1-19,Penny>这是干嘛
<1-19,Penny>What was that for?

41
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,370
<1-20,Leonard>作为别人不信我有美女女友时的证据
<1-20,Leonard>To show people when they don't believe me.

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,390
<1-20,Leonard>生活大爆炸
<1-20,Leonard>第六季  第十三集

43
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,580
<2-1,Penny>这样最爽了
<2-1,Penny>Oh, this is the best.

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,380
<2-1,Penny>如果你平日吃早餐时配酒喝
<2-1,Penny>You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday,

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,480
<2-1,Penny>人家会说你酗酒
<2-1,Penny>you got a problem.

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,340
<2-1,Penny>但如果是周末这样  就能推说是早午餐
<2-1,Penny>You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.

47
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,140
<2-2,Amy>谢尔顿不爱早午餐这套
<2-2,Amy>Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.

48
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,370
<2-2,Amy>他无法忍受吃饭时
<2-2,Amy>He can't stand being at a table

49
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,690
<2-2,Amy>一边有人在吃早餐煎蛋卷
<2-2,Amy>where one person's having an omelet

50
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,930
<2-2,Amy>而另一边有人在吃午餐三明治
<2-2,Amy>and another person's having a sandwich.

51
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,980
<2-3,Bernadette>他真是不厌其"烦"啊
<2-3,Bernadette>He's not exhausting at all.

52
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,990
<2-4,Penny (receiving text)>莱纳德发的短信  说他们在路上了
<2-4,Penny (receiving text)>It's Leonard, he says they're on the road

53
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,890
<2-4,Penny (receiving text)>正"曲速前进"贝克尔斯菲市呢
<2-4,Penny (receiving text)>and headed for Bakersfield at "warp speed."

55
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,290
<2-4,Penny (receiving text)>可能这含羞草鸡尾酒上头
<2-4,Penny (receiving text)>Maybe it's the Mimosa,

56
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,570
<2-4,Penny (receiving text)>但我就大发慈悲给他回个"哈哈哈"吧
<2-4,Penny (receiving text)>but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.

57
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,680
<2-5,Bernadette>他们兴奋这些事的样子真可爱
<2-5,Bernadette>It's cute how excited they are.

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,950
<2-5,Bernadette>你们应该看看霍华德
<2-5,Bernadette>You should have seen Howard

59
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,710
<2-5,Bernadette>为了参加大会  缝了整周服装的样子
<2-5,Bernadette>sewing his costume all week for the convention.

60
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
<2-6,Amy>霍华德什么时候学的缝纫啊
<2-6,Amy>When did Howard learn to sew?

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,350
<2-7,Bernadette>他小时候  每隔几个月
<2-7,Bernadette>When he was a little boy, every couple months,

62
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,260
<2-7,Bernadette>都要帮他妈把旧裤子重新缝大一点
<2-7,Bernadette>he would have to let his mom's pants out.

63
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,630
<2-8,Amy>我真不知道他们为什么会去这些大会
<2-8,Amy>I don't even understand why they go to these conventions.

64
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,310
<2-8,Amy>对啊
<2-8,Amy>I know.

65
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,850
<2-9,Penny>他们四个都在知名大学工作
<2-9,Penny>The four of them work at a major university.

66
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,010
<2-9,Penny>他们都超级聪明
<2-9,Penny>They're all super smart.

67
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,530
<2-9,Penny>怎么会还在痴迷12岁小孩的玩意呢
<2-9,Penny>How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?

68
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,970
<2-10,Bernadette>我是不介意啦
<2-10,Bernadette>I don't mind it.

69
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,270
<2-10,Bernadette>我觉得霍华德只是内心有孩子气的一面
<2-10,Bernadette>I think Howie's just in touch with his inner child.

70
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,370
<2-10,Bernadette>不过有时候他穿着蝙蝠侠睡衣上床时
<2-10,Bernadette>Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pajamas,

71
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,720
<2-10,Bernadette>我都感觉是其实他就是个小孩
<2-10,Bernadette>sometimes it feels like I'm touching his inner child.

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,310
<2-11,Amy>可能是因为他们从小被欺负到大吧
<2-11,Amy>It's probably because they were bullied growing up.

73
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,080
<2-11,Amy>在一个人自身无力反抗时
<2-11,Amy>In a world where you can't fight back,

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,820
<2-11,Amy>超级英雄能满足他们心中的愿望
<2-11,Amy>superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.

75
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,380
<2-12,Penny>现在我对自己欺负过的那些人感到内疚
<2-12,Penny>Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids.

76
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,660
<2-12,Penny>但我也要替自己辩驳
<2-12,Penny>Although, in my defense,

77
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,630
<2-12,Penny>当年丹尼·比佛要不想被欺负得满嘴泥
<2-12,Penny>if Danny Biffle didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt,

78
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,660
<2-12,Penny>就不该戴着一个欠扁的蠢领结来上学
<2-12,Penny>he shouldn't have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.

79
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,010
<2-13,Bernadette>我没有看过漫画书呢  你们呢
<2-13,Bernadette>I've never even read a comic book. You guys?

80
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,240
<2-14,Penny>-没  -没有过
<2-14,Penny>- Uh-uh. - No.

81
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,150
<2-16,Bernadette>这东西对他们生命那么重要
<2-16,Bernadette>I mean, it's such an important part of their lives.

82
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,730
<2-16,Bernadette>我们也许该去试着看看啊
<2-16,Bernadette>Maybe we should try reading some.

83
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,130
<2-17,Amy>你说真的吗
<2-17,Amy>Seriously?

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,300
<2-18,Bernadette>漫画店离这里也不远啊
<2-18,Bernadette>The comic book store isn't far from here.

85
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,120
<2-19,Penny>这主意太棒了
<2-19,Penny>That is an amazing idea.

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,420
<2-19,Penny>靠  我是喝了多少杯啦
<2-19,Penny>Okay, how many of these have I had?

87
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,520
<3-1,Sheldon>我觉得你该开卫星导航器
<3-1,Sheldon>I think you should turn on the GPS.

88
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,750
<3-2,Leonard>开了啊
<3-2,Leonard>It is on.

89
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,910
<3-3,Sheldon>可你没开语音导航功能
<3-3,Sheldon>But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.

90
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,380
<3-3,Sheldon>你要是打开那个
<3-3,Sheldon>I know I'd feel more safe

91
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,250
<3-3,Sheldon>我会感觉到加倍安心呢
<3-3,Sheldon>if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option.

92
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,140
<3-3,Sheldon>我爱死语音导航功能了
<3-3,Sheldon>I love the turn-by-turn voice option.

93
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,180
<3-4,Howard>真的只开了10英里而已吗
<3-4,Howard>Has it really only been ten miles?

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,940
<3-5,Leonard>为了让你闭嘴  我现在就开
<3-5,Leonard>I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.

95
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,940
<3-6,GPS (in Sheldon’s voice)>莱纳德  向左转
<3-6,GPS (in Sheldon’s voice)>Leonard, bear left

96
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,600
<3-6,GPS (in Sheldon’s voice)>沿着210洲际公路继续前行
<3-6,GPS (in Sheldon’s voice)>and continue on Interstate 210.

97
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,150
<3-7,Sheldon>语音导航的那人听起来很懂行啊
<3-7,Sheldon>Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about.

98
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,310
<3-7,Sheldon>我要是你  一定会洗耳恭听的
<3-7,Sheldon>I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.

99
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,130
<3-8,Leonard>你对导航器干嘛了
<3-8,Leonard>What did you do?

100
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,010
<3-9,Sheldon>我网上找到了个破解软件
<3-9,Sheldon>I found a hack online.

101
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,860
<3-9,Sheldon>能让我把自己录制的声音档
<3-9,Sheldon>I was able to upload MP3 recordings

102
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,090
<3-9,Sheldon>上传到你的导航器
<3-9,Sheldon>of my voice to your GPS.

103
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,290
<3-10,Raj>这太酷了
<3-10,Raj>That is so cool.

104
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,260
<3-11,Leonard>反对  一点都不酷
<3-11,Leonard>Counterpoint, no, it's not.

105
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,130
<3-11,Leonard>继续沿着210洲际公路
<3-11,Leonard>Continue on Interstate 210

106
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,890
<3-12,GPS>前行5英里
<3-12,GPS>for five miles.

107
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,530
<3-12,GPS>以下是一则关于洲际公路的有趣小知识
<3-12,GPS>Here's an interesting fact about interstates.

108
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,220
<3-13,Leonard>你不是吧
<3-13,Leonard>Really?

109
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,090
<3-14,Sheldon>别吵  人家说是有趣小知识呢
<3-14,Sheldon>Shh, he said it's interesting.

110
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,540
<3-15,GPS>洲际公路数字命名的规则是
<3-15,GPS>Interstates are numbered as follows.

111
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,070
<3-15,GPS>偶数公路走东西向
<3-15,GPS>Even-numbered routes run east and west,

112
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,330
<3-15,GPS>奇数公路走南北向
<3-15,GPS>odd-numbered routes run north and south.

113
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,340
<3-15,GPS>三位数公路表示环绕郊区
<3-15,GPS>Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses

114
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,530
<3-15,GPS>或支路
<3-15,GPS>or spurs.

115
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,660
<3-16,Howard>瞧  莱纳德  那有座桥
<3-16,Howard>Look, Leonard, there's a bridge.

116
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,430
<3-16,Howard>冲出去死了算了
<3-16,Howard>Drive off it.

117
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,190
<3-17,Raj>我们离华斯克巨岩公园不远了
<3-17,Raj>You know, we're not that far from Vazquez Rocks.

118
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,480
<3-18,Sheldon>《星际迷航》有很多集都是在那里拍的
<3-18,Sheldon>Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.

119
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,580
<3-19,Howard>我们的化装服就在车里
<3-19,Howard>We've got our costumes in the trunk.

<3-19,Howard>我们可以去那里  拍几张照片
<3-19,Howard>We could go there and have a little photo shoot.

<3-20,Raj>瘦得颧骨都凸起来了  不赶紧拍照
<3-20,Raj>These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera

124
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,400
<3-20,Raj>不然一块椒盐卷饼下肚  就打回原形了
<3-20,Raj>before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.

125
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,200
<3-21,Leonard>好啊  听起来不错

128
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,680
<3-24,Sheldon>幸好车上有人知道

<4-3,Stuart>你们又不是没在电影或漫画里见过
<4-3,Stuart>It's nothing you haven't seen in movies or in drawings.

<4-6,Bernadette>We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.

145
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,050
<4-7,Stuart>我的建议是  千万不要以卖漫画书为生
<4-7,Stuart>Oh, well, I recommend you don't open a store and sell them.

146
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,670
<4-8,Penny>不是啦  我们只是好奇
<4-8,Penny>No, we were just wondering

147
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,040
<4-8,Penny>为什么男生这么喜欢看漫画
<4-8,Penny>why the guys like this stuff so much,

148
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,410
<4-8,Penny>所以我们想试试看
<4-8,Penny>so we thought we'd give it a try.

<4-12,Amy>好吧  那谁是最厉害的超级英雄
<4-12,Amy>All right, well, who's the best superhero?

156
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,750
<4-13,Stuart>你不能在这里问这种问题
<4-13,Stuart>You can't ask a question like that in here.

157
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,770
<4-13,Stuart>你是想挑起宅男骂战吗

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,430

<4-18,Stuart>如果我是你  我会选《成人童话》第一集
<4-18,Stuart>If I were you, I'd go for Fables number one.

<4-18,Stuart>画风复杂精致
<4-18,Stuart>The artwork is sophisticated,

168
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,610
<4-18,Stuart>情节千回百转
<4-18,Stuart>it's intelligently written,

169
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,840
<4-18,Stuart>而且没有物化或有女性刻板印象
<4-18,Stuart>and it doesn't objectify or stereotype women.

175
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,220
<5-1,Raj>大功告成
<5-1,Raj>and we're done.

176
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,700
<5-2,Sheldon>我知道数据机器人不应该笑
<5-2,Sheldon>I know Mr. Data isn't supposed to smile,

177
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,530
<5-2,Sheldon>但我要笑一个
<5-2,Sheldon>but here it comes.

<5-9,Sheldon>数据机器人的武器就是脑子
<5-9,Sheldon>Mr. Data's weapon is his mind.

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,030
<5-16,Sheldon>偷车是犯法的
<5-16,Sheldon>Stealing is against the law!

198

<5-17,Leonard>真不敢相信
<5-17,Leonard>I don't believe this.

199
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,360
<5-18,Howard>混蛋
<5-18,Howard>Son of a bitch.

204
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,970
<5-21,Leonard>有人有办法吗
<5-21,Leonard>Anybody got any ideas?

205
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,180
<5-22,Sheldon>没有
<5-22,Sheldon>Nope.

206
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,950
<5-22,Sheldon>唯一能做的事就是怪罪某人
<5-22,Sheldon>The only thing left to do now is assign blame.

207
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,490
<5-22,Sheldon>都怪你
<5-22,Sheldon>Nice going.

208
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,580
<6-1,Leonard>谁会在光天化日之下公然偷走别人的车啊
<6-1,Leonard>What kind of a person steals another person's car in broad daylight?

209
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,180
<6-2,Sheldon>谁会把车钥匙留在车里不拿走啊
<6-2,Sheldon>What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?

210
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,380
<6-3,Leonard>不是说好都怪库萨帕里了吗
<6-3,Leonard>I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.

211
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,620
<6-3,Leonard>你说得对
<6-3,Leonard>You're right.

212
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,080
<6-4,Sheldon>都怪你
<6-4,Sheldon>Nice going.

213
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,010
<6-5,Howard>有车
<6-5,Howard>Car.

214
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,400
<6-6,Raj>这些人怎么搞的  干嘛不停车
<6-6,Raj>What is wrong with people? Why don't they stop?

215
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,930
<6-7,Sheldon>也许这样更好
<6-7,Sheldon>Maybe we're better off.

216
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,630
<6-7,Sheldon>万一我们上了神经病的车就惨了
<6-7,Sheldon>You know, what if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?

217
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,330
<6-8,Leonard>照照镜子吧  谢尔顿
<6-8,Leonard>Look at us, Sheldon.

218
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,890
<6-8,Leonard>我们就是神经病
<6-8,Leonard>We're the crazy people.

219
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,240
<6-9,Sheldon>也许我们该举个牌子
<6-9,Sheldon>Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign

220
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,100
<6-9,Sheldon>告诉来往车辆我们的精神很正常
<6-9,Sheldon>that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.

221
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,330
<6-10,Howard>这主意真棒  那你还不赶紧做牌子
<6-10,Howard>Good idea. Why don't you get started on that?

222
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,690
<6-11,Leonard>算了  咱们用走的吧
<6-11,Leonard>Come on, let's just start walking.

223
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,800
<6-11,Leonard>这附近肯定有加油站之类的
<6-11,Leonard>There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.

224
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,580
<6-12,Sheldon>就因为你穿着船长的制服
<6-12,Sheldon>What, you think just because you're wearing a captain's uniform,

225
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,930
<6-12,Sheldon>你就能发号施令了是吗
<6-12,Sheldon>you're in charge?

226
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,570
<6-13,Leonard>是的
<6-13,Leonard>Yes.

227
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,190
<6-14,Sheldon>好吧
<6-14,Sheldon>All right.

228
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,150
<7-1,Penny>我看完了
<7-1,Penny>Hmm, okay, I'm done.

229
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,490
<7-1,Penny>你们怎么看得那么快
<7-1,Penny>How did you guys finish so fast?

230
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,110
<7-2,Bernadette>大部分都只是图片啊
<7-2,Bernadette>I don't know, there were a lot of pictures,

231
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,780
<7-2,Bernadette>有一页上甚至只写了一句"受死吧"
<7-2,Bernadette>and one page only had the word "Brakkadoom!"

232
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,470
<7-3,Penny>行  聪明人脑子快  可我有街头智慧
<7-3,Penny>Yeah, well, I have street smarts.

233
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,010
<7-4,Bernadette>你们怎么看
<7-4,Bernadette>So, what'd you guys think?

234
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,660
<7-5,Amy>书里有许多打斗场景
<7-5,Amy>Well, there was a lot of action,

235
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,460
<7-7,Amy>情节跌宕起伏
<7-7,Amy>and the story moved along at a brisk pace.

236
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,210
<7-7,Amy>总体来说
<7-7,Amy>It was, overall...

237
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,080
<7-7,Amy>我该怎么形容呢
<7-7,Amy>what's the word I'm looking for?

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,910
<7-9,Amy>-蠢  -超蠢的
<7-9,Amy>- Stupid? - So stupid.

239
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,930
<7-10,Penny>真不知道莱纳德怎么会对这玩意这么着迷
<7-10,Penny>I don't know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.

240
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,430
<7-11,Bernadette>太荒唐了  他们竟然花大量的时间
<7-11,Bernadette>It's crazy; they spend hours

241
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,610
<7-11,Bernadette>讨论这些虚无缥缈的东西
<7-11,Bernadette>arguing about things that don't even exist.

242
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,310
<7-12,Amy>-真是浪费光阴  -可不是嘛
<7-12,Amy>- What a waste of time. - I know.

243
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,030
<7-13,Penny>什么一把重到只有雷神才举得起的铁锤啊
<7-13,Penny>A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?

244
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,600
<7-14,Bernadette>我觉得不是因为它重
<7-14,Bernadette>I don't think it's heavy.

245
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,800
<7-14,Bernadette>而是铁锤上有某种魔法
<7-14,Bernadette>I think it's some sort of magic,

246
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,670
<7-14,Bernadette>所以只有雷神才能举起它
<7-14,Bernadette>so only Thor can lift it.

247
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,820
<7-15,Penny>这更说不通啊
<7-15,Penny>That makes even less sense, I mean...

248
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,340
<7-16,Amy>不不  就应该是这样
<7-16,Amy>No, no, no, it doesn't.

249
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,430
<7-16,Amy>雷神是神
<7-16,Amy>Thor is a god.

250
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,750
<7-16,Amy>铁锤是他的  只有他能用
<7-16,Amy>The hammer is his; only he can use it.

251
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,710
<7-16,Amy>就像谢尔顿和他的牙刷
<7-16,Amy>It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush.

252
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,290
<7-16,Amy>或者谢尔顿和他那两片诱人薄唇
<7-16,Amy>Or his thin, beckoning lips.

253
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,430
<7-16,Amy>等一下
<7-16,Amy>Okay, hang on,

254
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,420
<7-17,Penny>要是雷神正拿着铁锤呢
<7-17,Penny>what if Thor's hand is on the hammer?

255
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,320
<7-17,Penny>如果他正拿着铁锤发力
<7-17,Penny>I mean, if he's touching it with his god magic,

256
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,040
<7-17,Penny>那是不是我也可以拿起它
<7-17,Penny>does that mean I could lift it?

257
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,650
<7-19,Amy>-不是  -是的
<7-19,Amy>- No. - Yes.

258
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,210
<7-20,Penny>到底怎样
<7-20,Penny>Well, which is it?

259
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,070
<7-21,Amy>我们是不是漏了什么细节
<7-21,Amy>Maybe we missed something.

260
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,290
<7-22,Bernadette>再看一遍吧
<7-22,Bernadette>Let's read it again.

261
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,020
<7-24,Amy>-好吧  -行
<7-24,Amy>- Okay. - Yeah.

262
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,430
<7-25,Bernadette>想喝点茶吗
<7-25,Bernadette>You want some tea?

263
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,220
<7-26,Amy>好主意  我帮你
<7-26,Amy>Good idea. I'll help you.

264
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,050
<7-27,Penny>不是要一起再看一遍吗
<7-27,Penny>Wait, I thought we were reading.

265
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,200
<7-28,Amy>要的
<7-28,Amy>We are.

266
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,780
<7-28,Amy>你先开始吧  我们晚点不要紧
<7-28,Amy>We're just, uh, giving you a head start.

267
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,730
<8-1,Howard>真希望我妈妈在这儿
<8-1,Howard>I wish my mom was here.

268
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,300
<8-1,Howard>我们就都可以在她的影子下乘凉了
<8-1,Howard>We could all hang out in her shadow.

269
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,350
<8-2,Raj>漫漫沙漠行  毛裤贴我身
<8-2,Raj>Wool pants in the desert.

270
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,300
<8-2,Raj>熊熊烈日下  蛋蛋火上蒸
<8-2,Raj>I feel like I've got poached testicles.

271
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,700
<8-3,Leonard>可怜的你啊
<8-3,Leonard>Oh, you poor thing;

272
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,810
<8-3,Leonard>瞧你那汗流的
<8-3,Leonard>you're sweating.

273
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,540
<8-3,Leonard>可真是比车被人偷了还可怜
<8-3,Leonard>That's so much worse than having your car stolen.

274
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,450
<8-4,Raj>保险公司会赔你辆新车
<8-4,Raj>Insurance is gonna buy you a new car.

275
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,670
<8-4,Raj>请问谁能赔我大雕
<8-4,Raj>It's not gonna de-funk my junk.

276
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,730
<8-5,Sheldon>先生们
<8-5,Sheldon>Gentlemen,

277
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,760
<8-5,Sheldon>不要再满腹牢骚了
<8-5,Sheldon>a little less bellyaching.

278
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,290
<8-5,Sheldon>我们是星际舰队的军官
<8-5,Sheldon>We're Starfleet officers

279
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,430
<8-5,Sheldon>是博格集合体的一份子
<8-5,Sheldon>and a member of the Borg Collective.

280
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,490
<8-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  拜托  我现在真没心情入戏
<8-6,Leonard>Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.

281
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,890
<8-6,Leonard>莱纳德
<8-6,Leonard>Leonard,

282
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,200
<8-7,Sheldon>我们一直都在梦想
<8-7,Sheldon>all our lives we have dreamed

283
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,380
<8-7,Sheldon>进入我们所挚爱的幻想世界
<8-7,Sheldon>of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love.

284
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,070
<8-7,Sheldon>看看现在的我们
<8-7,Sheldon>And look at us.

285
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,090
<8-7,Sheldon>现在我们真正成为了
<8-7,Sheldon>At this moment, we are, in fact,

286
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,000
<8-7,Sheldon>星际迷航的先遣登陆队
<8-7,Sheldon>a Star Trek landing party

287
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,100
<8-7,Sheldon>被困于荒芜凋敝的陌生环境
<8-7,Sheldon>stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment,

288
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,950
<8-7,Sheldon>只能依靠自己的智慧  坚毅
<8-7,Sheldon>relying only on our wits, our fortitude

289
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,610
<8-7,Sheldon>和勇气
<8-7,Sheldon>and our moxie.

290
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,680
<8-7,Sheldon>只要我们有这些品质
<8-7,Sheldon>As long as we have those things,

291
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,340
<8-8,Guys in Passing Car (throwing a drink over Sheldon)>-没有什么可以阻止  -书呆子
<8-8,Guys in Passing Car (throwing a drink over Sheldon)>- nothing can stop... - Nerds!

292
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,030
<8-9,Sheldon>我恨死这星球了
<8-9,Sheldon>I hate this planet.

293
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,460
<9-1,Amy>看  铁锤上写着呢
<9-1,Amy>It says right here on the hammer,

294
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,900
<9-1,Amy>"只要是配得上的人手持铁锤
<9-1,Amy>"Whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy,

295
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,680
<9-1,Amy>均可获得雷神的神力"
<9-1,Amy>shall possess the power of Thor."

296
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,510
<9-2,Bernadette>等一下  谁能决定他是否配得上
<9-2,Bernadette>Hold on, who decides who's worthy?

297
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,900
<9-2,Bernadette>是铁锤决定吗
<9-2,Bernadette>Does the hammer decide?

298
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,030
<9-3,Penny>-是的  -不是
<9-3,Penny>- Yes! - No!

299
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,710
<9-4,Amy>它无法决定
<9-4,Amy>It can't decide.

300
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,410
<9-4,Amy>它只是个铁锤
<9-4,Amy>It's a hammer.

301
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,140
<9-5,Penny>是你说它有魔力的
<9-5,Penny>You said it's a magic hammer.

302
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,960
<9-6,Amy>对  但它不能做决定啊
<9-6,Amy>Yeah, it can't make decisions.

303
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,350
<9-7,Penny>哈利·波特的魔杖都能选主人
<9-7,Penny>If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions,

304
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,320
<9-7,Penny>雷神的铁锤凭什么不行
<9-7,Penny>why can't Thor's hammer?

305
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,610
<9-8,Amy>你要是非要拿魔杖和铁锤比
<9-8,Amy>Okay, if you're going to start comparing wands and hammers,

306
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,800
<9-8,Amy>那我没啥话好对你说了
<9-8,Amy>I can't even take you seriously.

307
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,290
<10-1,Sheldon>你好
<10-1,Sheldon>Hello.

308
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,890
<10-1,Sheldon>你好
<10-1,Sheldon>Hello.

309
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,320
<10-1,Sheldon>请倒四杯水
<10-1,Sheldon>Uh, four glasses of water, please.

310
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,940
<10-1,Sheldon>你们要什么吗
<10-1,Sheldon>Anything for you guys?

311
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,960
<10-2,Leonard>能借电话用一下吗  我们的车被偷了
<10-2,Leonard>Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.

312
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,620
<10-3,Waitress>你们怎么不叫史考特传送你们上舰啊
<10-3,Waitress>Why don't you ask Scotty to beam you up?

314
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,740
<10-4,Sheldon>史考特是第一代系列人物
<10-4,Sheldon>Scotty was on the original series,

315
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,530
<10-4,Sheldon>而我们是《下一代》的
<10-4,Sheldon>and we're Next Generation.

316
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,990
<10-4,Sheldon>所以...
<10-4,Sheldon>So...

317
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,750
<10-4,Sheldon>糗的是你们
<10-4,Sheldon>joke's on you.

318
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,330
<10-5,Howard>我们跟他不是一起的
<10-5,Howard>We're not with him.

319
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,980
<11-1,Amy>你不能在外太空拿起任何东西
<11-1,Amy>You can't pick something up in outer space.

320
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,770
<11-1,Amy>-在太空里根本就没有"起"的概念  -是吗
<11-1,Amy>- In space, there is no up. - Oh, yeah?

321
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,570
<11-2,Penny>那为什么每天太阳都会升"起"呢
<11-2,Penny>Then how does the sun come "Up" every day?

322
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,860
<11-3,Amy>很难反驳如此的街头"智慧"啊
<11-3,Amy>Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.

323
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,320
<11-4,Bernadette>莱纳德和谢尔顿有成箱的漫画书在对面屋
<11-4,Bernadette>Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall.

324
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,520
<11-4,Bernadette>我们为何不过去找找答案
<11-4,Bernadette>Why don't we go look at those?

325
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,240
<11-5,Penny>很好  这样你们就会发现
<11-5,Penny>Oh, great! Yes! And then you will see.

326
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,000
<11-5,Penny>我没错  因为如果我们在外太空
<11-5,Penny>I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space,

327
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,490
<11-5,Penny>任何人都有可能举起锤子
<11-5,Penny>then anyone could pick up the hammer

328
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,460
<11-5,Penny>因为在失重环境下  它是漂浮在空中的
<11-5,Penny>because it would be floating around in a weightless environment.

329
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,580
<11-5,Penny>没错  看书慢的人也懂科学
<11-5,Penny>Yeah, that's right, the slow reader used science.

330
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,020
<11-5,Penny>去死吧
<11-5,Penny>Suck on that.

331
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,870
<12-1,Policeman>车里有什么值钱的东西
<12-1,Policeman>Was there anything valuable in the car?

332
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,480
<12-2,Leonard>衣服  钱包  手机
<12-2,Leonard>Our clothes, our wallets, phones.

333
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,450
<12-3,Raj>还有价值三百美元的化妆品
<12-3,Raj>And about $300 worth of makeup,

334
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,630
<12-3,Raj>所以现在偷车贼可以化妆成任何样子
<12-3,Raj>so this thief could look like anyone right now.

335
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,230
<12-4,Policeman>化妆品
<12-4,Policeman>Makeup?

336
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,040
<12-4,Policeman>不奇怪
<12-4,Policeman>Sure.

337
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,580
<12-5,Leonard>我们本打算去贝克尔斯菲的动漫大会
<12-5,Leonard>Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.

338
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,220
<12-5,Leonard>那里有个大型的化装比赛
<12-5,Leonard>They have a big costume contest.

339
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,570
<12-5,Leonard>其实没听起来那么蠢啦
<12-5,Leonard>It's cooler than it sounds.

340
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,220
<12-6,Policeman>还好  听起来还挺酷啊
<12-6,Policeman>I don't know, sounds pretty cool.

341
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,740
<12-6,Policeman>本来就很酷
<12-6,Policeman>I-It is.

342
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,850
<12-7,Raj>那里不仅只有漫画书
<12-7,Raj>It's not just comic books.

343
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,580
<12-7,Raj>还有人偶  玩具
<12-7,Raj>They've got action figures, toys,

344
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,120
<12-7,Raj>还有"电子世界争霸战"主题舞会
<12-7,Raj>a Tron-themed dance party...

345
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,820
<12-8,Leonard>行了  他已经了解有多酷了
<12-8,Leonard>Okay, he gets how cool it is.

346
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,890
<12-9,Policeman>我要问的都问完了
<12-9,Policeman>I think I have all I need here.

347
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,550
<12-9,Policeman>需要我帮你们联络谁吗
<12-9,Policeman>You guys need me to call someone?

348
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,390
<12-9,Policeman>我猜应该是你们妈妈吧
<12-9,Policeman>I'm guessing your moms?

349
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,390
<12-10,Leonard>多谢  我们自己能搞定
<12-10,Leonard>Thanks, but we've got it covered.

350
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,800
<12-11,Howard>好了  我刚跟我妈通完电话
<12-11,Howard>Okay, I just talked to my mom.

351
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,150
<12-11,Howard>她帮我们租了辆车
<12-11,Howard>She arranged for us to get a rental car.

352
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,000
<12-12,Raj>太好了
<12-12,Raj>Great.

353
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,640
<12-12,Raj>我们还可以去动漫大会
<12-12,Raj>We can still make it to Comic-Con.

354
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,920
<12-13,Leonard>你开什么玩笑
<12-13,Leonard>Are you kidding me?

355
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,210
<12-13,Leonard>遭了这么多罪  我现在只想回家
<12-13,Leonard>After all we've been through, I just want to go home.

356
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,610
<12-14,Raj>别这样嘛
<12-14,Raj>Don't be like that.

357
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,980
<12-14,Raj>拜托  霍华德  劝劝他
<12-14,Raj>Come on, Howard, talk to him.

358
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,480
<12-15,Howard>我支持莱纳德
<12-15,Howard>I'm with Leonard.

359
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,510
<12-15,Howard>我受够了
<12-15,Howard>I'm done.

360
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,150
<12-16,Raj>好吧  那看来是二对二了
<12-16,Raj>Fine, then I guess it's two against two.

361
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,550
<12-16,Raj>怎么决定
<12-16,Raj>How do we decide?

362
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,680
<12-17,Sheldon>事实上  是三对一
<12-17,Sheldon>Actually, it's three against one.

363
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,560
<12-17,Sheldon>什么
<12-17,Sheldon>What?!

364
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,960
<12-18,Raj>那任务怎么办
<12-18,Raj>What about the mission?

365
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,790
<12-18,Raj>是你说我们是现实中的先遣登陆队
<12-18,Raj>You said we were a real-life landing party.

366
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,190
<12-18,Raj>我们不是
<12-18,Raj>Yeah, well, we're not.

367
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,940
<12-19,Sheldon>我们是幻想的先遣登陆队
<12-19,Sheldon>We're an imaginary landing party

368
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,860
<12-19,Sheldon>在现实中被人丢垃圾
<12-19,Sheldon>who had real-life garbage thrown at us

369
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,400
<12-19,Sheldon>现实中陌生人认为我们是白痴
<12-19,Sheldon>by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.

370
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,140
<12-19,Sheldon>跟你说实话
<12-19,Sheldon>And to tell you the truth,

371
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,440
<12-19,Sheldon>我开始觉得自己像白痴了
<12-19,Sheldon>I'm starting to feel like one.

372
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,930
<12-19,Sheldon>我现在就想回家
<12-19,Sheldon>I want to go home now.

373
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,520
<12-20,Raj>好吧
<12-20,Raj>Okay.

374
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,610
<12-20,Raj>那我们好歹从进取公司租车吧
<12-20,Raj>Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise?

376
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,110
<12-20,Raj>懂吗  进取号哟
<12-20,Raj>Get it? Enterprise?

377
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,650
<12-20,Raj>去死吧  明明很好笑
<12-20,Raj>Screw you. That's funny.

378
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,680
<13-1,Bernadette>那绿巨人在雷神举着锤子时
<13-1,Bernadette>Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor

379
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,730
<13-1,Bernadette>把他连人带锤举起来  那会怎么样
<13-1,Bernadette>while Thor is holding the hammer?

380
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,520
<13-2,Amy>会怎样
<13-2,Amy>Yeah?

381
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
<13-3,Bernadette>这样根据传递性质
<13-3,Bernadette>Then by the transitive property of picking things up,

382
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,860
<13-4,Amy>就是绿巨人举起了锤子
<13-4,Amy>Hulk picked up the hammer.

383
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,060
<13-4,Amy>不
<13-4,Amy>No.

384
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,450
<13-4,Amy>是绿巨人举起了雷神  雷神举起了锤子
<13-4,Amy>Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.

385
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,460
<13-4,Amy>等等
<13-4,Amy>Okay, hang on.

386
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,380
<13-5,Penny>如果我去酒吧勾搭[举起]了一个男的
<13-5,Penny>If I go to a bar and pick up a guy,

387
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,940
<13-5,Penny>他又勾搭了一个女的  然后我们仨一起离开
<13-5,Penny>and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together,

388
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,000
<13-5,Penny>那那个女的算是我勾搭上的吗
<13-5,Penny>did I pick up the girl?

389
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,340
<13-6,Amy>这是真事吗
<13-6,Amy>Did that ever happen?

390
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,530
<13-7,Penny>喂  是讨论我还是讨论雷神啊
<13-7,Penny>Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?

391
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,900
<14-1,Sheldon>要我说  这是我们最后一次出门
<14-1,Sheldon>Well, I say that's the last time we ever go outside.

392
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,030
<14-2,Amy (off)>看这里
<14-2,Amy (off)>Look, right here.

393
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,860
<14-2,Amy (off)>红巨人举起了雷神的锤子
<14-2,Amy (off)>Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer

394
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,750
<14-2,Amy (off)>因为雷神拿着锤子
<14-2,Amy (off)>'cause Thor's touching it.

395
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,020
<14-3,Penny (off)>不  因为他们在外太空
<14-3,Penny (off)>No, it's because they're in space.

396
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,710
<14-3,Penny (off)>而且他只是碰到了带子
<14-3,Penny (off)>He's really just touching the strap.

397
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,980
<14-4,Amy(off)>带子是锤子的一部分
<14-4,Amy(off)>The strap is part of the hammer!

398
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,020
<14-5,Bernadette (off)>不是的
<14-5,Bernadette (off)>No, it's not!

399
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,370
<14-6,Raj>她们是在争论漫画书的内容吗
<14-6,Raj>Are they actually arguing about comic books?

400
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,190
<14-7,Leonard>不  这不可能是真的
<14-7,Leonard>No, that can't be right.

401
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,880
<14-8,Howard>也许"雷神之锤"
<14-8,Howard>Maybe "Thor's Hammer"

402
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,520
<14-8,Howard>是新的指甲油颜色
<14-8,Howard>is a new color of nail polish.

403
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,460
<14-9,Bernadette (off)>红巨人肯定是配得上锤子
<14-9,Bernadette (off)>Then Red Hulk must be worthy.

404
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,530
<14-10,Penny (off)>红巨人怎么配得上啊
<14-10,Penny (off)>How could Red Hulk be worthy?

405
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,600
<14-11,Bernadette (off)>你又不了解他的生平
<14-11,Bernadette (off)>You don't know his life!

406
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,190
<14-12,Sheldon>只有一个合理的解释了
<14-12,Sheldon>There's only one logical explanation.

407
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,790
<14-12,Sheldon>在沙漠的某处
<14-12,Sheldon>Somewhere in the desert

408
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,700
<14-12,Sheldon>我们穿越到另一个平行空间了
<14-12,Sheldon>we crossed into an alternate dimension...

409
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,140
<14-12,Sheldon>在这个空间  我们生活中的女性
<14-12,Sheldon>where the women in our lives

410
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,840
<14-12,Sheldon>终于懂得欣赏真正的伟大著作了
<14-12,Sheldon>can finally appreciate great literature.

411
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,650
<14-13,Raj>如果这是平行空间
<14-13,Raj>If it's an alternate dimension...

412
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,820
<14-13,Raj>听起来先遣登陆队可以执行任务了
<14-13,Raj>sounds like a job for a landing party.

413
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,690
<14-14,Sheldon>舰长  有何指令
<14-14,Sheldon>Captain, what are your orders?

414
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,500
<14-15,Leonard>我看我们要调查一番
<14-15,Leonard>I say we investigate.

415
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,470
<14-16,Sheldon>等等
<14-16,Sheldon>Wait.

416
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
<14-16,Sheldon>她们可能有攻击性
<14-16,Sheldon>They might be hostile.

417
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,770
<14-17,Leonard>好吧  不过调成击晕模式
<14-17,Leonard>Fine, but set them to stun.

418
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,180
<14-17,Leonard>如果把佩妮汽化了
<14-17,Leonard>If we vaporize Penny,

419
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,100
<14-17,Leonard>我上哪儿再去找这么正点的女朋友呀
<14-17,Leonard>I'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.

420
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,880
<15-1,GPS>有趣的事实
<15-1,GPS>Fun fact:

421
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,770
<15-1,GPS>艾森豪威尔总统是在病房里签署的
<15-1,GPS>President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act

422
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,230
<15-1,GPS>《联邦政府助建公路条例》
<15-1,GPS>from his hospital room.

423
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,360
<15-2,First Car Thief>还真的很有意思啊
<15-2,First Car Thief>Wow, that is interesting.

424
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,980
<15-3,Second Car Thief>每天都能学到新知识
<15-3,Second Car Thief>You learn something new every day.

425
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,180
<15-4,GPS>那么  你能说出是哪四个州府
<15-4,GPS>Say, can you name the four state capitols

426
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,210
<15-4,GPS>没有通州际公路吗
<15-4,GPS>that are not served by the interstate system?

427
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,420
<15-5,First Car Thief>又来道智力题  爽
<15-5,First Car Thief>Ooh, another quiz. Yes!
