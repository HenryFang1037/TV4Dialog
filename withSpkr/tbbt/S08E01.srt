18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,990
<4-1,Sheldon>打扰一下
<4-1,Sheldon>Excuse me.

19
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,840
<1-1,Sheldon>有没有可能
<1-1,Sheldon>Is it at all possible

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,910
<1-1,Sheldon>你现在打的是毛线裤呢
<1-1,Sheldon>that you're knitting a pair of pants?

21
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,250
<1-1,Sheldon>别走  你感到害怕是可以理解的
<1-1,Sheldon>Oh, well, no, you're understandably terrified.

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,320
<1-1,Sheldon>但请给我个机会解释
<1-1,Sheldon>But, you know, allow me to explain.

23
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,640
<1-1,Sheldon>45天前  我开启了一段
<1-1,Sheldon>45 days ago, um, I embarked on

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,530
<1-1,Sheldon>心灵疗伤铁路之旅
<1-1,Sheldon>a railroad journey of healing

25
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,130
<1-1,Sheldon>因为当时我的大学
<1-1,Sheldon>because my university

26
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,640
<1-1,Sheldon>逼我研究弦理论
<1-1,Sheldon>was making me do string theory,

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,860
<1-1,Sheldon>而我最喜爱的漫画店发生了火灾
<1-1,Sheldon>and my favorite comic book store burned down,

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,910
<1-1,Sheldon>我的室友还订婚了
<1-1,Sheldon>and when my roommate got engaged,

29
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,880
<1-1,Sheldon>而我女朋友想搬进来跟我同居
<1-1,Sheldon>my girlfriend wanted to move in with me,

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,940
<1-1,Sheldon>而那明显是幌子  她的目的...
<1-1,Sheldon>which was no doubt a ploy just to see my--

31
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,100
<1-1,Sheldon>抱歉失礼了  是染指我小裤裤里的东西
<1-1,Sheldon>well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts.

32
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,260
<1-1,Sheldon>先生  能借用一下电话吗
<1-1,Sheldon>Uh, sir, may I use your phone?

33
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,250
<1-2,Man>-恐怕不能  -好吧
<1-2,Man>- I don't think so. - Yeah, well,

34
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,930
<1-3,Sheldon>我知道我现在是半裸的
<1-3,Sheldon>I understand that I'm half naked,

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,910
<1-3,Sheldon>但是我有个合理的解释
<1-3,Sheldon>but there is a reasonable explanation.

36
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,540
<1-3,Sheldon>我在火车卧铺上睡觉时
<1-3,Sheldon>While I slept in my sleeper car,

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,490
<1-3,Sheldon>东西全被偷走了
<1-3,Sheldon>all my possessions were stolen.

38
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,930
<1-3,Sheldon>通常来说  我都会穿睡裤
<1-3,Sheldon>Now, typically, I wear pajamas,

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,880
<1-3,Sheldon>但最近我习惯了流浪汉的生活方式
<1-3,Sheldon>but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,330
<1-3,Sheldon>而睡裤是普通人穿来睡觉的
<1-3,Sheldon>and pajamas are the sleep-pants of the man.

41
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,520
<1-3,Sheldon>我告诉你  圣雄甘地也没穿裤子
<1-3,Sheldon>I'll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,820
<1-3,Sheldon>全印度还不是团结起来支持他
<1-3,Sheldon>and a nation rallied behind him!

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,410
<1-3,Sheldon>老兄
<1-3,Sheldon>My good man...

44
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,580
<1-3,Sheldon>在你走之前
<1-3,Sheldon>Now, before you walk away...

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,430
<1-3,Sheldon>我想说我可能看起来像疯子
<1-3,Sheldon>I know that I may appear deranged,

46
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,130
<1-3,Sheldon>但其实我是一个世界闻名的物理学家
<1-3,Sheldon>but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist.

47
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,200
<1-3,Sheldon>不信你问我玻色子跟费米子的差异
<1-3,Sheldon>Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion.

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,760
<1-3,Sheldon>来啊  你问吧
<1-3,Sheldon>Go ahead, ask!

49
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,300
<1-3,Sheldon>玻色子自旋为整数
<1-3,Sheldon>Bosons have integer spin,

50
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,470
<1-3,Sheldon>费米子自旋为半整数
<1-3,Sheldon>fermions have half-integer spin!

51
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,960
<1-3,Sheldon>我的腿好冷
<1-3,Sheldon>My legs are getting cold!

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,150
<1-3,Sheldon>为什么没人帮帮我呢
<1-3,Sheldon>Why won't anybody help me?

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,680
<2-1,Leonard>早安
<2-1,Leonard>Morning.

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,500
<2-2,Penny>想跟我一起做瑜伽吗
<2-2,Penny>Hi. Want to do yoga with me?

61
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,540
<2-3,Leonard>让我先喝杯咖啡
<2-3,Leonard>Um, let me just have some coffee first,

62
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,000
<2-3,Leonard>我才有力气告诉你
<2-3,Leonard>and then I'll have the strength to tell you

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,070
<2-3,Leonard>我超级不想做瑜伽
<2-3,Leonard>how much I won't be doing that.

64
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,790
<2-4,Sheldon>你好

<3-1,Raj>Thanks for the lift.

111
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,590
<3-2,Howard>你的车怎么了
<3-2,Howard>What's wrong with your car?

112
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,670
<3-3,Raj>我把车送去弄掉防晒膜了
<3-3,Raj>I'm having my windows untinted.

113
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,730
<3-4,Howard>为什么
<3-4,Howard>Why?

114
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,700
<3-5,Raj>现在有个辣妹女友
<3-5,Raj>Got a hot girlfriend now.

115
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,930
<3-5,Raj>得秀给嫉妒的屌丝们看看啊
<3-5,Raj>I want the haters to know.

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,220
<3-6,Howard>你在瞎说什么啊
<3-6,Howard>What are you talking about?

117
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,130
<3-6,Howard>才没人会鸟你咧
<3-6,Howard>No one's paying attention to you.

118
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,910
<3-7,Raj>嫉妒水的滋味可好  兄弟
<3-7,Raj>How's that Hater-ade taste, bro?

119
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,680
<3-7,Raj>这不是上班的路啊
<3-7,Raj>Hey, this isn't the way to work.

120
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,820
<3-8,Howard>我想经过我妈家  看看她好不好
<3-8,Howard>I just want to pop in and make sure Ma's okay.

121
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,520
<3-9,Raj>斯图尔特不是在照顾她吗
<3-9,Raj>I thought Stuart was looking after her.

122
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,040
<3-10,Howard>本来是  我妈石膏拆了后  他就搬了
<3-10,Howard>He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out.

123
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,360
<3-10,Howard>老实说  我挺高兴的
<3-10,Howard>And honestly, I'm kind of glad.

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,010
<3-10,Howard>他们俩后来有点怪怪的
<3-10,Howard>It was getting a little weird.

125
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,220
<3-11,Raj>怎么怪
<3-11,Raj>How so?

126
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,360
<3-12,Howard>我不会说  他们...
<3-12,Howard>I don't know, they're...

127
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,920
<3-12,Howard>很亲密
<3-12,Howard>chummy.

128
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,860
<3-13,Raj>像我们这样吗
<3-13,Raj>Like us?

129
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,230
<3-14,Howard>不  跟我们不一样
<3-14,Howard>No, not like us.

130
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,510
<3-14,Howard>是恶心的那种亲密
<3-14,Howard>Creepy chummy,

131
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,250
<3-14,Howard>就像你和你的狗
<3-14,Howard>like you and your dog.

132
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,950
<3-15,Raj>你妈妈亲自用嘴给他喂食吗
<3-15,Raj>She feeds him out of her own mouth?

133
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,600
<3-16,Howard>我是说  他叫我妈黛比
<3-16,Howard>I mean, he calls her Debbie,

134
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,320
<3-16,Howard>我妈叫他图仔
<3-16,Howard>she calls him Stewie

135
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,610
<3-16,Howard>他们整天两个人黏一起傻笑
<3-16,Howard>and they're all giggly around each other.

136
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,040
<3-16,Howard>相信我  任何食物只要一到我妈嘴里
<3-16,Howard>And believe me, when food goes in that mouth,

137
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,270
<3-16,Howard>就只进不出了
<3-16,Howard>it does not come out.

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,180
<3-17,Raj>所以你是担心
<3-17,Raj>So are you worried

139
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,900
<3-17,Raj>他要取代你儿子的位置
<3-17,Raj>because he's replacing you as a son

140
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,770
<3-17,Raj>还是担心他会成为你妈妈的情人
<3-17,Raj>or are you worried because he's becoming her lover?

141
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,310
<3-18,Howard>首先没人能取代我儿子的位置
<3-18,Howard>First of all, no one can replace me as a son.

142
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,330
<3-18,Howard>我是我妈的宝贝小汤丸
<3-18,Howard>I'm her little matzo ball.

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,170
<3-18,Howard>其次  我妈这么大年纪
<3-18,Howard>And secondly, my mother is well past

144
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,580
<3-18,Howard>早就跟性生活无缘了
<3-18,Howard>having any kind of sex life.

145
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,310
<3-19,Raj>好吧
<3-19,Raj>Okay, okay.

146
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,100
<3-19,Raj>其实有很多老年女性仍过着活力四射的...
<3-19,Raj>Although many older women lead vibrant, active...

147
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,230
<3-20,Howard>我说无缘就是无缘
<3-20,Howard>I said well past it!

148
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,340
<4-1,Sheldon>请问一下  赫尔南德斯警官
<4-1,Sheldon>Excuse me, Officer Hernandez?

149
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,490
<4-1,Sheldon>有任何偷我东西的贼的线索了吗
<4-1,Sheldon>Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?

150
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,160
<4-2,Hernandez>还没
<4-2,Hernandez>Not yet.

151
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,840
<4-3,Sheldon>或许我可以帮忙
<4-3,Sheldon>Well, perhaps I can help.

152
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,950
<4-3,Sheldon>神探福尔摩斯曾说过
<4-3,Sheldon>Sherlock Holmes always says

153
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,750
<4-3,Sheldon>排除所有不可能因素
<4-3,Sheldon>when you eliminate the impossible,

154
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,040
<4-3,Sheldon>剩下的即使再不合理
<4-3,Sheldon>whatever remains, however improbable,

155
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,340
<4-3,Sheldon>必然是事实的真相
<4-3,Sheldon>must be the truth.

156
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,320
<4-3,Sheldon>你试过这么做吗
<4-3,Sheldon>Now, have-have you tried doing that?

157
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,710
<4-4,Hernandez>没有
<4-4,Hernandez>Nope.

158
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,520
<4-5,Sheldon>或许你该试试
<4-5,Sheldon>Well, maybe you should.

159
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,840
<4-5,Sheldon>世上有很多叫《神探福尔摩斯》的书
<4-5,Sheldon>Th-Th-There's lots of books called "Sherlock Holmes"

160
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,850
<4-5,Sheldon>而却没有一本叫《神警赫尔南德斯》
<4-5,Sheldon>and there's no books called "Officer Hernandez."

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
<5-1,Leonard>谢谢你来陪我
<5-1,Leonard>Thanks again for coming.

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,760
<5-1,Leonard>我一个人开六个小时的车实在太漫长了
<5-1,Leonard>Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.

163
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,070
<5-2,Amy>我的荣幸
<5-2,Amy>My pleasure.

164
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,130
<5-2,Amy>而且我一点也不气
<5-2,Amy>And I'm not angry at all

165
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,480
<5-2,Amy>我男朋友落难时  居然打给你而不是我
<5-2,Amy>that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me.

166
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,110
<5-2,Amy>真是太好了
<5-2,Amy>I love that!

167
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,420
<5-3,Leonard>好吧  这六小时一定过得"飞快"
<5-3,Leonard>Yeah, time's gonna fly by.

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,060
<5-3,Leonard>我好几年没去面试了
<5-3,Leonard>I haven't been on a job interview in years.

169
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,190
<5-3,Leonard>我真的好紧张
<5-3,Leonard>I'm really nervous.

170
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,230
<6-1,Penny>别紧张
<6-1,Penny>Don't be.

171
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,110
<6-2,Bernadette>你天生就是干医药销售这行的
<6-2,Bernadette>You are built for pharmaceutical sales.

172
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,980
<6-2,Bernadette>你可爱  轻浮而且...
<6-2,Bernadette>You're cute, you're flirty and...

173
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,620
<6-2,Bernadette>本来以为会有三个优点说呢...
<6-2,Bernadette>Started that like there were gonna be three things.

174
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,080
<6-3,Penny>我没有任何销售经验
<6-3,Penny>I don't have any experience in sales.

175
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,230
<6-3,Penny>除非我在高中时穿着比基尼洗车也算
<6-3,Penny>Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school.

176
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,030
<6-3,Penny>但你叫我把这段从我简历上删掉了
<6-3,Penny>But you already made me take that off my resume?

177
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,350
<6-4,Bernadette>这份工作其实跟服务生很像
<6-4,Bernadette>This job is a lot like being a waitress,

178
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,350
<6-4,Bernadette>只不过你不是给客人推销
<6-4,Bernadette>except instead of pushing the fish tacos

179
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,600
<6-4,Bernadette>快变质的鱼肉玉米卷
<6-4,Bernadette>'cause they're about to go bad,

180
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
<6-4,Bernadette>你是推销我们的抗抑郁药
<6-4,Bernadette>you're just pushing our antidepressants

182
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,350
<6-4,Bernadette>在FDA发现这药能引起直肠出血之前赶紧卖掉
<6-4,Bernadette>before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.

183
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,720
<6-5,Penny>是真的吗
<6-5,Penny>They do?

184
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,770
<6-5,Penny>或许吧
<6-5,Penny>Maybe.

185
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,890
<6-6,Bernadette>但就像我们律师说的  这世界上有很多东西
<6-6,Bernadette>But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things

186
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,110
<6-6,Bernadette>能导致直肠出血
<6-6,Bernadette>that can cause a rectum to bleed.

187
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,520
<6-6,Bernadette>我在丹面前帮你说了不少好话
<6-6,Bernadette>Anyway, I talked you up to Dan.

188
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,050
<6-6,Bernadette>他就是面试你的那个人
<6-6,Bernadette>He's the guy who'll be interviewing you.

189
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,450
<6-7,Penny>真是太谢谢你了
<6-7,Penny>Oh, I really appreciate this.

190
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,160
<6-7,Penny>我只希望我到时不会手足无措
<6-7,Penny>I just hope I'm not in over my head.

191
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,090
<6-8,Bernadette>没事的  就跟平时一样表现自己
<6-8,Bernadette>You'll be fine. Just be yourself.

192
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,730
<6-9,Penny>-我真希望我能多点自信  -佩妮
<6-9,Penny>- I wish I felt more confident. - Penny,

193
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,290
<6-10,Bernadette>如果我觉得你不能胜任这份工作
<6-10,Bernadette>I wouldn't have put you up for this job

194
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,530
<6-10,Bernadette>我就不会推荐你
<6-10,Bernadette>if I didn't think you could handle it.

195
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,830
<6-11,Penny>谢谢  但或许我该取消面试
<6-11,Penny>Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.

196
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,730
<6-12,Bernadette>现在取消太晚了  你一定要去
<6-12,Bernadette>It's too late to cancel. You're going.

197
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,570
<6-13,Penny>但我对医药没有任何了解
<6-13,Penny>But I don't know anything about pharmaceuticals.

198
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,000
<6-14,Bernadette>我明白了
<6-14,Bernadette>Oh, I understand.

199
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,640
<6-14,Bernadette>你想从事你擅长的工作
<6-14,Bernadette>You want to do something you're already good at.

200
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,420
<6-14,Bernadette>我懂
<6-14,Bernadette>I know.

201
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,330
<6-14,Bernadette>那我何不帮你在
<6-14,Bernadette>Why don't I get you a job at

202
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,000
<6-14,Bernadette>"穿着瑜伽裤宅在家工厂"找一份工作呢
<6-14,Bernadette>the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?

203
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,080
<6-15,Penny>那裤子真的很舒服嘛
<6-15,Penny>They're comfortable.

204
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,570
<7-1,Howard>妈  把衣服穿好  拉杰也在哦
<7-1,Howard>Ma, I hope you're decent. Raj is here!

205
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,920
<7-1,Howard>你最近才开始重新看见女人裸体
<7-1,Howard>You just started seeing naked women again,

206
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,260
<7-1,Howard>我不想让你对咪咪
<7-1,Howard>and I don't want you to be confused

207
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,040
<7-1,Howard>到底该垂到哪儿感到困惑
<7-1,Howard>about where the boobs should be.

208
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,390
<7-2,Stuart>你们好啊
<7-2,Stuart>Oh, hey, guys.

209
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,590
<7-2,Stuart>你们怎么会来这里
<7-2,Stuart>What are you doing here?

210
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,050
<7-2,Stuart>那你又怎么在这里
<7-2,Stuart>Uh... w-what are you doing here?

211
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,170
<7-3,Howard>我以为你搬出去了
<7-3,Howard>I thought you moved out.

212
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,100
<7-4,Stuart>我本来打算搬的
<7-4,Stuart>Oh, yeah, I was going to,

213
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,880
<7-4,Stuart>但某天晚上  我和黛比
<7-4,Stuart>and then Debbie and I got to talking

214
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,200
<7-4,Stuart>在吃饭时聊到这事
<7-4,Stuart>over dinner the other night.

215
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,730
<7-4,Stuart>我没有住的地方
<7-4,Stuart>I didn't have anyplace to go,

216
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,170
<7-4,Stuart>她也喜欢我待在这里
<7-4,Stuart>she likes having me around,

217
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,390
<7-4,Stuart>所以我俩异口同声说"那为什么还要搬"
<7-4,Stuart>so we both said, "Why leave?" at the same time.

218
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,400
<7-6,Raj>无比珍贵的一段回忆啊
<7-6,Raj>It was precious.

219
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,580
<7-5,Howard>也没那么珍贵吧
<7-5,Howard>It's not that precious.

220
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,120
<7-6,Raj>我本来想支持你的
<7-6,Raj>I'd like to back you up,

221
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,840
<7-6,Raj>但听起来的确弥足珍贵
<7-6,Raj>but it sounds like it was pretty precious.

222
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,800
<7-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>图仔  我找不到眼镜了
<7-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Stewie, I can't find my glasses!

223
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,320
<7-8,Stuart>马上来  小黛黛
<7-8,Stuart>Be right there, Deb Deb!

224
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,830
<7-8,Stuart>眼镜可能就在她头上
<7-8,Stuart>They're probably on her head.

225
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,310
<7-9,Howard>或者在她脖子的肉里  听着
<7-9,Howard>Or in her neck. Listen.

226
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,110
<7-9,Howard>你留在这里住这件事
<7-9,Howard>You staying here seems like something

227
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,170
<7-9,Howard>她应该会跟我说一声啊
<7-9,Howard>she would've talked to me about.

228
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,100
<7-10,Stuart>如果你经常给你母亲打电话  你早知道了
<7-10,Stuart>Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you'd know.

229
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,910
<7-11,Raj>打电话回家又不会少块肉
<7-11,Raj>It wouldn't kill you to pick up the phone.

230
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,360
<8-1,Sheldon>我被偷的物品有消息了吗
<8-1,Sheldon>Any word on my stolen items?

231
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,230
<8-2,Hernandez>我们在尽一切努力帮你找
<8-2,Hernandez>We're doing everything we can.

<8-3,Sheldon>神探福尔摩斯
<8-3,Sheldon>You know, Sherlock Holmes

233
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,680
<8-3,Sheldon>喜欢用可卡因来让自己集中注意力
<8-3,Sheldon>liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus.

234
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,470
<8-3,Sheldon>但我确定膨化垃圾食品对你也有同样功效
<8-3,Sheldon>But I'm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.

235
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,250
<8-4,Leonard>谢尔顿
<8-4,Leonard>Sheldon.

236

<8-6,Amy>-你没事吧  -没事
<8-6,Amy>- Are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine.

239
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,910
<8-7,Sheldon>你怎么来了
<8-7,Sheldon>Why did you come?

240
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,560
<8-8,Amy>你这话什么意思
<8-8,Amy>What do you mean, why did I come?

241
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,340
<8-8,Amy>你是我的男朋友
<8-8,Amy>You're my boyfriend.

242
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,220
<8-8,Amy>我们超过一个月没有见面了
<8-8,Amy>I haven't seen you in over a month.

<8-8,Amy>我开了六个小时的车过来接你
<8-8,Amy>I just drove six hours to help you out.

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,480
<8-8,Amy>你除了说"你怎么来了"
<8-8,Amy>Don't you have anything to say besides,

245

247
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,400
<8-9,Sheldon>在这么多警察叔叔面前大声说出来
<8-9,Sheldon>I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud

248
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,820
<8-9,Sheldon>我觉得不太妥
<8-9,Sheldon>in front of these police officers.

249
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,820
<8-10,Amy>好
<8-10,Amy>Fine.

<9-8,Sheldon>也没吃过一片水果
<9-8,Sheldon>Or had a single piece of fruit.

266
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,530
<9-8,Sheldon>所以
<9-8,Sheldon>So...

267

272
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,120
<10-2,Penny>我好像提太多"人"这个字了
<10-2,Penny>I feel like I'm saying "people" a lot.

279
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,710
<10-6,Penny>作为服务员  我的工作很大一部分就是推销
<10-6,Penny>Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job.

280
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,300
<10-6,Penny>相信我  我说服了很多
<10-6,Penny>I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers,

281
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,770
<10-6,Penny>不该吃芝士蛋糕的胖子顾客
<10-6,Penny>who should not be eating cheesecake,

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,610
<10-6,Penny>狂吃我们的芝士蛋糕
<10-6,Penny>to have more cheesecake.

283
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,240
<10-6,Penny>而且
<10-6,Penny>I mean,

284
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,850
<10-6,Penny>其中某个胖胖还带着胰岛素泵呢
<10-6,Penny>one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump!

285
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,410
<10-7,Dan>我也有胰岛素泵[糖尿病]
<10-7,Dan>I have an insulin pump.

286
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,220
<10-7,Dan>人嘛
<10-7,Dan>People.

287
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,370
<11-1,Howard>感觉很怪吧
<11-1,Howard>It's weird, right?

288
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,740
<11-1,Howard>30多岁的成年人还跟我妈住在一起
<11-1,Howard>A grown man in his 30s living with my mother.

289
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,070
<11-2,Raj>的确很奇怪
<11-2,Raj>That is weird.

290
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,540
<11-2,Raj>我以为他都45岁了
<11-2,Raj>I thought he was, like, 45.

291
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,880
<11-3,Howard>拜托  你难道不觉得这很奇怪吗
<11-3,Howard>Come on, you don't think it's a little odd?

292
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,370
<11-4,Raj>我不知道  她那么孤单
<11-4,Raj>I don't know! I mean, she's lonely.

293
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,830
<11-4,Raj>他又需要地方住
<11-4,Raj>He needs a place to stay.

294
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,820
<11-4,Raj>我想他们之间肯定没什么
<11-4,Raj>I doubt there's any funny business going on.

295
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,420
<11-4,Raj>就算有  那又怎样
<11-4,Raj>And even if there was, who cares?

296
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,460
<11-4,Raj>他们都是成年人了
<11-4,Raj>They're both adults.

297
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,900
<11-5,Howard>"那又怎样"  要是我和你妈睡了
<11-5,Howard>"Who cares"?! You wouldn't care

298
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,990
<11-5,Howard>你也不会觉得怎么样吗
<11-5,Howard>if I slept with your mom?

299
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,790
<11-6,Raj>知道吗  你是我的好基友
<11-6,Raj>You know what? You're my best friend,

<11-6,Raj>and she's in a bad marriage.

301
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,110
<11-6,Raj>我祝福你们
<11-6,Raj>I give you my blessing.

302
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,260
<11-7,Howard>这样做太傻了
<11-7,Howard>This is stupid.

303
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,790
<11-7,Howard>我还是打电话给我妈  告诉她实话
<11-7,Howard>I'm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.

304
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,410
<11-8,Raj>这才是宝贝小汤丸该做的事
<11-8,Raj>'Cause that's what little matzo balls do.

00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,660
<12-1,Dan>我们竞争对手的药

<12-1,Dan>你要如何说服他转用我们的药呢
<12-1,Dan>How would you convince them to switch to ours?

<12-4,Penny>and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview?

320
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,390
<12-4,Penny>她肯定会生气
<12-4,Penny>She'll get upset.

321
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,840
<12-4,Penny>老实说  我真有点怕她
<12-4,Penny>And honestly I'm a... a little terrified of her.

324
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,520
<12-7,Dan>我以为只有我怕她呢
<12-7,Dan>I thought it was just me!

<12-7,Dan>每个人都觉得她特好
<12-7,Dan>E-Everyone thinks she's so nice

326
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,010
<12-7,Dan>说话声音细细的尖尖的
<12-7,Dan>with that squeaky little voice.

327
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,700
<12-8,Penny>我懂  可她其实是个恶霸
<12-8,Penny>I know, but she's kind of a bully!

328
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,260
<12-9,Dan>没有错
<12-9,Dan>She is!

329
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,170
<12-9,Dan>我本来不想见你的
<12-9,Dan>I-I didn't even want to meet you,

330
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,710
<12-9,Dan>可我不敢开口拒绝她
<12-9,Dan>but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,490
<12-10,Penny>我也是
<12-10,Penny>Me, too!

332

<12-11,Dan>对吧  对吧  有一次  我...
<12-11,Dan>Yeah, yeah! One-one time, I had...

333
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,670
<12-11,Dan>我本来要告诉她
<12-11,Dan>Oh! I had to tell her

334
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,260
<12-11,Dan>我们要削减她正在研发的
<12-11,Dan>we were cutting the-the research funding

<12-12,Penny>结果呢
<12-12,Penny>What happened?

337
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,940
<12-12,Penny>我根本开不了口
<12-12,Penny>I couldn't do it!

338
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,420
<12-13,Dan>她现在还在研究呢
<12-13,Dan>She's still working on it!

339
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,240
<12-13,Dan>这件事你不会说出去吧
<12-13,Dan>We're not gonna tell her about this, right?

340
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,490
<12-14,Penny>-我的天  当然不会  -绝不
<12-14,Penny>- Oh, my God, no! - No, no...

<13-3,Sheldon>准备好玩猜芥末酱的游戏了吗
<13-3,Sheldon>You ready to move on to the mustard round?

350
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,800
<13-4,Amy>你难道没觉察到我这两个小时
<13-4,Amy>Have you not noticed that I've been sitting back here

351
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,080
<13-4,Amy>一直默默地坐在后面吗
<13-4,Amy>quietly stewing for the past two hours?

352
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,090
<13-5,Sheldon>我以为你只是很不会猜呢
<13-5,Sheldon>I just thought you were bad at the game.

353
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,060
<13-6,Amy>我是在生你的气
<13-6,Amy>I'm mad at you!

354
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,010
<13-6,Amy>你怎么能就这样
<13-6,Amy>How could you just go away like that

355
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,360
<13-6,Amy>不告而别地走掉
<13-6,Amy>without even saying good-bye,

356
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,110
<13-6,Amy>然后打电话给莱纳德求助  却不来找我
<13-6,Amy>and then call Leonard for help instead of me?

357
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,950
<13-6,Amy>艾米
<13-6,Amy>Amy?

358
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,940
<13-7,Sheldon>可以让我和我的室友
<13-7,Sheldon>May I please have a moment of privacy

359
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,320
<13-7,Sheldon>说几句悄悄话吗
<13-7,Sheldon>to speak with my roommate?

360
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,060
<13-8,Amy>我们可是在飞驰的车上
<13-8,Amy>We're in a moving car!

361
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,500
<13-8,Amy>你想要我怎么做
<13-8,Amy>What do you expect me to do?

362
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,790
<13-8,Amy>用手指塞住耳朵吗
<13-8,Amy>Stick my fingers in my ears?

363
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,760
<13-9,Sheldon>我是打算让你像狗一样把头伸出窗外
<13-9,Sheldon>Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog,

364
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,230
<13-9,Sheldon>但塞耳朵也行啦
<13-9,Sheldon>but that'll work.

365
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,040
<13-9,Sheldon>拜托了  很快就好
<13-9,Sheldon>Please? This'll be quick.

366
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,010
<13-9,Sheldon>莱纳德
<13-9,Sheldon>Leonard?

367
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,940
<13-9,Sheldon>我们一到家
<13-9,Sheldon>As soon as we get home,

368
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,650
<13-9,Sheldon>我就要和艾米发生性关系
<13-9,Sheldon>I want to have coitus with Amy.

369
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,480
<13-9,Sheldon>好的  看来她是听不到
<13-9,Sheldon>Okay, she can't hear.

370
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
<13-9,Sheldon>我之所以打电话给你
<13-9,Sheldon>The reason I called you

371
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,420
<13-9,Sheldon>是因为我不想艾米知道
<13-9,Sheldon>is because I didn't want Amy

372
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,470
<13-9,Sheldon>我无法在外独立生存
<13-9,Sheldon>to know I couldn't make it on my own.

373
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,320
<13-10,Leonard>这有什么
<13-10,Leonard>What's the big deal?

374
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,740
<13-11,Sheldon>当然这对你来说不算什么
<13-11,Sheldon>Oh, of course it's no big deal to you.

375
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,180
<13-11,Sheldon>你视我为偶像  你把我供在神台上
<13-11,Sheldon>You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me

376
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,450
<13-11,Sheldon>没什么可以让我从神台上下来
<13-11,Sheldon>off that pedestal you put me on.

377
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,260
<13-12,Leonard>没错
<13-12,Leonard>Well, yeah, it's true.

378
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,320
<13-12,Leonard>你对我是神一般的存在
<13-12,Leonard>You-you are a god to me.

379
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,210
<13-13,Amy>我可以听了吗
<13-13,Amy>Can I stop now?

380
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,980
<13-14,Leonard>告诉她吧
<13-14,Leonard>Just tell her.

381
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,980
<13-15,Sheldon>我打电话给莱纳德是因为
<13-15,Sheldon>I called Leonard because...

382
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,110
<13-15,Sheldon>我失败了
<13-15,Sheldon>I failed.

383
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,390
<13-15,Sheldon>我不希望你因此轻视我
<13-15,Sheldon>And I didn't want you to think less of me.

384
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,970
<13-16,Amy>你是担心这个吗
<13-16,Amy>You were worried about that?

385
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,750
<13-17,Sheldon>是的
<13-17,Sheldon>Yes.

386
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,280
<13-17,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<13-17,Sheldon>Sheldon...

387
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,560
<13-18,Amy>你并不完美的事实  我是可以接受的
<13-18,Amy>it's okay with me that you're not perfect.

388
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,790
<13-19,Sheldon>我能再和莱纳德说句悄悄话吗
<13-19,Sheldon>Can I have one more moment with Leonard?

389
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,870
<13-20,Amy>好的
<13-20,Amy>Sure.

390
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,650
<13-21,Sheldon>艾米伤了我的心  我要和她分手
<13-21,Sheldon>Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.

391
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,620
<14-1,Howard>我没想过我会这样说
<14-1,Howard>Now, I never thought I'd say this,

392
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,270
<14-1,Howard>但能见到谢尔顿了  我还有些小激动呢
<14-1,Howard>but I'm kind of excited to see Sheldon.

393
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,210
<14-2,Bernadette>我没想过我会这样说  但佩妮今天找到工作了
<14-2,Bernadette>I never thought I'd say this, but Penny got a job today.

394
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,380
<14-3,Howard>是吗
<14-3,Howard>She did?

395
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,990
<14-4,Bernadette>她成功的唯一原因
<14-4,Bernadette>Well, the only reason she got it

396
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,750
<14-4,Bernadette>是因为面试她的人爱慕我
<14-4,Bernadette>is 'cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.

397
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,190
<14-5,Howard (answering a knock on the door)>你想怎样
<14-5,Howard (answering a knock on the door)>What do you want?

398
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,680
<14-6,Stuart>我大概感觉到
<14-6,Stuart>I, uh, kind of got the feeling

399
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,800
<14-6,Stuart>你对我住在你妈家有意见
<14-6,Stuart>you might not be okay with me staying at your mom's.

400
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,310
<14-7,Howard>你说得对  我有意见
<14-7,Howard>You're right, I'm not.

401
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,760
<14-7,Howard>我觉得很奇怪
<14-7,Howard>I think it's weird.

402
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,390
<14-8,Bernadette>华仔
<14-8,Bernadette>Howie?

403
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,400
<14-8,Bernadette>本来就是  他是个成年男人
<14-8,Bernadette>It is. He's a grown man.

404
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,510
<14-9,Howard>他就这样不交房租住下去吗
<14-9,Howard>He's just gonna live there rent-free?

405
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,880
<14-9,Howard>这样如何让他有动力
<14-9,Howard>How is that gonna motivate him

406
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
<14-9,Howard>不再懒惰  去找工作
<14-9,Howard>to get off his butt and get a job?

407
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,510
<14-9,Howard>你有人生计划吗
<14-9,Howard>I mean, do you even have a plan?

408
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,940
<14-10,Stuart>你又不是我爹  你管我
<14-10,Stuart>Hey, you're not my father, okay?

409
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,090
<14-10,Stuart>而且  你妈和我谈过了
<14-10,Stuart>And besides, your mother and I were talking...

410
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,730
<14-11,Howard>"你妈和我"  你又不是我爹
<14-11,Howard>"Your mother and I"? You're not my father!

411
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,440
<14-13,Howard>-我没说我是你爹  -我也没说
<14-13,Howard>- I didn't say I was your father! - Well, I didn't say

412
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,290
<14-14,Bernadette>-我是你爹  -好啦  冷静
<14-14,Bernadette>- I was your father! - Okay, calm down.

413
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,030
<14-14,Bernadette>你不是他爹  他不是你爹
<14-14,Bernadette>You're not his father, he's not your father!

414
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,750
<14-14,Bernadette>谁也不是谁的爹
<14-14,Bernadette>Nobody's anybody's father.

415
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,090
<14-15,Stuart>你看不惯我的人生选择我很遗憾
<14-15,Stuart>I-I'm sorry you don't like my life choices,

416
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,070
<14-15,Stuart>但这是我的人生
<14-15,Stuart>but it's my life!

417
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,500
<14-16,Howard>住我的房  就得守我的规矩
<14-16,Howard>Well, it's my house, it's my rules!

418
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,810
<14-17,Stuart>好吧  爹
<14-17,Stuart>Okay, Dad!

419
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,100
<14-17,Stuart>如果我修剪了草坪  可以给我零花钱吗
<14-17,Stuart>If I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?

420
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,300
<14-18,Bernadette>不准用这种挖苦的语气和他说话
<14-18,Bernadette>Hey, don't you take that sarcastic tone with him!

421
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,550
<14-19,Stuart>我不用听你教训我
<14-19,Stuart>I don't have to listen to you!

422
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,770
<14-20,Howard>别这样跟她说话
<14-20,Howard>Don't talk to her like that!

423
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,450
<14-20,Howard>这是我老妈  老婆
<14-20,Howard>That is my mother... Wife!

424
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,670
<14-20,Howard>老婆  我说的是老婆
<14-20,Howard>My wife! I said my wife!

425
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:19,900
<14-21,Stuart>算了
<14-21,Stuart>You know what?

426
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,560
<14-21,Stuart>这样谈不会有结果的
<14-21,Stuart>This isn't getting us anywhere.

427
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,610
<14-21,Stuart>你准备好道歉时  知道在哪里找我
<14-21,Stuart>When you're ready to apologize, you know where to find me.

428
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,430
<14-22,Howard>知道  我的家
<14-22,Howard>Well, yeah, in my house!

429
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,800
<14-23,Stuart>没错  小婊砸
<14-23,Stuart>That's right, sucka!

430
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,430
<15-1,Sheldon>要是我没去旅行就好了
<15-1,Sheldon>I wish I'd never gone on that trip.

431
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,000
<15-1,Sheldon>现在比起离开时  心情一点也没好转
<15-1,Sheldon>I feel no better now than when I left.

432
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,570
<15-2,Amy>但你还是有所成就的
<15-2,Amy>But you still accomplished something.

433
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,270
<15-3,Leonard>是的  如果你告诉任何人
<15-3,Leonard>Yeah. If you had told anyone

434
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,320
<15-3,Leonard>你打算坐火车周游全国
<15-3,Leonard>that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country,

435
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,040
<15-3,Leonard>你知道人家会怎么说吗
<15-3,Leonard>do you know what they would have said?

436
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,080
<15-4,Sheldon>-我做不到吗  -太对了
<15-4,Sheldon>- That I couldn't do it? - Exactly.

437
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,540
<15-5,Leonard>不过他们先会欢呼一下
<15-5,Leonard>Right after they said, "Yay!"

438
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,610
<15-6,Amy>但你做到了
<15-6,Amy>But you did do it.

439
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,680
<15-6,Amy>事情没有完全如你所愿又如何
<15-6,Amy>So what if it didn't all go your way?

440
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,950
<15-6,Amy>这样才是冒险啊
<15-6,Amy>That's what makes it an adventure.

441
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,050
<15-6,Amy>有道理
<15-6,Amy>That's a good point.

442
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,140
<15-7,Sheldon>我很像灰袍甘道夫
<15-7,Sheldon>Yeah, I'm a lot like Gandalf the Grey.

443
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,930
<15-7,Sheldon>他与炎魔战斗
<15-7,Sheldon>He fought the Balrog and emerged

444
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,570
<15-7,Sheldon>成为了更强大的白袍甘道夫
<15-7,Sheldon>stronger than ever as Gandalf the White.

445
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,190
<15-7,Sheldon>我的电话和裤子被抢了
<15-7,Sheldon>I was robbed of my phone and pants,

446
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,530
<15-7,Sheldon>我回来时变得更强大了
<15-7,Sheldon>and I, too, came back stronger.

447
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,710
<15-7,Sheldon>也更白了
<15-7,Sheldon>And whiter, too,

448
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,340
<15-7,Sheldon>因为我六周没有晒过太阳了
<15-7,Sheldon>'cause I wasn't in direct sunlight for six weeks.

449
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,470
<15-8,Amy>你瞧  这次旅行对你有好处
<15-8,Amy>See? This trip was good for you.

450
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,790
<15-9,Sheldon>的确
<15-9,Sheldon>Indeed.

451
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,250
<15-9,Sheldon>我是全世界最聪明的毛毛虫
<15-9,Sheldon>I was the world's smartest caterpillar.

452
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,790
<15-9,Sheldon>在咱们国家铁路网上化蛹后
<15-9,Sheldon>And then after pupating in our nation's railway system,

453
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,400
<15-9,Sheldon>我破茧而出
<15-9,Sheldon>I've burst forth

454
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,600
<15-9,Sheldon>变成了全世界最聪明的蝴蝶
<15-9,Sheldon>as the world's smartest butterfly.

455
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,360
<15-10,Leonard>蝴蝶可以自己从亚利桑那州飞回家
<15-10,Leonard>Butterfly could've gotten himself home from Arizona.

456
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,520
<15-11,Sheldon>我感觉重生了
<15-11,Sheldon>Yeah, I feel renewed.

457
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,020
<15-11,Sheldon>我准备好面对未来一切的改变
<15-11,Sheldon>I'm ready to deal with any changes that come my way.

458
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,310
<15-13,Penny>看谁回来了
<15-13,Penny>Look who's back!

459
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,010
<15-14,Sheldon>你的发型不同了  你换了发型
<15-14,Sheldon>Your hair is different. You changed your hair.

460
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,860
<15-14,Sheldon>我接受无能  我走人了
<15-14,Sheldon>I can't take this. I'm out.

461
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,460
<16-1,Sheldon>你们想看看我旅行时的照片吗
<16-1,Sheldon>Would you like to see pictures from my trip?

462
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,890
<16-2,Penny>你的电话不是被偷了吗
<16-2,Penny>I thought your phone got stolen.

463
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,810
<16-3,Sheldon>是的  但幸运的是所有照片
<16-3,Sheldon>Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos

464
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,700
<16-3,Sheldon>都在云端备份了
<16-3,Sheldon>got backed up to the Cloud.

465
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,540
<16-4,Leonard>原以为守得云开见月明
<16-4,Leonard>And you thought they all had a silver lining.

466
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,340
<16-5,Sheldon>看  第一天
<16-5,Sheldon>Here-- day one.

467
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,860
<16-5,Sheldon>这个是我本来要坐的座位
<16-5,Sheldon>Uh, this was the seat I was going to sit

468
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,780
<16-5,Sheldon>但我没坐
<16-5,Sheldon>in but didn't

469
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,500
<16-5,Sheldon>因为上面有饼干屑
<16-5,Sheldon>because there were cracker crumbs on it.

470
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,330
<16-5,Sheldon>因为是一等座  我怀疑是乐之饼干
<16-5,Sheldon>As it was first class, I suspect Ritz.

471
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,050
<16-5,Sheldon>这是火车上的厕所
<16-5,Sheldon>This is the train bathroom.

472
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,080
<16-5,Sheldon>这是我吃的泻立停
<16-5,Sheldon>This is the Imodium I took

473
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,180
<16-5,Sheldon>这样我不必使用火车上的厕所
<16-5,Sheldon>so I would never have to use the train bathroom.

474
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,700
<16-6,Penny>我真不敢相信你游遍了全国
<16-6,Penny>I cannot believe you traveled the entire country

475
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,390
<16-6,Penny>却从没离开过火车站
<16-6,Penny>and never left the train station.

476
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,410
<16-6,Penny>就是啊
<16-6,Penny>I know.

477
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,740
<16-7,Sheldon>我差点在得梅因的火灾中丧生
<16-7,Sheldon>You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines,

478
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,580
<16-7,Sheldon>但我坚持留在火车上
<16-7,Sheldon>but I stayed put.

479
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,310
<16-7,Sheldon>顺便说下
<16-7,Sheldon>FYI--

480
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,750
<16-7,Sheldon>当时泻立停的药效过了  我吓屎了
<16-7,Sheldon>that's when the Imodium gave out.
