00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,350
<2-3,Sheldon>我在《星球大战I：幽灵的威胁》播放完后
<2-3,Sheldon>Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace,

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,640
<2-3,Sheldon>留了吐槽这部的时间  但...
<2-3,Sheldon>for complaining, but...

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,500
<2-3,Sheldon>我怕一小时会不够
<2-3,Sheldon>I'm worried an hour won't be enough time.

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,920
<2-4,Leonard>谢尔顿  我有个坏消息
<2-4,Leonard>Sheldon, I-I've got some bad news.

35
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,970
<2-5,Sheldon>什么坏消息
<2-5,Sheldon>What is it?

36
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,180
<2-6,Leonard>我刚在网上看到
<2-6,Leonard>I just read online

37
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,150
<2-6,Leonard>亚瑟·杰弗里斯先生过世了
<2-6,Leonard>that Arthur Jeffries passed away.

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,160
<2-7,Sheldon>质子教授去世了吗
<2-7,Sheldon>Professor Proton is dead?

39
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,680
<2-8,Leonard>兄弟  节哀
<2-8,Leonard>Sorry, buddy.

40
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,180
<2-9,Sheldon>你在闹哪样
<2-9,Sheldon>What are you doing?

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,120
<2-10,Leonard>安慰你啊
<2-10,Leonard>Comforting you?

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,400
<2-11,Sheldon>你的心意可能对了
<2-11,Sheldon>Y-Your heart might be in the right place,

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,490
<2-11,Sheldon>但是你的头  胸  手臂  绝对放错地方了
<2-11,Sheldon>but your head, chest and arms certainly aren't.

44
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,640
<2-12,Leonard>总之  葬礼是在周日
<2-12,Leonard>Anyway, the-the funeral's on Sunday.

45
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,940
<2-13,Sheldon>可是那天是星球大战日啊
<2-13,Sheldon>But, that's Star Wars Day.

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,130
<2-14,Leonard>是啊  可是...
<2-14,Leonard>Yeah... um...

47
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,390
<2-14,Leonard>在所有该为这消息难过的原因中
<2-14,Leonard>of all the things about this that are sad,

48
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,100
<2-14,Leonard>撞日应该排不到第一吧
<2-14,Leonard>that might not be number one.

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,840
<2-14,Leonard>你还好吗  我知道他对你很重要
<2-14,Leonard>You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.

50
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,280
<2-15,Sheldon>我没事
<2-15,Sheldon>I'm fine.

51
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,100
<2-15,Sheldon>好吧
<2-15,Sheldon>Okay.

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,370
<2-16,Leonard>葡萄干麦片盒换封面的时候  他倒哭了
<2-16,Leonard>Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,490
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>小朋友们  跟你们说个有意思的
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls.

54
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,100
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>在猫头鹰进食完后  它们会以小球状
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal,

55
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,240
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>吐出它们消化不了的食物
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>that he can't digest, in the form of a pellet.

56
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,910
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>是不是很令人"呜呜"大笑
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>Is-Isn't that a hoot?

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,430
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>节目将在我炒了我的编剧后回来
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>We'll be right back after I fire my writers.

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,680
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>闭上你的鸟嘴
<3-1,Professor Proton (on youtube)>Oh, shut up.

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,540
<3-2,Amy>在看你的老朋友吗
<3-2,Amy>Watching your old friend?

60
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,330
<3-2,Amy>是啊
<3-2,Amy>Yes.

61
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,750
<3-3,Sheldon>艾米  你看他
<3-3,Sheldon>Look at him, Amy.

62
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,470
<3-3,Sheldon>太可惜了
<3-3,Sheldon>It's such a shame.

63
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,880
<3-3,Sheldon>在我的英年  他就这么去了
<3-3,Sheldon>Struck down in the prime of my life.

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,940
<3-4,Amy>你想我陪你一起去参加丧礼吗
<3-4,Amy>Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?

65
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,920
<3-5,Sheldon>我才不去那丧礼
<3-5,Sheldon>Oh, I'm not going to the funeral.

66
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,260
<3-6,Amy>为什么
<3-6,Amy>Why not?

67
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,020
<3-7,Sheldon>这么多人在擤鼻涕
<3-7,Sheldon>All those people blowing their noses.

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,110
<3-7,Sheldon>分不出哪个是在哭  哪个在生病
<3-7,Sheldon>You can't tell the sick from the sad. Mm.

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,560
<3-7,Sheldon>我会在家按照原定计划  庆祝星球大战日
<3-7,Sheldon>I'll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.

70
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,360
<3-8,Amy>你确定你不想去跟他道别吗
<3-8,Amy>Are you sure you don't want to go say good-bye?

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,880
<3-9,Sheldon>人生自古谁无死  省了吊唁不作死
<3-9,Sheldon>Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.

72
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
<3-10,Amy>那看一堆你看过几百次的
<3-10,Amy>And watching a bunch of goofy space movies

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,640
<3-10,Amy>宅爆太空电影就不作死吗
<3-10,Amy>you've seen hundreds of times isn't?

74
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,110
<3-11,Sheldon>如果我们是有肉体关系的情侣
<3-11,Sheldon>If we were in a physical relationship,

75
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,570
<3-11,Sheldon>你那句话就害你今晚没得爱爱了
<3-11,Sheldon>you just lost sex tonight.

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,650
<4-1,Penny>你们好啊

<4-5,Penny>不用了  谢谢  我要跟莱纳德去参加丧礼呢
<4-5,Penny>No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.

<4-6,Howard>确定吗  咖啡也不要吗
<4-6,Howard>You sure. Not even coffee?

<4-8,Penny>我懂了  就像是C-3PO
<4-8,Penny>Oh, I get it-- like C-3PO.

92
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,980
<4-8,Penny>我怎么会堕落至此
<4-8,Penny>What happened to me?

93
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,770
<4-9,Raj>谢尔顿  你想来点什么吗
<4-9,Raj>Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?

94
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,470
<4-10,Sheldon>不用了  谢谢
<4-10,Sheldon>Uh, no, thank you.

95
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,100
<4-11,Howard>你今天好安静
<4-11,Howard>You're being so quiet.

96
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,420
<4-11,Howard>你是心里难过  还是你个机械人在重启
<4-11,Howard>Are you upset or are you just rebooting?

97
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,600
<4-12,Sheldon>我没事
<4-12,Sheldon>I'm fine.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,700
<4-13,Penny>亲爱的  你确定你今天
<4-13,Penny>Sweetie, are you sure you don't want to

99
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,540
<4-13,Penny>不跟我们一起去丧礼吗
<4-13,Penny>come with us to the funeral?

100
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,790
<4-14,Sheldon>谢谢你的邀请  但亚瑟已经死了
<4-14,Sheldon>Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone

101
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,850
<4-14,Sheldon>我就算去了也做不到什么
<4-14,Sheldon>and there's nothing I can do about it.

102
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,240
<4-14,Sheldon>黑武士杀了欧比旺的时候
<4-14,Sheldon>When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan,

103
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,170
<4-14,Sheldon>卢克有哭天喊地  然后去参加丧礼吗
<4-14,Sheldon>did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?

104
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,840
<4-14,Sheldon>没有
<4-14,Sheldon>No.

105
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,880
<4-15,Penny>他把死星炸了
<4-15,Penny>He blew up the Death Star.

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,690
<4-15,Penny>我怎么会知道这个啊
<4-15,Penny>Why do I know this?!

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,050
<4-16,Sheldon>亚瑟·杰弗里斯是个科学家
<4-16,Sheldon>Arthur Jeffries was a scientist.

108
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,710
<4-16,Sheldon>我相信他不是个会在意
<4-16,Sheldon>I'm sure he didn't care about

109
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,110
<4-16,Sheldon>丧礼这种无聊事的人
<4-16,Sheldon>silly superstitions like funerals.

110
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,620
<4-16,Sheldon>如果他今天有来  他一定会说
<4-16,Sheldon>You know, if he were here, I think he'd say,

111
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,010
<4-16,Sheldon>"祝你们星球大战日玩得开心"
<4-16,Sheldon>"Enjoy Star Wars Day."

112
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,980
<4-17,Leonard>他都84岁了  他会说的是"我的布丁呢"
<4-17,Leonard>He was 84; he'd say, "where's my pudding?"

113
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,360
<4-18,Raj>你们走之前  让我帮你们打包点
<4-18,Raj>Before you go, at least let me pack you some

114
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,380
<4-18,Raj>司康的进攻  让你们路上吃吧
<4-18,Raj>Attack of the Scones for the road.

115
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,180
<4-19,Penny>《星战2: 克隆人的进攻》的双关嘛
<4-19,Penny>Oh, like Attack of the Clones.

116
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,120
<4-19,Penny>我们现在就走
<4-19,Penny>We are leaving right now.

117
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,950
<5-1,Amy>亚瑟去世的消息对谢尔顿的打击很大
<5-1,Amy>Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon

118
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,430
<5-1,Amy>但是他不愿意承认
<5-1,Amy>than he's ready to admit.

119
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,240
<5-1,Amy>真心希望这个能让他开心点
<5-1,Amy>Really hoping this will cheer him up.

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,650
<5-1,Amy>我也是
<5-1,Amy>Me, too.

121
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,160
<5-2,Bernadette>我们烤这个名字带"死"字的死星
<5-2,Bernadette>Although, it might've been thoughtless of us

122
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,640
<5-2,Bernadette>会不会有点不好
<5-2,Bernadette>to bake a Death Star cake.

123
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,260
<5-3,Amy>不会啊  这包含了两样他最爱的事物
<5-3,Amy>No, it combines two of Sheldon's favorite things:

124
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,300
<5-3,Amy>巧克力碎
<5-3,Amy>chocolate chips

125
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,240
<5-3,Amy>还有按个按钮就能摧毁个星球的能力
<5-3,Amy>and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.

126
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,060
<5-4,Bernadette>无论如何  这给男生们当惊喜也挺好
<5-4,Bernadette>Well, anyway, it'll be a nice surprise for the boys.

127
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,070
<5-4,Bernadette>华仔一直觉得我不把他的爱好当回事
<5-4,Bernadette>And Howie doesn't think I take his interests seriously,

128
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,970
<5-4,Bernadette>希望这个蛋糕能唬住他一阵子
<5-4,Bernadette>so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.

129
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,980
<5-5,Amy>拿上翻糖开始裱花吧
<5-5,Amy>Okay, let's get the fondant and start decorating.

130
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,380
<5-6,Bernadette>这挺酷的
<5-6,Bernadette>This is pretty cool.

131
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,910
<5-6,Bernadette>球体的蛋糕挺罕见呢
<5-6,Bernadette>You don't see too many spherical cakes.

132
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,480
<5-7,Amy>原因大概就是这个吧
<5-7,Amy>I wonder why that is.

133
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,480
<6-1,Penny>我想坦白一件事
<6-1,Penny>I have a confession to make.

134
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,940
<6-3,Penny>我从来没参加过丧礼
<6-3,Penny>I've never been to a funeral before.

135
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,850
<6-4,Leonard>真的吗
<6-4,Leonard>Really?

136
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,200
<6-5,Penny>我还没碰过认识的人过世
<6-5,Penny>I just never knew anyone that died.

137
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,280
<6-5,Penny>我小时候有一只宠物猪
<6-5,Penny>I had a pet pig when I was a kid.

138
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,490
<6-5,Penny>它死掉的时候没有办丧礼
<6-5,Penny>I mean, when he died, we didn't have a funeral,

139
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,980
<6-5,Penny>我们把它烤了
<6-5,Penny>we had a barbecue.

140
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,890
<6-6,Leonard>放心吧  今晚不会把亚瑟烤了吃的
<6-6,Leonard>Yeah, we won't be eating Arthur tonight.

141
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,120
<6-7,Penny>我虽然跟他不熟  但我挺喜欢他呢
<6-7,Penny>I didn't know him very well, but I still really liked him.

142
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,090
<6-7,Penny>他就这么去了  感觉好奇怪
<6-7,Penny>It's weird that he's... just gone.

143
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,300
<6-8,Leonard>我明白
<6-8,Leonard>I know.

144
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,990
<6-9,Penny>我感觉好想哭
<6-9,Penny>I feel like I want to cry.

145
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,310
<6-10,Leonard>没事的
<6-10,Leonard>Oh... that's-that's fine.

146
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,020
<6-10,Leonard>哭吧哭吧
<6-10,Leonard>Go ahead.

147
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,720
<6-11,Penny>-你盯着我  我哭不出来  -抱歉
<6-11,Penny>- I can't do it with you staring at me. - Sorry.

148
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,070
<6-13,Penny>不行  没眼泪
<6-13,Penny>No, I'm dry.

149
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,480
<6-13,Penny>你整天哭哭啼啼  你先开场  我再加入
<6-13,Penny>You're a big crybaby-- you start, I'll join in.

150
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,140
<6-14,Leonard>我才没整天哭哭啼啼
<6-14,Leonard>I am not a crybaby.

151
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,280
<6-15,Penny>看《玩具总动员3》时呢
<6-15,Penny>Toy Story 3?

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,710
<6-16,Leonard>玩具们在焚化炉里手牵手等死呢
<6-16,Leonard>The toys were holding hands in a furnace!

153
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,940
<6-16,Leonard>亚瑟这一辈子过得很充实
<6-16,Leonard>Look, A-Arthur lived a full life.

154
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,720
<6-16,Leonard>他鼓舞了很多人
<6-16,Leonard>And he inspired a lot of people.

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,870
<6-16,Leonard>的确  他是我儿时的偶像
<6-16,Leonard>Sure, he-he was my childhood hero,

156
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,450
<6-16,Leonard>但我后来有机会能与他
<6-16,Leonard>but... the fact that I got to work with him,

157
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,730
<6-16,Leonard>有共事的机会  在他...
<6-16,Leonard>side by side, before he...

158
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,120
<6-16,Leonard>去世之前...
<6-16,Leonard>died was...

159
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,120
<6-17,Penny>真的...  是老天的赏赐
<6-17,Penny>it was... it was a gift.

160
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,820
<6-17,Penny>的确是老天的赏赐
<6-17,Penny>It was a gift.

161
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,000
<6-17,Penny>谢谢你在我们的感情中
<6-17,Penny>Thank you for being the emotional one

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,010
<6-17,Penny>当多愁善感的那个
<6-17,Penny>in this relationship.

163
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,790
<6-18,Leonard>-一切有我  -是啊
<6-18,Leonard>- I got your back. - Yeah.

164
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,520
<7-1,Sheldon>好了  准备开始
<7-1,Sheldon>Okay, here we go.

165
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,260
<7-1,Sheldon>第一部  《幽灵的威胁》
<7-1,Sheldon>Episode I-- The Phantom Menace.

166
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,000
<7-2,Raj>赶紧看完了事吧
<7-2,Raj>Let's get this over with.

167
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,410
<7-3,Howard>既然我们大家都同意不喜欢第一部
<7-3,Howard>Since we all agree Episode I isn't our favorite,

168
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,890
<7-3,Howard>我们这次何不直接跳过呢
<7-3,Howard>maybe we just skip it this time.

169
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,310
<7-4,Sheldon>霍华德  我觉得所有人中
<7-4,Sheldon>Yeah, Howard, I think you of all people

170
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,940
<7-4,Sheldon>你最不应该有
<7-4,Sheldon>should avoid espousing the principle

171
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,440
<7-4,Sheldon>如果不喜欢某事物
<7-4,Sheldon>that if something is not our favorite

172
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,520
<7-4,Sheldon>就让它滚的心态
<7-4,Sheldon>we should just get rid of it.

173
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,740
<7-5,Raj>我听说过一种看星战电影的方法
<7-5,Raj>You know, I heard this way of watching the movies

174
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,250
<7-5,Raj>叫弯刀顺序  先看第五第六部
<7-5,Raj>called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V,

175
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,070
<7-5,Raj>然后跳过第一部
<7-5,Raj>then skip Episode I,

176
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,170
<7-5,Raj>把第二第三部当闪回看
<7-5,Raj>watch II and III as a flashback,

177
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,880
<7-5,Raj>然后看第四部做完结
<7-5,Raj>and then finish with VI.

178
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,960
<7-6,Howard>所以加加大多数的戏份
<7-6,Howard>Okay, so you'd lose most of Jar Jar,

180
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,860
<7-6,Howard>贸易路线与无聊的议会审讯戏全没了
<7-6,Howard>all the trade route talk, and the boring senate hearings,

181
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,030
<7-6,Howard>那无聊程度跟看公共事务台有得一拼
<7-6,Howard>which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.

182
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,470
<7-7,Sheldon>跳过贸易路线部分吗
<7-7,Sheldon>Get rid of the trade route part?

183
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,420
<7-7,Sheldon>那帕尔帕庭是怎么把
<7-7,Sheldon>Then how would Palpatine

184
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,870
<7-7,Sheldon>瓦洛伦议长搞下台  再夺位的
<7-7,Sheldon>get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office?

185
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,620
<7-7,Sheldon>少了那部分剧情  他会是怎么选上的
<7-7,Sheldon>How would he get himself elected? How?

186
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,070
<7-7,Sheldon>我们就不能过上一个
<7-7,Sheldon>Can we get through one holiday

187
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,190
<7-7,Sheldon>没有你胡言乱语的节日吗
<7-7,Sheldon>without you saying something ridiculous?

188
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,600
<7-8,Raj>只是个建议嘛
<7-8,Raj>It was just a suggestion.

189
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,790
<7-9,Sheldon>你知道还有什么事也只是个建议吗
<7-9,Sheldon>Well, you know what else was just a suggestion?

190
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,960
<7-9,Sheldon>"要不我们换一下早餐麦片盒的封面吧"
<7-9,Sheldon>"Why don't we change the Raisin Bran box?"

191
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,620
<7-9,Sheldon>你知道谁因此内心受伤了吗
<7-9,Sheldon>Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that?

192
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,290
<7-9,Sheldon>所有吃那个早餐的人啊
<7-9,Sheldon>Every single person who eats breakfast!

193
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,480
<7-11,Howard>我想质子教授的去世对他打击很大吧
<7-11,Howard>I think he's taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.

194
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,090
<7-12,Raj>我们该去开导他吗
<7-12,Raj>Should we try to console him?

195
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,480
<7-13,Howard>或者我们应该尊重他
<7-13,Howard>Or... should we respect his privacy

196
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,090
<7-13,Howard>内心哀伤时期的隐私
<7-13,Howard>in this moment of grief?

197
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,190
<7-14,Raj>就乖乖坐在这里看电影就行了
<7-14,Raj>By staying here and watching the movie.

198
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,980
<7-15,Howard>好朋友都会这么做啊
<7-15,Howard>That's what good friends would do!

199
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,280
<8-1,Howard>好歹因为谢尔顿不在这
<8-1,Howard>Well, at least without Sheldon here,

200
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,520
<8-1,Howard>我们可以从第四部开始看
<8-1,Howard>we got to start with Episode IV.

201
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,210
<8-2,Raj>是啊
<8-2,Raj>Mm, true.

202
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,890
<8-2,Raj>我心里对他挺过意不去的
<8-2,Raj>I do feel guilty about him.

203
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,770
<8-3,Howard>我也是
<8-3,Howard>Me, too.

204
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,210
<8-4,Raj>我们去看看他怎么样了吧
<8-4,Raj>Maybe we should see how he's doing.

205
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,770
<8-5,Howard>好啊
<8-5,Howard>Yeah.

206
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,260
<8-6,Raj>-等酒吧这一段看完再去吧  -必须的
<8-6,Raj>- But after the cantina scene. - Obviously.

208
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,430
<9-1,Sheldon>看看亚瑟
<9-1,Sheldon>Look at Arthur...

209
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,330
<9-1,Sheldon>被我的笑话逗得捧腹大笑
<9-1,Sheldon>cracking up at a joke I told him.

210
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,960
<9-1,Sheldon>我再也听不到他的笑声了
<9-1,Sheldon>I'll never hear that laugh again.

211
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,510
<9-2,Arthur>那次我也没笑
<9-2,Arthur>You never heard it that time.

212
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,150
<9-3,Sheldon>亚瑟
<9-3,Sheldon>Arthur!

213
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,630
<9-3,Sheldon>-我以为你死了  -是的
<9-3,Sheldon>- I thought you were dead. - I am.

214
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,620
<9-4,Arthur>感觉好极了
<9-4,Arthur>Oh, it-it's fantastic.

215
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,930
<9-4,Arthur>这是多年来我第一次
<9-4,Arthur>I mean, this is the longest that I've gone

216
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,860
<9-4,Arthur>这么长时间不需要总是跑厕所
<9-4,Arthur>without running into a men's room in-in years.

218
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,580
<9-5,Sheldon>你怎么会来我家
<9-5,Sheldon>Why are you here?

219
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,900
<9-6,Arthur>我也不知道
<9-6,Arthur>I-I don't know. I was...

220
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,340
<9-6,Arthur>我本希望去我前妻家吓唬她的
<9-6,Arthur>I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.

221
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,930
<9-7,Sheldon>我知道原因了
<9-7,Sheldon>I know why.

222
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,450
<9-7,Sheldon>你之所以来找我  是因为
<9-7,Sheldon>You've come to me because

223
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,310
<9-7,Sheldon>你是我的欧比旺[绝地武士]
<9-7,Sheldon>you're my Obi-Wan.

224
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,770
<9-8,Arthur>我不...我不懂你在说什么
<9-8,Arthur>I'm-I'm not... I'm not familiar with that.

225
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,860
<9-8,Arthur>那...是不是...
<9-8,Arthur>Is... is-is that an...

226
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,170
<9-8,Arthur>就是互联网啊
<9-8,Arthur>an Internet?

227
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,740
<9-8,Arthur>鸡同鸭讲
<9-8,Arthur>Wow.

228
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,430
<9-9,Sheldon>算了  我就不跟死人计较了
<9-9,Sheldon>Uh, you're dead, so I'm going to let that slide.

229
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,390
<9-9,Sheldon>欧比旺·肯诺比是《星球大战》中的一个角色
<9-9,Sheldon>Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars.

230
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,340
<9-9,Sheldon>他在身体消失后
<9-9,Sheldon>After his physical demise,

231
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,310
<9-9,Sheldon>以灵魂形体出现卢克·天行者面前  继续指导他
<9-9,Sheldon>he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.

232
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,250
<9-10,Arthur>你的解释让我"豁然开朗"
<9-10,Arthur>Well, that... that clears that up.

233
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,610
<9-11,Sheldon>你一定是来给我建议的
<9-11,Sheldon>You must be here to give me advice.

234
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,610
<9-12,Arthur>这...这装束好奇怪
<9-12,Arthur>Well, this... this is weird.

235
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,140
<9-12,Arthur>我大多数长袍开口都在后面
<9-12,Arthur>Most-most of my robes open in...

236
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,870
<9-12,Arthur>方便上厕所
<9-12,Arthur>in the back.

237
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,330
<9-13,Sheldon>这是绝地武士袍
<9-13,Sheldon>Those are your Jedi robes.

238
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,220
<9-14,Arthur>等等  这...
<9-14,Arthur>Oh, wait. What...?

239
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,370
<9-14,Arthur>这是什么
<9-14,Arthur>What-what... what is this?

240
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,140
<9-15,Sheldon>悠着点玩
<9-15,Sheldon>Oh! Be careful with that!

241
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,650
<9-16,Arthur>太酷了
<9-16,Arthur>Oh, neato.

242
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,290
<9-16,Arthur>我想...我需要一张创口贴
<9-16,Arthur>I'm, uh... I'm going to need a Band-Aid.

243
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,390
<10-1,Leonard>你参加了人生第一场葬礼  感觉如何
<10-1,Leonard>So...what did you think of your first funeral?

244
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,580
<10-2,Penny>虽然我不想失礼  但葬礼实在有点无聊
<10-2,Penny>Well, I don't want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.

245
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,420
<10-3,Leonard>等我死了  你可以租个蹦蹦城堡办葬礼
<10-3,Leonard>Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.

246
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,990
<10-4,Penny>你现在就想"死"这件事吗
<10-4,Penny>You think about dying?

247
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,840
<10-5,Leonard>我想得更多的是  怕自己会有遗憾
<10-5,Leonard>Well, I think more about if I'd have any regrets.

248
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
<10-6,Penny>你的遗憾会是什么
<10-6,Penny>What would you regret?

249
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,040
<10-7,Leonard>比如旅行太少
<10-7,Leonard>Mm, you know, that I didn't travel more,

250
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,940
<10-7,Leonard>冒险太少  只会一门语言
<10-7,Leonard>take more risks, learn another language.

251
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,890
<10-8,Penny>你还会克林贡语啊
<10-8,Penny>You know Klingon.

252
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,800
<10-9,Leonard>那倒也是
<10-9,Leonard>That's true.

253
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,070
<10-10,Penny>不  我是说这是你的遗憾之一
<10-10,Penny>No, I meant that as a regret.

254
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,040
<10-11,Leonard>-我刚又想到了一个  -是什么
<10-11,Leonard>- I just thought of one more. - What's that?

255
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,960
<10-13,Leonard>我遗憾在你求婚的时候  没有说"我愿意"
<10-13,Leonard>I regret not saying "Yes" when you asked me to marry you.

256
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,820
<10-14,Penny>那时候时机不对
<10-14,Penny>Well, it just wasn't the right time.

257
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,600
<10-15,Leonard>是啊
<10-15,Leonard>Yeah.

258
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,440
<10-16,Penny>现在也不是什么好时机
<10-16,Penny>And this is also not the right time.

259
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,600
<10-16,Penny>不准求婚
<10-16,Penny>Do not propose.

260
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,770
<10-17,Leonard>什么
<10-17,Leonard>What?

261
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,840
<10-18,Penny>我认得那表情  那是你要求婚的表情
<10-18,Penny>I know that face. That's your propose face.

262
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,600
<10-19,Leonard>我没打算求婚啊  现在都二比一了
<10-19,Leonard>I was not gonna propose. It's already two to one.

263
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,550
<10-20,Penny>什么二比一
<10-20,Penny>What's two to one?

264
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,330
<10-21,Leonard>我求过两次婚  你才求过一次  所以是二比一
<10-21,Leonard>I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.

265
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,740
<10-22,Penny>天啊   这又不是比赛
<10-22,Penny>Oh, my... It's not a contest.

266
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,240
<10-23,Leonard>我不懂你在气什么
<10-23,Leonard>I don't know what you're upset about.

267
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,190
<10-23,Leonard>-我才是比分落后的那个  -算了
<10-23,Leonard>- I'm the one who's losing. - Okay.

268
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,910
<10-24,Penny>那好  如果我现在跟你求婚
<10-24,Penny>Fine. Would you feel better if I propose

269
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,100
<10-24,Penny>给你机会拒绝我第二次  你会好过点吗
<10-24,Penny>so you could turn me down again?

270
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,530
<10-25,Leonard>当然会啊
<10-25,Leonard>Yeah, I think I would.

271
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,480
<10-26,Penny>好  莱纳德  你愿意娶我吗
<10-26,Penny>Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?

272
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,780
<10-28,Penny>你敢
<10-28,Penny>No, don't you dare.

273
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,880
<10-28,Penny>你快拒绝我  咱俩就扯平了
<10-28,Penny>You reject me right now and tie things up.

274
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,270
<10-29,Leonard>这可是一个很重大的决定
<10-29,Leonard>It's just such a big decision.

275
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,570
<10-29,Leonard>我不想留下任何遗憾
<10-29,Leonard>I don't want to have any regrets.

276
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,310
<11-1,Amy>你小时候看过质子教授吗
<11-1,Amy>Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?

277
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,000
<11-1,Amy>没有
<11-1,Amy>No.

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,290
<11-2,Bernadette>我爸爸掌控电视
<11-2,Bernadette>My dad controlled the TV,

279
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,010
<11-2,Bernadette>所以除非那人是《德州巡警》
<11-2,Bernadette>so unless someone was a Texas Ranger,

281
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,700
<11-2,Bernadette>或《帅虎猛龙》里的角色  否则没看过
<11-2,Bernadette>Jake or the Fatman, we didn't see it.

283
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,950
<11-3,Amy>我也从未看过  但是似乎是他
<11-3,Amy>I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason

284
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,140
<11-3,Amy>激发了谢尔顿对科学的兴趣
<11-3,Amy>that Sheldon got interested in science.

285
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,020
<11-4,Bernadette>我不是  我对科学感兴趣
<11-4,Bernadette>Not me. I got into science

286
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,670
<11-4,Bernadette>是因为我总是学校里最矮小的那个
<11-4,Bernadette>'cause I was always the smallest kid in school,

287
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,620
<11-4,Bernadette>所以我想如果我成为了科学家
<11-4,Bernadette>so I thought if I became a scientist,

288
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,600
<11-4,Bernadette>就可以发明出一种让我变高的药
<11-4,Bernadette>I could invent a formula that made me taller.

289
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,550
<11-5,Amy>这想法真天真
<11-5,Amy>That's cute.

290
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,380
<11-6,Bernadette>是啊  曾有一段时间我觉得真的有用
<11-6,Bernadette>Yeah, I thought it was working for a while,

291
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,650
<11-6,Bernadette>但结果却发现是我哥哥
<11-6,Bernadette>but then I found out my brother was just

292
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,890
<11-6,Bernadette>在量身高的门框上动手脚
<11-6,Bernadette>lowering the pencil marks on the door frame.

293
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,360
<11-6,Bernadette>你呢
<11-6,Bernadette>How about you?

294
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,410
<11-7,Amy>我想应该是在我当女子军那会
<11-7,Amy>Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.

295
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,300
<11-8,Bernadette>女子军
<11-8,Bernadette>Girl Sprouts?

296
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,910
<11-9,Amy>这是我妈妈为了跟女童军区分  故意取的
<11-9,Amy>My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts.

297
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,280
<11-9,Amy>她不想我"像妓女一般
<11-9,Amy>She didn't want me selling cookies

298
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,290
<11-9,Amy>在大街小巷叫卖饼干"
<11-9,Amy>on some street corner "Like a whore."

299
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,270
<11-10,Bernadette>那怎么会让你科学感兴趣呢
<11-10,Bernadette>How did that get you into science?

300
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,470
<11-11,Amy>我去图书馆
<11-11,Amy>Oh, I went to the library

301
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,830
<11-11,Amy>拿了一本生物学的书  看看妓女都做什么
<11-11,Amy>and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.

302
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,020
<12-1,Leonard>一方面  如果我说"我愿意"
<12-1,Leonard>On the one hand, if I say yes...

303
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,730
<12-2,Penny>一点都不好玩
<12-2,Penny>This isn't funny anymore.

304
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,330
<12-2,Penny>快拒绝我  然后我们就扯平了
<12-2,Penny>Just say no so we're done with this.

305
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,810
<12-2,Penny>你愿意还是不愿意娶我
<12-2,Penny>Will you marry me or not?

306
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,810
<12-3,Leonard>有意思  你刚是"又"向我求婚了吗
<12-3,Leonard>Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?

307
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,160
<12-4,Penny>-不是  -真的吗
<12-4,Penny>- No. - Really?

308
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,930
<12-5,Leonard>因为我刚明明听见  "你愿意娶我吗"
<12-5,Leonard>Because I just heard, "Will you marry me?"

309
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,140
<12-5,Leonard>一天求两次婚哦
<12-5,Leonard>That's two proposals, one day.

310
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,540
<12-5,Leonard>看来有人下半辈子都想教孩子
<12-5,Leonard>Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life

311
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,360
<12-5,Leonard>怎么拼"霍夫斯塔德"这个姓
<12-5,Leonard>telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.

312
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,740
<12-6,Penny>算了  随便你怎么样
<12-6,Penny>You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.

313
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,970
<12-7,Leonard>佩妮  不要生气嘛
<12-7,Leonard>Penny, don't get upset.

314
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,450
<12-7,Leonard>听着
<12-7,Leonard>Here.

315
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,820
<12-7,Leonard>我爱你  但我不会娶你
<12-7,Leonard>I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.

316
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,470
<12-8,Penny>谢谢
<12-8,Penny>Thank you.

317
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,770
<12-9,Leonard>那我们说回第二次求婚
<12-9,Leonard>Now, about that second proposal.

318
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,700
<12-9,Leonard>一方面...
<12-9,Leonard>On the one hand...

319
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,790
<13-1,Arthur>我们...我们这是在哪儿
<13-1,Arthur>Where... where... where are we?

320
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,770
<13-2,Sheldon>达戈巴的沼泽地
<13-2,Sheldon>This is the swampland of Dagobah.

321
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,750
<13-2,Sheldon>这是卢克接受绝地训练的地方
<13-2,Sheldon>It's where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.

322
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,370
<13-3,Arthur>太可惜了  我还以为是佛罗里达呢
<13-3,Arthur>Too bad. I thought it was Florida.

323
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,850
<13-4,Sheldon>当欧比旺在这里时
<13-4,Sheldon>When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot,

324
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,930
<13-4,Sheldon>他给了卢克各种有用的建议
<13-4,Sheldon>he gave him all sorts of helpful advice.

325
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,290
<13-4,Sheldon>所以
<13-4,Sheldon>So, um...

326
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,450
<13-4,Sheldon>你对我的建议是什么
<13-4,Sheldon>what do you got for me?

327
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,210
<13-5,Arthur>一定
<13-5,Arthur>Always...

328
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,480
<13-5,Arthur>要签...婚前协议
<13-5,Arthur>get... get a prenup.

329
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,890
<13-5,Arthur>就这样吗
<13-5,Arthur>That's it?

330
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,480
<13-6,Sheldon>我还以为你来找我有更深远的意义呢
<13-6,Sheldon>I thought there'd be more of a reason why you're here.

331
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,340
<13-7,Arthur>那你觉得我为什么来找你
<13-7,Arthur>Well, why-why do you think I'm here?

332
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,090
<13-8,Sheldon>我想可能跟你最近去世的事有关吧
<13-8,Sheldon>I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.

333
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,600
<13-9,Arthur>这是...  你第一次
<13-9,Arthur>Is-is this the... the first time

334
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,370
<13-9,Arthur>失去了跟你亲近的人吗
<13-9,Arthur>you've lost, you know, someone close to you?

335
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,540
<13-10,Sheldon>不  不是
<13-10,Sheldon>Oh, no. No.

336
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,530
<13-10,Sheldon>我已经经历过跟11代的神秘博士道别了
<13-10,Sheldon>I've already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.

338
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,850
<13-11,Arthur>我也比我好几任医生[博士]活得长
<13-11,Arthur>Yeah, I've-I've outlived a few of my doctors, too.

339
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,110
<13-12,Sheldon>当然  我的爷爷在我5岁的时候去世了
<13-12,Sheldon>Of course, my grandfather died when I was five.

340
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,160
<13-12,Sheldon>我父亲在我14岁的时候去世
<13-12,Sheldon>My father died when I was 14.

341
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,960
<13-13,Arthur>节哀顺变
<13-13,Arthur>I'm... I'm sorry about that.

342
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,790
<13-14,Sheldon>现在你也过世了
<13-14,Sheldon>And now you're gone, too.

343
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,800
<13-14,Sheldon>感觉所有我崇拜的男性都去世了
<13-14,Sheldon>It's like all the men I've looked up to have gone away.

344
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,940
<13-15,Arthur>你知道  其实...
<13-15,Arthur>Well, you know, it's...

345
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,490
<13-15,Arthur>是可以对他们的去世感到难过的
<13-15,Arthur>it's okay to... to be sad about them.

346
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,910
<13-15,Arthur>只是你要记住  你也得
<13-15,Arthur>Just... just make sure, you know, you appreciate

347
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,800
<13-15,Arthur>珍惜那些还在世的亲朋好友
<13-15,Arthur>those who... who are still there for you.

348
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,530
<13-16,Sheldon>我很珍惜他们啊
<13-16,Sheldon>But I do appreciate them.

349
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,530
<13-17,Arthur>既然如此
<13-17,Arthur>Well, then,

350
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,220
<13-17,Arthur>那我在这破沼泽
<13-17,Arthur>what am I doing in a swamp...

351
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,250
<13-17,Arthur>穿得像罗宾汉里的塔克修士干啥
<13-17,Arthur>...dressed like Friar Tuck?

352
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,260
<13-17,Arthur>珍惜眼前人  谢尔顿
<13-17,Arthur>Appreciate them, Sheldon.

353
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,760
<13-18,Leonard>兄弟
<13-18,Leonard>Hey, buddy.

354
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,770
<13-18,Leonard>听说你今天听不开心  你没事吧
<13-18,Leonard>Heard you're having a rough day. You all right?

355
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,600
<13-18,Leonard>我没事
<13-18,Leonard>I'm okay.

356
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,850
<13-19,Sheldon>丧礼如何
<13-19,Sheldon>How was the funeral?

357
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,500
<13-20,Leonard>挺好的
<13-20,Leonard>It was nice, you know.

358
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,320
<13-20,Leonard>很多人都来了
<13-20,Leonard>A lot of people showed up,

359
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,780
<13-20,Leonard>说了很多他生平的好事
<13-20,Leonard>told some great stories about him.

360
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,370
<13-20,Leonard>你知道亚瑟的儿子是个高中科学老...
<13-20,Leonard>Did you know that Arthur's son is a high school sci...?

361
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,110
<13-20,Leonard>他们要开始看第六部了
<13-20,Leonard>Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi.

362
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,540
<13-15,Arthur>你想去看吗
<13-15,Arthur>You want to go watch?

363
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,890
<13-16,Sheldon>想
<13-16,Sheldon>I do.

364
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,080
<13-21,Sheldon>但我得先让他们从第一部开始看
<13-21,Sheldon>After I make them go back and watch one through five first.

365
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,150
<13-22,Leonard>谢尔顿  那我们得花一整晚呢
<13-22,Leonard>Sheldon, that-that'll take us all night.

366
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,990
<13-22,Leonard>的确
<13-22,Leonard>That's true.

367
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,360
<13-23,Sheldon>幸好我小睡了一会
<13-23,Sheldon>Oh, it's a good thing I had a nap.

368
