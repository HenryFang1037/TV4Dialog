<1-1,Leonard>在13岁左右很酷  很受欢迎的人
<1-1,Leonard>that were cool and popular at 13

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,570
<1-1,Leonard>在之后的人生中  通常较难获得成功
<1-1,Leonard>have problems succeeding later in life?

<1-2,Raj>我现在就还行啊  我13岁时也很受欢迎
<1-2,Raj>I'm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,710
<1-4,Raj>不是  在家

<1-4,Raj>佣人们会给我唱歌
<1-4,Raj>The servants would sing to me,

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,070
<1-4,Raj>会捧场我的笑话
<1-4,Raj>laugh at my jokes...

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,180
<1-4,Raj>真希望我知道他们的名字
<1-4,Raj>I wish I knew their names.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,220
<1-5,Penny>研究有说不受欢迎的孩子之后会如何吗
<1-5,Penny>Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,870
<1-6,Leonard>你说呢  你每天起床时身旁就有一个
<1-6,Leonard>You tell me-- you woke up in bed with one.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,720
<1-7,Sheldon>你们听我说
<1-7,Sheldon>Listen to this.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,350
<1-7,Sheldon>我刚收到威尔·惠顿的电邮
<1-7,Sheldon>I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton.

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,450
<1-7,Sheldon>伦纳德·尼莫伊的儿子在拍一部纪录片
<1-7,Sheldon>Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary

<1-7,Sheldon>在他爸爸过世前就开始拍摄了
<1-7,Sheldon>that he started with his father before he passed away.

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,610
<1-7,Sheldon>主题是史波克先生及他对我们文化的影响
<1-7,Sheldon>It's about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.

17
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,130
<1-7,Sheldon>演员伦纳德·尼莫伊最著名的角色
<1-7,Sheldon>是《星际旅行》中的史波克

18
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,130
<1-8,Leonard>那他为啥要写信给你
<1-8,Leonard>Why is he writing to you?

19
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,170
<1-9,Sheldon>他们想找尼莫伊先生的粉丝做访问
<1-9,Sheldon>Well, they're looking for fans to interview,

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,670
<1-9,Sheldon>威尔觉得我挺适合
<1-9,Sheldon>and Wil thought I'd be good for it.

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,770
<1-10,Raj>击个掌
<1-10,Raj>Oh. Hey, high five.

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,630
<1-11,Sheldon>打死都不要
<1-11,Sheldon>Absolutely not.

23
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,000
<1-11,Sheldon>佩妮
<1-11,Sheldon>Yeah, Penny,

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,680
<1-11,Sheldon>你曾有过出镜的经验
<1-11,Sheldon>you spent some time in front of the camera.

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,220
<1-11,Sheldon>有何建议吗
<1-11,Sheldon>Any words of advice?

26
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,540
<1-12,Penny>有  别因为导演叫你脱
<1-12,Penny>Yes. Don't take your shirt off

27
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,800
<1-12,Penny>你就真的脱光
<1-12,Penny>just because the director said so.

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,510
<1-13,Sheldon>这是关于史巴克先生的纪录片
<1-13,Sheldon>This is a documentary about Mr. Spock.

29
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,020
<1-13,Sheldon>就算真有裸露镜头  也一定很有品味
<1-13,Sheldon>I'm sure if there's nudity, it will be tasteful.

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,060
<2-1,Bernadette>有空吗
<2-1,Bernadette>Hey. You got a minute?

41
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,430
<2-2,Howard>不太有
<2-2,Howard>Not really.

42
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,430
<2-2,Howard>我跟西哥特人正战得难分难解呢
<2-2,Howard>Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.

43
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,080
<2-3,Bernadette>暂停游戏  霍华德
<2-3,Bernadette>Pause the game, Howard.

44
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,450
<2-4,Howard>叫"霍华德"  惨了
<2-4,Howard>"Howard"? Uh-oh.

45
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,440
<2-4,Howard>先别碍事  西哥特人
<2-4,Howard>Make room, Visigoths.

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,810
<2-4,Howard>怎么了
<2-4,Howard>'Sup?

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,270
<2-5,Bernadette>我们得来谈谈重新装修这房子的事
<2-5,Bernadette>We need to talk about redecorating this place.

48
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,480
<2-6,Howard>不是吧  又来
<2-6,Howard>Oh, no, not this again.

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,000
<2-7,Bernadette>我理解你从小在这里长大
<2-7,Bernadette>Look, I get that you grew up here

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,980
<2-7,Bernadette>你对屋里的一切有着特殊的感情  可...
<2-7,Bernadette>and you're attached to things looking a certain way, but...

51
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,140
<2-7,Bernadette>我也想把这里当自己家
<2-7,Bernadette>I want this to feel like my house, too.

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,070
<2-8,Howard>亲爱的  这里当然是你自己家啦
<2-8,Howard>Oh, honey, of course it's your house.

53
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,280
<2-8,Howard>不然你整天打扫它干嘛
<2-8,Howard>Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?

54
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,020
<2-9,Bernadette>好吧  我换个方式说
<2-9,Bernadette>All right. Let's start over.

55
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,560
<2-9,Bernadette>老娘要装修
<2-9,Bernadette>I'm redecorating.

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,530
<2-9,Bernadette>家具  地毯  墙都要重弄
<2-9,Bernadette>The furniture, the carpeting, the walls.

57
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,580
<2-9,Bernadette>老娘要把看了会郁闷的东西全换掉
<2-9,Bernadette>I'm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it.

58
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,880
<2-9,Bernadette>试着别让自己也变其中一员
<2-9,Bernadette>Try not to be one of those things.

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,260
<2-10,Howard>我能说一件事吗
<2-10,Howard>May I say something?

60
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,130
<2-11,Bernadette>是想说我不能换掉墙纸
<2-11,Bernadette>Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper

61
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,770
<2-11,Bernadette>因为你爹打小就离开你  你娘还过世了吗
<2-11,Bernadette>'cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?

62
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,510
<2-12,Howard>没事儿了
<2-12,Howard>Never mind.

63
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,340
<2-12,Howard>艾米  是我谢尔顿
<2-12,Howard>Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon.

64
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,120
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我知道我们已经分手了
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Yeah, I-I know that we're broken up,

65
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,530
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>但我给你留言
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>but I'm leaving this message

66
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,590
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>是觉得你可能有兴趣看我
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>because I thought perhaps you'd like to watch me

67
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,590
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>在史波克先生的纪录片中接受访问
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock.

68
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,200
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>或者我更爱称之为是"史"记
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary.

69
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,160
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>我会在纪录片里讲这个哏
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>Yeah, I'm going to use that joke in the interview,

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,900
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>你看时尽量像第一次听到那样笑出来哦
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>so try to laugh like you're hearing it for the first time.

71
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,150
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>你懂吧  笑到抽筋
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>You know, hysterically, hmm?

72
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,210
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>但是又带有一点我已不在身边的悲伤
<3-1,Sheldon (on phone)>And with a tinge of sadness that I'm no longer in your life.

73
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,280
<3-2,Leonard>我才是想出"史"记这名字的人
<3-2,Leonard>I'm the one who thought of "Spockumentary""

74
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,440
<3-3,Penny>而我正像第一次听到那样笑着呢
<3-3,Penny>And I'm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,960
<3-4,Sheldon (answering door)>你们好
<3-4,Sheldon (answering door)>Hello.

76
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,870
<3-5,Wil Wheaton>你好  谢尔顿
<3-5,Wil Wheaton>Hey, Sheldon.

77
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,860
<3-5,Wil Wheaton>这位是亚当·尼莫伊
<3-5,Wil Wheaton>This is Adam Nimoy.

78
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,540
<3-6,Adam>-幸会  -我也很高兴见到你
<3-6,Adam>- Nice to meet you. - Oh, it's nice to meet you.

79
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,880
<3-7,Sheldon>我十分钦佩您父亲的作品
<3-7,Sheldon>I admire your father's work very much.

80
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,150
<3-7,Sheldon>而能见到从自己偶像的阴囊中
<3-7,Sheldon>It's not every day I get to meet someone whose life's journey

81
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,910
<3-7,Sheldon>开始人生旅途的人  也很稀奇
<3-7,Sheldon>began in my hero's scrotum.

82
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,550
<3-8,Wil>我就跟你说这家伙绝对极品
<3-8,Wil>I told you. This guy is gold.

83
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,880
<4-1,Bernadette>你在干嘛
<4-1,Bernadette>Whatcha doing? Oh!

84
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,040
<4-2,Howard>给自己做我爹离家后  我妈去世前
<4-2,Howard>Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me

85
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,140
<4-2,Howard>她会给我做的腊肠三明治
<4-2,Howard>after my dad left, but before she died.

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,350
<4-3,Bernadette>好啦  我在想
<4-3,Bernadette>Okay, listen, I'm thinking

87
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,360
<4-3,Bernadette>或许房子这件事我们可以有个折衷办法
<4-3,Bernadette>that maybe we can compromise on the house.

88
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,050
<4-4,Howard>我听着呢
<4-4,Howard>I'm listening.

89
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,220
<4-5,Bernadette>我们可以先装修一个房间  看看效果如何
<4-5,Bernadette>Let's just redo one room and see how it goes.

90
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,740
<4-6,Howard>此言有理
<4-6,Howard>That is reasonable.

91
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,630
<4-6,Howard>但装修哪间房间呢
<4-6,Howard>But what room?

92
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,890
<4-7,Bernadette>-比如这间  -绝对不行
<4-7,Bernadette>- How 'bout this one? - No way.

93
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,640
<4-8,Howard>不行  这是我跟我妈互动最多的房间
<4-8,Howard>No way, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.

94
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,410
<4-9,Bernadette>那浴室呢
<4-9,Bernadette>Then how about the bathroom?

95
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,030
<4-10,Howard>其实我们互动最多是在浴室
<4-10,Howard>I want to change my answer.

96
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,460
<4-11,Bernadette>好吧  那饭厅呢
<4-11,Bernadette>Fine. Then the dining room.

97
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,920
<4-12,Howard>我们的确是比较不常用那里
<4-12,Howard>I guess we didn't use it very often.

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,040
<4-12,Howard>只有有伴时才用
<4-12,Howard>Unless we had company.

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,550
<4-12,Howard>不过在我爹离家后  那就不怎么用了
<4-12,Howard>Which didn't happen much after my dad left and not at all

100
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,680
<4-13,Bernadette>-我妈去世后更是...  -很好  我去挑油漆样本
<4-13,Bernadette>- after my mom... - Great! I'm gonna go pick out paint samples.

101
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,040
<5-1,Adam>好的  我们就自然对话
<5-1,Adam>All right, we're just gonna have a conversation.

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,320
<5-1,Adam>假装没有镜头在拍你就行了
<5-1,Adam>Pretend the camera's not here.

103
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,380
<5-2,Sheldon>好  但这最好不是精心设计来
<5-2,Sheldon>All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme

104
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,220
<5-2,Sheldon>要骗人家宽衣解带的骗局
<5-2,Sheldon>to get me out of my shirt.

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,590
<5-3,Leonard>你跟亚当认识多久了
<5-3,Leonard>How long have you known Adam?

106
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,670
<5-4,Wil>几年了
<5-4,Wil>A few years.

107
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,850
<5-5,Leonard>他是哪里得罪你了
<5-5,Leonard>And what are you getting him back for?

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,170
<5-6,Adam>先从你的名字与职业说起吧
<5-6,Adam>Let's start with your name and occupation.

109
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,240
<5-7,Sheldon>谢尔顿·库伯博士  加州理工理论物理学家
<5-7,Sheldon>Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.

110
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,400
<5-8,Adam>你对史波克这角色最早的记忆是什么呢
<5-8,Adam>And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?

111
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,450
<5-9,Sheldon>《星际旅行:原初》系列中  我第一次看
<5-9,Sheldon>The first episode of StarTrek: The Original Series I ever saw

112
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,350
<5-9,Sheldon>是第1季第16集
<5-9,Sheldon>was "The Galileo Seven."

113
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,770
<5-9,Sheldon>史巴克在金牛座2号星上降落
<5-9,Sheldon>Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II.

114
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,230
<5-9,Sheldon>然后我哥走进来  坐在我头上
<5-9,Sheldon>Then my brother came in, sat on my head,

115
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,340
<5-9,Sheldon>然后说"吃屁吧"
<5-9,Sheldon>and said, "Eat farts."

116
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,730
<5-9,Sheldon>那次之后  我就着迷了
<5-9,Sheldon>After that day, I was hooked.

117
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,250
<5-9,Sheldon>对《星际旅行》着迷
<5-9,Sheldon>On Star Trek,

118
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,930
<5-9,Sheldon>不是对我哥的"菊花餐点"着迷
<5-9,Sheldon>not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine.

119
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,170
<5-10,Adam>史波克是哪一点吸引到了你呢
<5-10,Adam>What was it about Spock that appealed to you?

120
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,170
<5-11,Sheldon>我想所有被吸引的人  都是因为同个理由吧
<5-11,Sheldon>I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere,

121
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,030
<5-11,Sheldon>梦想着一个冷酷理智的世界
<5-11,Sheldon>the dream of a cold, rational world

122
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,570
<5-11,Sheldon>完全没有任何人类情感
<5-11,Sheldon>entirely without human emotion.

123
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,090
<5-11,Sheldon>史波克来自只讲逻辑的地方
<5-11,Sheldon>Spock came from a planet governed only by logic.

124
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,320
<5-11,Sheldon>在他家乡瓦肯星上  如果你的哥哥问你
<5-11,Sheldon>You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks,

125
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,690
<5-11,Sheldon>"你为什么要打自己"
<5-11,Sheldon>"Why are you hitting yourself?"

126
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,300
<5-11,Sheldon>那答案会是  "我没有啊
<5-11,Sheldon>The answer is, "I'm not.

127
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,560
<5-11,Sheldon>是你在控制我的手"
<5-11,Sheldon>You're moving my arm."

128
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,800
<5-11,Sheldon>然后他会回答"太有意思了"
<5-11,Sheldon>To which he says, "Fascinating."

129
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,020
<5-11,Sheldon>于是你们就一起看教育频道
<5-11,Sheldon>And then you both watch educational television.

130
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,450
<5-12,Penny>听到他说这类事情时
<5-12,Penny>Aw. When he says things like that,

131
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,010
<5-12,Penny>我就想过去抱抱他  哄哄他
<5-12,Penny>I just want to hug him and make everything better.

132
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,840
<5-13,Leonard>我哥对我也很坏啊
<5-13,Leonard>My brother was mean to me, too.

133
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,070
<5-14,Penny>你绝对是自己找揍
<5-14,Penny>Yeah, you probably had it coming.

134
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,290
<5-15,Adam>你有任何史波克的收藏品吗
<5-15,Adam>Do you have any Spock collectibles?

135
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,570
<5-16,Sheldon>我有很多啊
<5-16,Sheldon>I have many.

136
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,060
<5-16,Sheldon>但最珍贵的是尼莫伊先生亲笔签名的餐巾
<5-16,Sheldon>My most treasured is an autographed napkin

137
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,750
<5-16,Sheldon>来自我体贴的好友佩妮
<5-16,Sheldon>given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny.

138
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,310
<5-16,Sheldon>在第2季第11集时送的
<5-16,Sheldon>尼莫伊先生在2015年2月已去世

139
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,310
<5-16,Sheldon>她就在那边
<5-16,Sheldon>That's her over there.

140
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,000
<5-17,Penny>大家好
<5-17,Penny>Hi!

141
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,490
<5-17,Penny>瞧瞧
<5-17,Penny>Look at that.

142
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,540
<5-17,Penny>不用脱衣服就能出镜了呢
<5-17,Penny>I'm in a movie, my shirt stayed on.

143
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,930
<5-18,Adam>我们能看看那块餐巾吗
<5-18,Adam>Can we see the napkin?

144
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,510
<5-19,Sheldon>当然  失陪一下
<5-19,Sheldon>Of course. Excuse me.

145
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,370
<5-19,Sheldon>拿出来得费点功夫
<5-19,Sheldon>This will just take a moment.

146
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,300
<5-20,Leonard>墙式保险箱什么时候装的
<5-20,Leonard>When did we get a wall safe?

147
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,550
<5-21,Sheldon>在地板保险箱装满之后啊
<5-21,Sheldon>When there was no more room in the floor safe.

148
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,750
<5-22,Leonard>地板保险箱又什么时候装的
<5-22,Leonard>When did we get a floor safe?

149
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,130
<5-23,Sheldon>装了监控摄像机之后啊
<5-23,Sheldon>When we got the security camera.

150
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,490
<5-24,Leonard>还有监控摄像机吗
<5-24,Leonard>There's a security camera?

151
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,880
<5-25,Sheldon>潜水侠  自2012年以来一直保护你家
<5-25,Sheldon>Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.

152
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,150
<5-26,Penny>老天  我们在沙发上"做"过好些事情
<5-26,Penny>Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.

153
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,200
<5-27,Sheldon>是啊  你不说我也知道
<5-27,Sheldon>Yeah. You don't have to tell me.

154
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,260
<6-1,Raj>你的岳父现在在这呢
<6-1,Raj>So, your father-in-law is in there right now?

155
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,480
<6-2,Howard>是的  你要帮我说话
<6-2,Howard>Yes. So back me up.

156
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,770
<6-2,Howard>-就说这房子维持原样就好  -好的  哦了
<6-2,Howard>- The house is good the way it is. - Oh, okay. Got it.

157
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,770
<6-4,Howard>在忙什么呢
<6-4,Howard>Hey. What's going on?

158
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,180
<6-6,Bernadette>你好  拉杰
<6-6,Bernadette>Hey. Hey, Raj.

159
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,680
<6-6,Bernadette>我和爸爸在讨论把这面墙拆掉
<6-6,Bernadette>Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.

160
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,190
<6-7,Raj>你确定吗  这可是...一面好墙啊
<6-7,Raj>You sure? It's a... pretty great wall.

161
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,330
<6-8,Mr Rostenkowski>好在哪里
<6-8,Mr Rostenkowski>What's so great about it?

162
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,120
<6-9,Raj>很抱歉  我尽力了
<6-9,Raj>I'm sorry. I did what I could.

163
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,200
<6-10,Bernadette>不是吧  你把拉杰带过来帮你站队吗
<6-10,Bernadette>Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?

164
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,760
<6-11,Howard>你爸跟你是一队
<6-11,Howard>Your dad's on your side.

165
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,920
<6-12,Bernadette>他才没有站队  他是过来免费帮忙的
<6-12,Bernadette>He's not on my side. He's doing all the work for free.

166
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,730
<6-13,Raj>你真是太慷慨无私了
<6-13,Raj>That is so generous of you.

167
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,540
<6-13,Raj>我想换一队站
<6-13,Raj>I'd like to switch sides.

168
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,450
<6-14,Howard>听着
<6-14,Howard>Look, uh...

169
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,280
<6-14,Howard>我觉得你们不能把这面墙拆掉
<6-14,Howard>I don't even think you can take this wall down

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,500
<6-14,Howard>因为它是承重墙
<6-14,Howard>'cause it's load-bearing.

171
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,520
<6-15,Raj>想知道很容易
<6-15,Raj>Well, it's easy to find out.

172
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,420
<6-15,Raj>只要爬到房子和地基中间的夹层  一试便知
<6-15,Raj>Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.

173
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,140
<6-16,Howard>你的签证什么时候到期
<6-16,Howard>When is your visa up?

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,820
<7-1,Sheldon>这上面不仅有署名给我的签名
<7-1,Sheldon>Not only is it signed to me

175
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,120
<7-1,Sheldon>而且这里  还是他擦过嘴的地方
<7-1,Sheldon>but this is where he wiped his mouth.

176
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,430
<7-1,Sheldon>现在在大家面前的是伦纳德·尼莫伊的DNA
<7-1,Sheldon>So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.

177
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,170
<7-2,Wil>亚当不算是伦纳德·尼莫伊的DNA吗
<7-2,Wil>Um, doesn't Adam count as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?

178
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,060
<7-3,Sheldon>无意冒犯  但这可是100%纯尼莫伊
<7-3,Sheldon>No offense, but this is pure 100% Nimoy.

179
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,510
<7-3,Sheldon>而因为你妈  你只有50%的种
<7-3,Sheldon>Because of your mother, you're only 50%.

180
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,250
<7-3,Sheldon>这也不是坏事
<7-3,Sheldon>Which isn't bad,

181
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,060
<7-3,Sheldon>但你用来擦嘴的任何东西只会被扔掉
<7-3,Sheldon>but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.

182
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,370
<7-4,Penny>好了  不说餐巾了
<7-4,Penny>Okay, enough about the napkin.

183
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,620
<7-4,Penny>你里面都藏了什么宝贝
<7-4,Penny>What else you hiding in there?

184
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,640
<7-5,Sheldon>是不是超想知道啊
<7-5,Sheldon>Wouldn't you like to know?

185
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,460
<7-7,Sheldon>-是啊  -那行
<7-7,Sheldon>- I would. - All right then.

186
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,550
<7-7,Sheldon>就是一些我的重要物品
<7-7,Sheldon>See? Just my valuables.

187
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,360
<7-7,Sheldon>我的护照  我的威尔[遗嘱]
<7-7,Sheldon>My passport, uh, my Will...

188
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,160
<7-8,Leonard>-你还立好遗嘱啦  -是啊
<7-8,Leonard>- You have a will? - Yeah--

189
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,210
<7-9,Sheldon>1:18真人比例的威尔·惠顿手办
<7-9,Sheldon>my 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure.

190
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,040
<7-9,Sheldon>里面也有另一种遗嘱[威尔]
<7-9,Sheldon>I also have the other kind of will,

191
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,120
<7-9,Sheldon>里面写着把我的小威尔赠送给威尔
<7-9,Sheldon>and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.

192
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,070
<7-10,Leonard>威尔会想要吗
<7-10,Leonard>Will Wil want it?

193
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,600
<7-11,Wil>威尔不想要
<7-11,Wil>Wil won't.

194
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,960
<7-12,Penny>戒指盒里面的是什么
<7-12,Penny>What's that ring box?

195
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,290
<7-13,Sheldon>那是一枚订婚戒指
<7-13,Sheldon>Oh. That is an engagement ring

196
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,560
<7-13,Sheldon>我本来打算送给我女朋友艾米的
<7-13,Sheldon>that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.

197
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,870
<7-14,Penny>什么
<7-14,Penny>What?!

198
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,260
<7-15,Leonard>你给她买了戒指啊
<7-15,Leonard>You bought her a ring?

199
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,660
<7-16,Sheldon>不  这是我祖上一代代传下来的
<7-16,Sheldon>No, no, no. This has been in my family for generations.

200
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,780
<7-16,Sheldon>除了中间有一小段时间  印第安人
<7-16,Sheldon>Except for a short time when Comanches cut off

201
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,650
<7-16,Sheldon>把我曾曾曾祖母的手指切下来  把戒指偷走
<7-16,Sheldon>my great-great-great-grandmother's finger and stole it.

202
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,880
<7-17,Wil>-谢尔顿  这太惨了  -不
<7-17,Wil>- Sheldon, that's awful. - No.

203
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,310
<7-18,Sheldon>德州游骑兵追到他们的村子里
<7-18,Sheldon>The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village

204
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,640
<7-18,Sheldon>把整个村子给屠了  一个活口都没留
<7-18,Sheldon>and slaughtered every last one of them, so...

205
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,960
<7-18,Sheldon>所以这是个皆大欢喜的结局
<7-18,Sheldon>it was a happy ending.

206
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,970
<7-18,Sheldon>至少我的九指祖母欢喜了
<7-18,Sheldon>Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.

207
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,570
<7-19,Penny>说回戒指  艾米知道这事吗
<7-19,Penny>Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?

208
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,010
<7-20,Sheldon>不  我还没来得及提
<7-20,Sheldon>No. She broke up with me

209
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,760
<7-20,Sheldon>她就跟我分手了
<7-20,Sheldon>before I could broach the subject.

210
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,020
<7-21,Leonard>真遗憾  你一定觉得天都塌了吧
<7-21,Leonard>Oh, man, I'm sorry-- that must have been devastating for you.

211
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,400
<7-22,Sheldon>完全没有  我没事
<7-22,Sheldon>No, not at all. No, I'm fine.

212
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,970
<7-22,Sheldon>艾米对我们的感情持保留态度
<7-22,Sheldon>You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship,

213
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,520
<7-22,Sheldon>所以这就是最好的结果
<7-22,Sheldon>so all worked out for the best.

214
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,560
<7-23,Penny>-我知道  可...  -都说了我没事
<7-23,Penny>- I know. It just... - I said I'm fine!

215
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,650
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>我们有点跑题了
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>We've gotten a little off-topic.

216
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,740
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>就让我来说个笑话
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>Allow me to make things entertaining again

217
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,590
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>给这部"史"记增加点娱乐性
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>in this little Spockumentary.

218
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,540
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>那是莱纳德想的笑话
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>That was Leonard's joke.

219
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,720
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>小时候当我面临两难处境时
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>As a child, when faced with a dilemma,

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,320
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>我母亲会鼓励我问  "耶稣会怎么做"
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>my mother encouraged me to ask, "What would Jesus do?"

221
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,540
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>答案永远都是  "爱邻如爱己"
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>The answer to that was always, "Love thy neighbor."

222
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,540
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>但我的邻居有一颗烂牙  所以...
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>But my neighbor had a dead tooth, so...

223
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,060
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>我不可能爱他
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>that wasn't going to happen.

224
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,200
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>但...
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>But...

225
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,090
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>也因此我把问题改成  "史波克会怎么做"
<7-24,Sheldon (shouting)>that's why I changed it to, "What would Spock do?"

226
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,830
<7-25,Adam>你觉得对你有帮助吗
<7-25,Adam>Did you find that helpful?

227
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,590
<7-26,Sheldon>对啊  比如三年前
<7-26,Sheldon>Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago

228
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,380
<7-26,Sheldon>当我发现佩妮总吃掉我所有果塔饼干
<7-26,Sheldon>when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts,

229
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,200
<7-26,Sheldon>我没有生气或怀恨在心
<7-26,Sheldon>instead of getting angry or vindictive,

230
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,470
<7-26,Sheldon>反之我装了一个地板保险箱
<7-26,Sheldon>you know, I got a floor safe.

231
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,350
<7-27,Penny>我就知道我有闻到饼干味
<7-27,Penny>I knew I could smell 'em.

232
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,000
<7-28,Adam>不如从你小时候说起
<7-28,Adam>What about from when you were a kid?

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,650
<7-29,Sheldon>好的  在我八岁的时候
<7-29,Sheldon>Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old,

234
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,120
<7-29,Sheldon>比利·斯帕克斯在操场上把我逼到角落
<7-29,Sheldon>Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground.

235
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,340
<7-29,Sheldon>我就问我自己  "史波克会怎么做"
<7-29,Sheldon>I asked myself, "What would Spock do?"

236
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,760
<7-29,Sheldon>然后我抓住比利的肩膀
<7-29,Sheldon>Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder

237
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,090
<7-29,Sheldon>使出了我人生第一次瓦肯掐脖术
<7-29,Sheldon>and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.

238
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,090
<7-29,Sheldon>掐脖术是瓦肯人的一种身体对抗技巧
<7-29,Sheldon>由伦纳德·尼莫伊本人亲自发明

239
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,650
<7-30,Adam>管用吗
<7-30,Adam>Did it work?

240
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,910
<7-31,Sheldon>没用啊  他把我锁骨弄断了
<7-31,Sheldon>Oh, no-- he broke my collarbone.

241
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
<7-31,Sheldon>现在一动还会咯咯响
<7-31,Sheldon>I can still hear it click.

242
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,780
<7-32,Adam>那一定让你非常失望
<7-32,Adam>That must have been very upsetting for you.

243
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,880
<7-33,Sheldon>完全没有
<7-33,Sheldon>Oh, not at all.

244
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,380
<7-33,Sheldon>我前面就说了  效仿史波克的重点
<7-33,Sheldon>As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock

245
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,620
<7-33,Sheldon>就是克服人类情绪
<7-33,Sheldon>was to rise above human emotion,

246
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,920
<7-33,Sheldon>而我已花一生的时间来掌握它
<7-33,Sheldon>which I've spent a lifetime mastering.

247
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,470
<7-35,Sheldon>怎么回事
<7-35,Sheldon>Excuse me?

248
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,840
<7-36,Penny>抱歉  当我不在
<7-36,Penny>I'm sorry. I'm not here.

249
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,830
<7-37,Sheldon>不  你这样是啥意思
<7-37,Sheldon>No. You went . What does mean?

250
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,120
<7-39,Leonard>你的确那样了
<7-39,Leonard>You did go.

251
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,550
<7-40,Penny>好吧  谢尔顿  我虽然不是专家
<7-40,Penny>All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I'm no expert,

252
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,470
<7-40,Penny>但你好像完全没抓住史波克的重点
<7-40,Penny>but aren't you completely missing the point of Spock?

253
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,090
<7-40,Penny>他喜欢表现得好像自己没有情感
<7-40,Penny>I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions,

254
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,710
<7-40,Penny>但他仍是半个人类
<7-40,Penny>but he was still half human.

255
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,420
<7-41,Leonard>就像你
<7-41,Leonard>Just like you.

256
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,790
<7-42,Penny>我的意思是  你假装你没有
<7-42,Penny>I'm just saying, you pretend you don't,

257
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,840
<7-42,Penny>但你也是有情绪的人  就像其他人一样
<7-42,Penny>but you have feelings just like everybody else.

258
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,020
<7-43,Sheldon>不对  你看我
<7-43,Sheldon>Not true. No, look at me.

259
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,250
<7-43,Sheldon>我本来要向一位女孩求婚
<7-43,Sheldon>I had an engagement ring to give a girl,

260
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,960
<7-43,Sheldon>但在求婚之前  她就先跟我分手了
<7-43,Sheldon>and instead, she rejected me.

261
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,340
<7-43,Sheldon>我有对此情绪激动吗  没有
<7-43,Sheldon>And am I emotional about that? No.

262
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,080
<7-43,Sheldon>相反我坐在沙发上
<7-43,Sheldon>No, I am sitting here on a couch,

263
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,590
<7-43,Sheldon>若无其事般地谈论我最爱的电视角色
<7-43,Sheldon>talking about my favorite TV character like nothing happened.

264
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,050
<7-43,Sheldon>因为我跟他一模一样
<7-43,Sheldon>'Cause I am just like him:

265
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,640
<7-43,Sheldon>由始至终保持理智
<7-43,Sheldon>all logical, all the time.

266
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,620
<7-44,Penny>亲爱的  你已经开始嚷嚷了
<7-44,Penny>Sweetie, you're yelling.

267
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,360
<7-45,Sheldon>因为当我用正常音量讲话时
<7-45,Sheldon>Because when I speak at a regular volume,

268
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,320
<7-45,Sheldon>都没人相信
<7-45,Sheldon>no one seems to believe me

269
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,760
<7-45,Sheldon>我已经把艾米的这破事抛诸脑后了
<7-45,Sheldon>that I've put this Amy nonsense behind me!

270
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,790
<7-46,Wil>这部纪录片的精彩度绝对爆表
<7-46,Wil>This documentary is gonna be awesome.

271
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,210
<8-1,Mr Rostenkowski>-你在下面没事吧  -没事
<8-1,Mr Rostenkowski>- You gonna be okay down here? - Yeah. Yeah,

272
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,720
<8-2,Howard>我觉得自己好像考古学家
<8-2,Howard>I feel like an archaeologist.

273
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,760
<8-2,Howard>印第安纳·琼斯之单户家庭房历险
<8-2,Howard>Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling.

274
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,210
<8-2,Howard>看
<8-2,Howard>Hey. Look!

275
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,030
<8-2,Howard>我找到一个贝壳
<8-2,Howard>Found a seashell.

276
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,290
<8-3,Mr Rostenkowski>那是死老鼠的头盖骨
<8-3,Mr Rostenkowski>Yeah, that's a rat skull.

277
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,880
<8-5,Mr Rostenkowski>别紧张
<8-5,Mr Rostenkowski>Relax.

278
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,980
<8-5,Mr Rostenkowski>这里动物屎尿够多了  你别再给我们增加
<8-5,Mr Rostenkowski>There's enough droppings down here without you making more.

279
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,970
<8-6,Howard>抱歉  你知道我们现在大概到哪里了吗
<8-6,Howard>Sorry. Do you have a... sense of where we are?

280
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,820
<8-7,Mr Rostenkowski>知道  我想那里应该是小室吧
<8-7,Mr Rostenkowski>Yeah. I think that's the den.

281
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,210
<8-8,Howard>好  我们应该是在餐厅下面了
<8-8,Howard>Okay, so we must be under the dining room.

282
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,440
<8-9,Mr Rostenkowski>没错
<8-9,Mr Rostenkowski>Yep.

283
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,970
<8-9,Mr Rostenkowski>我知道你不想听到这个
<8-9,Mr Rostenkowski>You know, I know you don't want to hear this,

284
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,620
<8-9,Mr Rostenkowski>但如果把那个小室改造成婴儿室
<8-9,Mr Rostenkowski>but it wouldn't take that much work to turn that den

285
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,530
<8-9,Mr Rostenkowski>花不了什么功夫
<8-9,Mr Rostenkowski>into a nursery.

286
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,570
<8-10,Howard>我为什么不想听到这个呀
<8-10,Howard>Why wouldn't I want to hear it?

287
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,160
<8-11,Mr Rostenkowski>因为妮妮说你不想要孩子
<8-11,Mr Rostenkowski>'Cause Bernie said you didn't want kids.

288
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,980
<8-12,Howard>完全不是
<8-12,Howard>That's not true at all.

289
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,280
<8-12,Howard>我非常希望她怀孕  相信我
<8-12,Howard>I-I wish she'd get pregnant, believe me.

290
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,230
<8-12,Howard>我一有机会就往她身上爬
<8-12,Howard>I'm climbing on top of her every chance I get.

291
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,020
<8-12,Howard>当然是以一种充满爱与恭敬的方式
<8-12,Howard>In a... loving and respectful manner.

292
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,720
<8-12,Howard>重点是
<8-12,Howard>The point is,

293
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,640
<8-12,Howard>我真的很想要孩子
<8-12,Howard>I really do want kids.

294
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,450
<8-14,Howard>我不知道她为什么要骗你
<8-14,Howard>I don't know why she's lying to you.

295
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,160
<8-14,Howard>她才是不想要孩子的那个
<8-14,Howard>She's the one who doesn't want kids.

296
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,080
<8-14,Howard>事实上  每次我提到这事
<8-14,Howard>In fact, every time I bring up the subject...

297
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,310
<8-15,Bernadette (above)>地震来了
<8-15,Bernadette (above)>Earthquake!

298
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,580
<8-16,Howard>我的天  我们死定了
<8-16,Howard>Oh, my God, we're gonna die!

299
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,620
<8-17,Bernadette>余震来了
<8-17,Bernadette>Aftershock...!

300
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,760
<9-1,Penny>我不敢相信谢尔顿本来打算向艾米求婚
<9-1,Penny>I can't believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.

301
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,650
<9-1,Penny>我知道
<9-1,Penny>I know.

302
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,830
<9-2,Leonard>我更不敢相信他目睹了我们在沙发上"做"的事
<9-2,Leonard>I also can't believe he watched what we did on that couch

303
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,840
<9-2,Leonard>-还敢坐在上面  -是呀
<9-2,Leonard>- and still sits on it. - Yeah.

304
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,700
<9-4,Sheldon>你们好
<9-4,Sheldon>Hello.

305
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,990
<9-5,Leonard>老兄  你还好吗
<9-5,Leonard>Hey, buddy. How you doing?

306
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,060
<9-6,Sheldon>好多了
<9-6,Sheldon>Better.

307
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,310
<9-6,Sheldon>-威尔和亚当走了吗  -走了
<9-6,Sheldon>- Did Wil and Adam leave? - Yeah.

308
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,650
<9-8,Sheldon>你觉得他们会在片里留下我暴怒的片段吗
<9-8,Sheldon>Do you think they're going to put my outburst in the documentary?

309
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,230
<9-9,Leonard>-肯定了  -绝对的
<9-9,Leonard>- Definitely. - Oh, yeah.

310
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,470
<9-11,Sheldon>我也不需要纠结这事
<9-11,Sheldon>Well, there's no point in dwelling on it.

311
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,900
<9-11,Sheldon>借用一句瓦肯人的俗语
<9-11,Sheldon>As the Vulcans say,

312
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,120
<9-11,Sheldon>"人已杀  你无力还命"[瓦肯语]
<9-11,Sheldon>"Kup-fun-tor ha'kiv na'ish du stau."

313
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,830
<9-12,Penny>-你懂他的意思吗  -不懂
<9-12,Penny>- Do you know what that means? - No.

314
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,630
<9-14,Penny>你说的是实话吗
<9-14,Penny>Are you telling the truth?

315
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,270
<9-15,Leonard>非也[瓦肯语]
<9-15,Leonard>Nirsh.

316
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,020
<9-16,Sheldon>这一切都太荒唐了
<9-16,Sheldon>Well, this is ridiculous.

317
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,230
<9-16,Sheldon>总是为艾米的事伤心不能解决任何问题
<9-16,Sheldon>Being upset about Amy all the time isn't accomplishing anything.

318
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,800
<9-16,Sheldon>如果我想解决这件事
<9-16,Sheldon>If I want to resolve this situation,

319
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
<9-16,Sheldon>我就要行动起来
<9-16,Sheldon>then I need to take action.

320
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,210
<9-17,Penny>你要干什么
<9-17,Penny>What are you gonna do?

321
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,640
<9-18,Sheldon>我要去找她  向她求婚
<9-18,Sheldon>I'm going to find her and ask her to marry me.

322
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,760
<9-18,Sheldon>如果她答应了  我们就把这事彻底忘掉
<9-18,Sheldon>And if she says yes, we can put this behind us

323
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
<9-18,Sheldon>重新开始我们的关系
<9-18,Sheldon>and resume our relationship.

324
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,210
<9-18,Sheldon>如果她不肯答应
<9-18,Sheldon>And if she says no...

325
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,200
<9-18,Sheldon>那她就可以去自尽了[瓦肯语]
<9-18,Sheldon>well, then she can just ponfo miran.

326
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,650
<9-19,Leonard>他不是真心的
<9-19,Leonard>He didn't meant that.

327
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,240
<10-1,Bernadette>也许我该解释下我为什么撒了个小谎
<10-1,Bernadette>So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.

328
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,980
<10-2,Howard>那想必是极好的
<10-2,Howard>That would be nice.

329
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,790
<10-3,Bernadette>我告诉我爸你不想要孩子
<10-3,Bernadette>I told my dad that you were the one who didn't want kids

330
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,560
<10-3,Bernadette>是因为我不想让他失望
<10-3,Bernadette>because I didn't want to disappoint him.

331
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,650
<10-4,Howard>让我当替死鬼  你就忍心吗
<10-4,Howard>But you were okay throwing me under the bus?

332
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,260
<10-5,Bernadette>事实证明  我对此毫不犹豫
<10-5,Bernadette>Turns out yeah, I didn't think twice about it.

333
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,730
<10-6,Mr Rostenkowski>妮妮  你不用担心我
<10-6,Mr Rostenkowski>Bernie, you don't need to worry about me.

334
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,070
<10-6,Mr Rostenkowski>但是我不想看你错过这一切
<10-6,Mr Rostenkowski>But I don't want to see you miss out.

335
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,360
<10-6,Mr Rostenkowski>养育孩子是我人生中最获益匪浅的体验
<10-6,Mr Rostenkowski>Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.

336
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,470
<10-7,Bernadette>得了吧  啥都是我妈干的
<10-7,Bernadette>Oh, please. Mom did everything.

337
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,120
<10-7,Bernadette>你只不过是每天下班回家
<10-7,Bernadette>All you did was come home from work,

338
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,620
<10-7,Bernadette>坐在沙发上喝啤酒
<10-7,Bernadette>sit on the couch and drink beer.

339
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,390
<10-7,Bernadette>这算哪门子养育孩子
<10-7,Bernadette>How is that raising kids?

340
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,800
<10-8,Mr Rostenkowski>这话题看来只适合夫妻俩谈
<10-8,Mr Rostenkowski>This is really a conversation for husband and wife.

341
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,710
<10-8,Mr Rostenkowski>我这个外人还是洗洗回家吧
<10-8,Mr Rostenkowski>I'm gonna go clean up, hit the road.

342
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,930
<10-8,Mr Rostenkowski>如果你妈问起  我晚上10点才离开这里
<10-8,Mr Rostenkowski>If your mother asks, I was here till 10:00.

343
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,020
<10-9,Raj>真有趣  你爸爸不太做家务
<10-9,Raj>It's interesting your father didn't help around the house

344
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,830
<10-9,Raj>霍华德也不爱做家务
<10-9,Raj>and Howard doesn't help, either,

345
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,300
<10-9,Raj>所以从某种程度来说
<10-9,Raj>so... in a way,

346
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,960
<10-9,Raj>霍华德不光是像你爸爸
<10-9,Raj>Howard's not only like your father,

347
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,990
<10-9,Raj>他还像是你不敢生的孩子一样
<10-9,Raj>but he's also like the child that you're afraid to have.

348
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,750
<10-10,Howard>你怎么还不滚啊
<10-10,Howard>Why are you still here?

349
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,470
<10-11,Raj>好吧  我走了
<10-11,Raj>Fine, I'll leave.

350
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,320
<10-11,Raj>不过某人好像需要换尿布啦
<10-11,Raj>But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.

351
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,290
<10-11,Raj>好吧
<10-11,Raj>All right...

352
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,000
<10-12,Howard>我承认
<10-12,Howard>I admit...

353
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,940
<10-12,Howard>我的确不怎么帮忙干家务
<10-12,Howard>that I don't help out a lot.

354
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,420
<10-12,Howard>我需要改进这一点
<10-12,Howard>And I need to work on that.

355
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,440
<10-12,Howard>但是
<10-12,Howard>But...

356
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,400
<10-12,Howard>如果我们有了孩子
<10-12,Howard>if we had a kid,

357
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,000
<10-12,Howard>一切都会不一样
<10-12,Howard>it would be different.

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,450
<10-13,Bernadette>-为什么  -因为
<10-13,Bernadette>- Why? - Because...

359
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,870
<10-14,Howard>当我爸离开时
<10-14,Howard>when my dad left,

360
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,880
<10-14,Howard>我对自己保证说
<10-14,Howard>I promised myself that...

361
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,530
<10-14,Howard>如果我有机会做爸爸
<10-14,Howard>if I ever had a chance to be a father...

362
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,190
<10-14,Howard>我一定陪在孩子身边
<10-14,Howard>I'd always be there.

363
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,920
<10-15,Bernadette>好吧  我会考虑的
<10-15,Bernadette>Okay, I'll think about it.

364
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,750
<10-16,Howard>你这是认真考虑
<10-16,Howard>And this an actual "I'll think about it,"

365
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,720
<10-16,Howard>而不是像"我们能买辆带跨斗的摩托车吗"
<10-16,Howard>not like the "Can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar

366
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,420
<10-15,Bernadette>那样的"考虑一下"吧
<10-15,Bernadette>I'll think about it"?

367
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,860
<10-17,Bernadette>我是真的会认真考虑的
<10-17,Bernadette>It's an actual "I'll think about it."

368
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,240
<10-18,Howard>我相信我会成为一位好爸爸
<10-18,Howard>I really believe I'd be a great dad.

369
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,480
<10-19,Bernadette>我也相信你会
<10-19,Bernadette>I know you would.

370
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,580
<10-20,Howard>既然说到
<10-20,Howard>Speaking of...

371
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,760
<10-20,Howard>生宝宝  不如我马上洗漱一下
<10-20,Howard>making babies, what do you say I wash up

372
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,590
<10-20,Howard>然后戳戳你的小通道好不好啊
<10-20,Howard>and poke around your crawlspace?

373
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,480
<11-1,Kirk (on screen)>达娜医生觉得他没有那么危险
<11-1,Kirk (on screen)>Dr. Dana feels he isn't that dangerous.

374
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,790
<11-1,Kirk (on screen)>我凭什么相信你而不相信一位医生的话
<11-1,Kirk (on screen)>What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?

375
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,270
<11-2,Spock (on screen)>因为她有情感  而我没有
<11-2,Spock (on screen)>Because she feels. I don't.

376
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,540
<11-2,Spock (on screen)>我只按逻辑做事
<11-2,Spock (on screen)>All I know is logic.

377
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,900
<11-3,Sheldon>切  鬼才相信
<11-3,Sheldon>Yeah, right.

378
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,430
<11-3,Sheldon>你能就这样把情感大门关上
<11-3,Sheldon>You can just shut your feelings off.

379
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,990
<11-3,Sheldon>电视又一次欺骗了我们
<11-3,Sheldon>There goes television, lying to us again.

380
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,540
<11-3,Sheldon>我们让你养育我们的孩子
<11-3,Sheldon>We let you raise our children,

381
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,230
<11-3,Sheldon>结果你就这样报答我们
<11-3,Sheldon>and this is the thanks we get.

382
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,810
<11-3,Sheldon>莱纳德  我怎么能这么蠢
<11-3,Sheldon>Leonard, how could I have been so foolish

383
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,200
<11-3,Sheldon>试图去追随一个虚构的
<11-3,Sheldon>to try and follow in the footsteps

384
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,240
<11-3,Sheldon>没有情感的外星人种族的脚步
<11-3,Sheldon>of a made-up alien race with no emotions?

385
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,700
<11-4,Leonard>除了崇拜科幻人物  你还可以
<11-4,Leonard>Well...now instead of idolizing fictional characters,

386
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,720
<11-4,Leonard>把注意力放在身边的真实人物上啊
<11-4,Leonard>you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.

387
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,130
<11-5,Sheldon>好一句至理名言
<11-5,Sheldon>Those are very wise words.

388
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,420
<11-6,Leonard>谢谢
<11-6,Leonard>Thank you.

389
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,750
<11-7,Sheldon>如果来自电视里
<11-7,Sheldon>They'd just be so much more comforting

390
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,100
<11-7,Sheldon>听起来就更安慰人了
<11-7,Sheldon>if they came out of a television.
