1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,590
<1-1,Leonard>风筝嗬
<1-1,Leonard>Kites, ho!

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,650
<1-1,Leonard>风筝嗬
<1-1,Leonard>Kites, ho!

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,190
<1-4,All three>不好意思
<1-4,All three>Excuse me.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,950
<1-5,Sheldon>你们误用了"嗬"这个词
<1-5,Sheldon>You're misusing the word "ho."

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,320
<1-5,Sheldon>这是用于引起目标注意的感叹词
<1-5,Sheldon>It's an interjection used to call attention

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,480
<1-5,Sheldon>而不是物体  例如"停下嗬"
<1-5,Sheldon>to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, "Land, ho!"

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,390
<1-5,Sheldon>或者"向西嗬"
<1-5,Sheldon>Or, uh, "Westward, ho!"

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,220
<1-6,The three guys>风筝嗬
<1-6,The three guys>Kites, ho!

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,020
<1-7,Penny>各位好  在忙什么
<1-7,Penny>Hey, guys. Whatcha doin'?

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,050
<1-7,Penny>出去发现电的存在吗
<1-7,Penny>Going out to discover electricity?

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,350
<1-8,Leonard>如果你说的是本杰明·富兰克林的成果
<1-8,Leonard>If you're referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin,

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,290
<1-8,Leonard>他没有"发现电的存在"
<1-8,Leonard>he did not "discover electricity,"

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,520
<1-8,Leonard>他只是利用风筝证明
<1-8,Leonard>he merely used a kite to determine

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,220
<1-8,Leonard>闪电"带"电
<1-8,Leonard>that lightning "consists" of electricity.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,950
<1-8,Leonard>他还发明了富兰克林壁炉式取暖炉
<1-8,Leonard>He also invented the Franklin stove,

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,290
<1-8,Leonard>双光眼镜和灵活导尿管
<1-8,Leonard>bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter.

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,250
<1-8,Leonard>风筝嗬
<1-8,Leonard>Kites, ho.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,690
<1-9,Leonard>我们准备去斗风筝
<1-9,Leonard>We're heading out for some kite fighting.

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,420
<1-10,Penny>-斗风筝  -对
<1-10,Penny>- "Kite fighting"?  - Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,220
<1-11,Leonard>一项极具竞争性和激烈性的运动
<1-11,Leonard>It's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,650
<1-12,Sheldon>其实  割到喉咙的风险很低
<1-12,Sheldon>Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low.

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,430
<1-12,Sheldon>另外  严重被线擦伤才是真实
<1-12,Sheldon>On the other hand, severe string burn is a real

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,090
<1-12,Sheldon>且经常发生的危险
<1-12,Sheldon>and ever-present danger.

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,730
<1-13,Leonard>你想来观战吗
<1-13,Leonard>You want to come watch?

25
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,290
<1-14,Penny>天啊
<1-14,Penny>Oh, gee...

26
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,750
<1-14,Penny>听着很不错
<1-14,Penny>Sounds amazing.

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,620
<1-14,Penny>不过  我有些朋友会过来
<1-14,Penny>But, um, I've got some friends coming over.

28
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,150
<1-14,Penny>没什么大事
<1-14,Penny>Not a big thing-- we're just

29
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,700
<1-14,Penny>只是聚在一起看内布拉斯加比赛
<1-14,Penny>gonna watch the Nebraska game.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,250
<1-15,Leonard>橄榄球  行
<1-15,Leonard>Oh. Football, sure.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,290
<1-16,Howard>猜得好
<1-16,Howard>Good guess.

32
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,350
<1-17,Penny>我本想叫上你  但我知道你不是球迷
<1-17,Penny>I would've invited you, but I know you're not a football fan.

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,490
<1-18,Leonard>对  当然  很好
<1-18,Leonard>No, no, I'm not, so... great.

34
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,770
<1-18,Leonard>你能做自己喜欢的事
<1-18,Leonard>You've got plans

35
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,860
<1-18,Leonard>我也能做自己喜欢的事
<1-18,Leonard>doing something you like, I've got plans

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,660
<1-18,Leonard>这样很好
<1-18,Leonard>doing something I like, so it's good.

37
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,950
<1-19,Penny>我们能迟些再聚
<1-19,Penny>Well, maybe we'll hang out later--

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,270
<1-19,Penny>等大家都走了
<1-19,Penny>you know, after everybody's gone.

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,160
<1-20,Leonard>行  可以
<1-20,Leonard>Yeah, great.

40
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,050
<1-21,Penny>再见
<1-21,Penny>See ya.

41
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,280
<1-22,Leonard>太逊了
<1-22,Leonard>Well, this sucks.

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,550
<1-23,Sheldon>抱歉  我觉得无聊  开小差了
<1-23,Sheldon>I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off.

43
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,590
<1-23,Sheldon>什么东西很逊
<1-23,Sheldon>Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?

44
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,840
<1-24,Raj>莱纳德刚发现佩妮不想带他见朋友
<1-24,Raj>Leonard just realized that Penny's been hiding him

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,650
<1-24,Raj>因为莱纳德是个身材矮小
<1-24,Raj>from her friends because he's a tiny, little man

46
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,930
<1-24,Raj>又喜欢放风筝的人
<1-24,Raj>who flies kites.

47
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,700
<1-25,Sheldon>这当然会很逊
<1-25,Sheldon>Oh, that certainly would suck.

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,900
<1-25,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-25,Sheldon>第三季第六集

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,830
<2-1,Sheldon>沃罗威茨想侧翼包围咱们
<2-1,Sheldon>Wolowitz is trying to outflank us.

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,630
<2-1,Sheldon>你放线  飞高点
<2-1,Sheldon>Let out some string, add altitude

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,230
<2-1,Sheldon>我从下方偷袭割他的线
<2-1,Sheldon>and I'll go under and cut his line.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,970
<2-2,Leonard>为什么佩妮不想让她朋友认识我
<2-2,Leonard>Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,500
<2-3,Sheldon>集中精神比赛  莱纳德
<2-3,Sheldon>Focus, Leonard, focus!

54
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,900
<2-3,Sheldon>战斗的热浪迎面而来
<2-3,Sheldon>The heat of battle is upon us.

55
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,530
<2-3,Sheldon>战争的恶犬已被释放
<2-3,Sheldon>The dogs of war are unleashed.

56
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,930
<2-4,Leonard>或许库萨帕里说得对
<2-4,Leonard>Maybe Koothrappali's right.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600
<2-4,Leonard>也许我让她囧了
<2-4,Leonard>Maybe I embarrass her.

58
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,230
<2-5,Sheldon>你现在就让我囧了
<2-5,Sheldon>You're embarrassing me right now.

59
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,330
<2-5,Sheldon>一个大男人在放风筝的时候
<2-5,Sheldon>A grown man worrying about such nonsense

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,970
<2-5,Sheldon>居然担心这种无聊东西
<2-5,Sheldon>when in the middle of flying kites.

61
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,780
<2-6,Leonard>对不起
<2-6,Leonard>Sorry.

62
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,220
<2-7,Sheldon>道歉可打不下对方的风筝
<2-7,Sheldon>Sorry won't bring their kites down.

63
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,570
<2-7,Sheldon>被线擦伤  痛痛
<2-7,Sheldon>String burn! String burn!

64
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,000
<2-8,Raj>他们以为我们想侧翼包围
<2-8,Raj>Oh, they think we're flanking.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,210
<2-8,Raj>正中我们下怀
<2-8,Raj>They're playing right into our hands.

66
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,970
<2-8,Raj>我数到三  使出绝杀飞剪
<2-8,Raj>On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor.

67
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,610
<2-8,Raj>一  二
<2-8,Raj>One, two...

68
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,470
<2-9,Howard>哇
<2-9,Howard>Whoa!

69
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,460
<2-9,Howard>-看到没  -什么
<2-9,Howard>- Did you see that? - See what?

70
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,230
<2-11,Howard>那个小妞  她冲我笑
<2-11,Howard>That chick-- she smiled at me.

71
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,810
<2-13,Howard>-没有  -有
<2-13,Howard>- No, she didn't. - Yes, she did.

72
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,150
<2-14,Raj>快  飞剪  飞剪
<2-14,Raj>Come on, scissors, scissors!

73
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,780
<2-15,Howard>-帮我拿着  -等等
<2-15,Howard>- Hold my line. - Wait.

74
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,000
<2-16,Raj>你去干什么
<2-16,Raj>What are you doing?

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
<2-16,Raj>我没法单独使出飞剪
<2-16,Raj>I can't scissors by myself!

76
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,840
<2-16,Raj>霍华德  回来
<2-16,Raj>Howard! Come back!

77
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,920
<2-17,Sheldon>胜利
<2-17,Sheldon>Victory!

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,540
<2-18,Raj>狗娘养的
<2-18,Raj>Son of a bitch.

79
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,130
<3-1,Raj>你真是垃圾朋友  知道吗
<3-1,Raj>You're a sucky friend, you know that?

80
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,400
<3-1,Raj>比垃圾还垃圾的朋友
<3-1,Raj>A sucky, sucky friend.

81
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,000
<3-2,Howard>我能怎样
<3-2,Howard>What was supposed to do?

82
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,670
<3-2,Howard>她冲我那么诱惑一笑
<3-2,Howard>She gave me that "come-hither" look.

83
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,830
<3-3,Raj>就算她冲你笑  那也是笑你很逊
<3-3,Raj>If she gave you any look at all. it was a "you suck" look.

84
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,130
<3-4,Howard>如果没有拉伤大腿  我就能追上她
<3-4,Howard>I would've caught up to her if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

85
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,870
<3-5,Raj>拜托  你才80磅重
<3-5,Raj>Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds.

86
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,200
<3-5,Raj>哪有什么大腿肌肉
<3-5,Raj>You don't have a hammy.

87
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,100
<3-6,Leonard>佩妮不想带我见朋友
<3-6,Leonard>So, Penny doesn't want me around her friends.

88
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,870
<3-6,Leonard>我让她囧了  有其他可能吗
<3-6,Leonard>I embarrass her. What else could it be?

89
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,890
<3-7,Sheldon>她的行为
<3-7,Sheldon>Well, her actions

90
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,800
<3-7,Sheldon>能理解为顾及你的感受
<3-7,Sheldon>could be out of concern for your feelings

91
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,100
<3-7,Sheldon>也许她不让你参加聚会
<3-7,Sheldon>Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,060
<3-7,Sheldon>是因为她想物色新配偶
<3-7,Sheldon>because she's scouting for a new mate

93
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,810
<3-7,Sheldon>但不想让你看到
<3-7,Sheldon>and don't want to do it in front of you.

94
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,030
<3-8,Leonard>她真贴心
<3-8,Leonard>Oh... how kind of her.

95
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,470
<3-9,Sheldon>同意
<3-9,Sheldon>Agreed.

96
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,900
<3-9,Sheldon>大多数灵长类动物没有这种判断力
<3-9,Sheldon>Most primates don't show that sort of discretion.

97
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,500
<3-9,Sheldon>雌性倭黑猩猩会在前配偶面前
<3-9,Sheldon>A female bonobo will copulate with a new male

98
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,670
<3-9,Sheldon>与新配偶交配
<3-9,Sheldon>in front of the old one

99
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,570
<3-9,Sheldon>根本不会想"你怎么样"
<3-9,Sheldon>without so much as a "how do you do?"

100
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,910
<3-10,Raj>你老是这样  知道吗
<3-10,Raj>You always do this, you know?

101
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,900
<3-10,Raj>抛下我去追没有机会追到的女人
<3-10,Raj>You ditch me for a woman you don't have a shot with.

102
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,830
<3-11,Howard>我完全有机会
<3-11,Howard>I totally had a shot. With a woman

103
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,160
<3-12,Raj>在公园追逐一名女子
<3-12,Raj>you were chasing through a park--

104
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,930
<3-12,Raj>这不叫机会  这叫重罪
<3-12,Raj>that's not a shot, that's a felony.

105
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,980
<3-12,Raj>搭上我赢回来的帕唐风筝更罪加一等
<3-12,Raj>What's worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite.

106
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,710
<3-12,Raj>谢尔顿  能不能行行好
<3-12,Raj>Sheldon, I don't suppose there's any chance

107
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,020
<3-12,Raj>把风筝还给我
<3-12,Raj>you could give me my kite back?

108
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,370
<3-13,Sheldon>对不起  拉杰  空战的规则
<3-13,Sheldon>I'm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare

109
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,630
<3-13,Sheldon>规定战败的风筝归胜者
<3-13,Sheldon>dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor.

110
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,270
<3-13,Sheldon>没有规则  比赛就没有意义
<3-13,Sheldon>And without rules, the competition has no meaning.

111
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,600
<3-13,Sheldon>没有比赛意义
<3-13,Sheldon>And without meaning,

112
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,400
<3-13,Sheldon>下面的动作就只会是个空洞的姿态
<3-13,Sheldon>the following would be an empty gesture.

113
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,970
<3-13,Sheldon>你的风筝归我了
<3-13,Sheldon>I have your kite.

114
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,730
<4-3,Leonard>你的橄榄球派对如何
<4-3,Leonard>How was your football party?

115
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,700
<4-4,Penny>-很不错  我们赢了  -哇
<4-4,Penny>- It was pretty good. We won.  - Oh, wow.

116
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,170
<4-5,Leonard>太棒了
<4-5,Leonard>That's excellent.

117
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,970
<4-5,Leonard>你不觉得这个比喻很怪吗
<4-5,Leonard>It's a weird figure of speech, isn't it

118
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,900
<4-5,Leonard>不是我们在玩  却说"我们赢了"
<4-5,Leonard>"We won" when you weren't actually playing.

119
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,130
<4-5,Leonard>当我们看《星球大战》的时候
<4-5,Leonard>When we watch Star Wars,

120
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,770
<4-5,Leonard>我们不会说"我们打败了帝国"
<4-5,Leonard>we don't say, "We defeated the Empire."

121

<4-15,Leonard>Why would I be bored?

140
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,430
<4-16,Penny>因为他们不是天才科学家啊

167
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,470
<5-4,Raj>就可以从厕所中解脱出来
<5-4,Raj>you could get out of the bathroom

<5-7,Howard>你不会还在纠结风筝的事情吧
<5-7,Howard>You're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?

175
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,330
<5-8,Raj>这不仅仅是风筝的事情

<5-11,Howard>那不是小绵羊
<5-11,Howard>It's not a little scooter.

<6-1,Leonard>When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?

237
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,670
<6-2,Sheldon>待我囤积的吐司大军  足以毁灭传说中
<6-2,Sheldon>When I have enough to destroy all the human toast

238
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,240
<6-2,Sheldon>太空堡垒卡拉狄加上的人类吐司之后
<6-2,Sheldon>on the battlestar known as Galactica.

239
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,600
<6-2,Sheldon>你就穿这去佩妮那儿看橄榄球吗
<6-2,Sheldon>Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's?

240
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,600
<6-3,Leonard>这件球衣咋不对劲了
<6-3,Leonard>What's wrong with a football jersey?

241
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,430
<6-4,Sheldon>没啥
<6-4,Sheldon>Nothing.

242
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,470
<6-4,Sheldon>只是看上去更像特制橄榄球鸡尾酒
<6-4,Sheldon>That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.

243
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,740
<6-5,Leonard>这是最小号的
<6-5,Leonard>I's the smallest size they had,

244
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,770
<6-5,Leonard>除了狗狗衫以外
<6-5,Leonard>except the one for dogs.

245
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,740
<6-5,Leonard>难以置信  居然还有专门的狗狗衫
<6-5,Leonard>I can't believe they had one for dogs.

246
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,070
<6-6,Sheldon>当然有了
<6-6,Sheldon>Oh, yes.

247
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,770
<6-6,Sheldon>犬类球迷在德州司空见惯
<6-6,Sheldon>Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas.

248
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,970
<6-6,Sheldon>但是猫咪却不肯穿运动服
<6-6,Sheldon>Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel.

249
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,300
<6-6,Sheldon>我姐有过惨痛教训
<6-6,Sheldon>My sister found that out the hard way.

250
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,640
<6-7,Leonard>管他的  祝我好运吧
<6-7,Leonard>Anyway, wish me luck.

251
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,540
<6-8,Sheldon>等等  莱纳德
<6-8,Sheldon>Leonard, wait.

252
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,300
<6-8,Sheldon>你是想通过结交佩妮的朋友
<6-8,Sheldon>Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted

253
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,700
<6-8,Sheldon>来维持你俩间的性爱关系
<6-8,Sheldon>by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure

254
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,900
<6-8,Sheldon>我这么假设没错吧
<6-8,Sheldon>your continuing mating privileges with her?

255
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,500
<6-9,Leonard>对我来说不尽然如此
<6-9,Leonard>Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way

256
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,830
<6-10,Sheldon>那到底是怎样
<6-10,Sheldon>How would you put it?

257
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,430
<6-11,Leonard>好吧  其实就是你说的那样
<6-11,Leonard>Yeah, okay, like you said.

258
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,430
<6-12,Sheldon>看来要经历一段性关系
<6-12,Sheldon>Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble

259
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,660
<6-12,Sheldon>还真是麻烦得要命
<6-12,Sheldon>to go through for intercourse.

260
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,000
<6-12,Sheldon>你就不能花钱找个妓女吗
<6-12,Sheldon>Don't you have access to women who will do it for money?

261
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,510
<6-12,Sheldon>顺便
<6-12,Sheldon>By the way.

262
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,730
<6-12,Sheldon>在这种语境下也可以"嗬"一声
<6-12,Sheldon>Another accepted usage for the term "ho."

263
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,660
<6-13,Leonard>再见  谢尔顿
<6-13,Leonard>Good-bye, Sheldon.

264
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,830
<6-14,Sheldon>等下
<6-14,Sheldon>Hold on

265
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,330
<6-14,Sheldon>我认为按照社会传统规定
<6-14,Sheldon>I believe that social convention

266
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,360
<6-14,Sheldon>你可不能两手空空地上门
<6-14,Sheldon>dictate you not arriving empty-handed.

267
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,360
<6-14,Sheldon>带些赛昂吐司吧
<6-14,Sheldon>Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?

268
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,260
<6-15,Leonard>不带  我想融入其中  才不想被嘲笑
<6-15,Leonard>Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at.

269
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,900
<6-16,Sheldon>赛昂吐司有啥好笑
<6-16,Sheldon>What's funny about Cylon toast?

270
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,530
<7-1,Raj>门没锁
<7-1,Raj>It's open.

271
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,800
<7-2,Howard>好啊  哥们儿
<7-2,Howard>Hey, pal.

272
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,900
<7-3,Raj>你来干嘛
<7-3,Raj>What do you want?

273
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,700
<7-4,Howard>我给你带了件小礼物
<7-4,Howard>I brought you a little gift.

274
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,430
<7-4,Howard>一只新风筝
<7-4,Howard>New kite.

275
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,400
<7-5,Raj>你害我输掉的那只可是正宗的帕唐风筝
<7-5,Raj>The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang,

276
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,700
<7-5,Raj>是我兄弟从新德里给我寄来的
<7-5,Raj>Indian fighting kite

277
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,430
<7-5,Raj>印度战斗风筝
<7-5,Raj>that my brother sent to me from New Delhi.

278
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,430
<7-5,Raj>我组装了一整天  两天用来上色
<7-5,Raj>It took me a day to put together and two days to paint.

279
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,030
<7-5,Raj>而这是Hello Kitty
<7-5,Raj>This is Hello Kitty.

280
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,860
<7-6,Howard>没错  但这可附带一只零钱袋呢
<7-6,Howard>Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse.

281
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,830
<7-6,Howard>帕唐风筝有吗
<7-6,Howard>Does a Patang?

282
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,430
<7-7,Raj>你还是不懂  是吗
<7-7,Raj>Wow, you just don't get it, do you?

283
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,230
<7-7,Raj>就算你给我买什么可爱的小玩意
<7-7,Raj>Buying me something pretty isn't going

284
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,100
<7-7,Raj>也不能解决问题
<7-7,Raj>to make our problem just go away.

285
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,100
<7-8,Howard>听我说  我有时候的确
<7-8,Howard>Look, I admit I haven't always been

286
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,700
<7-8,Howard>不是一个绝佳好友
<7-8,Howard>the best friend I could be.

287
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,900
<7-9,Raj>你根本就是超级烂友  烂到极点
<7-9,Raj>You've been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.

288
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,300
<7-10,Howard>没说错
<7-10,Howard>Stipulated.

289
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,800
<7-11,Raj>你一直都这样
<7-11,Raj>And you do it all the time.

290
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,660
<7-11,Raj>上周在Radio Shack商场(美国电子产品零售商)
<7-11,Raj>Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking

291
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,730
<7-11,Raj>我们在帮你妈找一部超大号码键的电话
<7-11,Raj>for a phone with giant numbers for your mother,

292
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,100
<7-11,Raj>而我一转眼  你居然就不见了
<7-11,Raj>and I suddenly realize you're not even there.

293
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,730
<7-13,Raj>-我知道  -你去哪儿了
<7-13,Raj>- I know, I know... - And Where were you?

294
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,360
<7-14,Howard>被HDOS快餐店的一个女孩儿勾走了
<7-14,Howard>Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick.

295
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,600
<7-14,Howard>听我解释  她实在很火辣嘛
<7-14,Howard>But in my defense, she was gorgeous!

296
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,870
<7-14,Howard>一边用榨汁机做柠檬汁
<7-14,Howard>And working that squeezer to make the lemonade,

297
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,660
<7-14,Howard>一边上下扭腰摆臀的
<7-14,Howard>going and down and up and down.

298
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,200
<7-14,Howard>简直就是在美食天地中
<7-14,Howard>It was like a free pole dance

299
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,800
<7-14,Howard>免费欣赏钢管舞嘛
<7-14,Howard>right in the middle of the food court.

300
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,360
<7-15,Raj>你真是不可理喻
<7-15,Raj>You're impossible.

301
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,960
<7-16,Howard>至少我不用喝醉酒
<7-16,Howard>Hey, at least I can talk to women

302
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,460
<7-16,Howard>就能和女人交谈自如
<7-16,Howard>without being drunk.

303
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,660
<7-17,Raj>不好意思  我这是选择性缄默症
<7-17,Raj>Excuse me, I have selective mutism,

304
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,730
<7-17,Raj>被鉴定为是生理疾病
<7-17,Raj>a recognized medical disorder.

305
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,960
<7-17,Raj>你呢  你不过是个脑残
<7-17,Raj>You're just a douche.

306
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,360
<7-18,Howard>不  知道吗
<7-18,Howard>No. You know what?

307
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,230
<7-18,Howard>也许这才是原因
<7-18,Howard>Maybe that's what this whole thing's about.

308
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,330
<7-18,Howard>你不是在生我的气
<7-18,Howard>You're not mad at me,

309
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,600
<7-18,Howard>而是气你自己
<7-18,Howard>you're mad at yourself.

310
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,960
<7-19,Raj>不  我就是生你的气
<7-19,Raj>No, I'm mad at you.

311
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,400
<7-19,Raj>我是讨厌自己  但我还是生你的气
<7-19,Raj>I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.

312
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,930
<7-20,Howard>好吧  你生我气  我明白
<7-20,Howard>Fine. You're mad at me. I get it.

313
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,280
<7-20,Howard>何不今天咱一起过
<7-20,Howard>How about we go spend the day together?

314
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,060
<7-20,Howard>就我们俩
<7-20,Howard>Just the two of us.

315
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,510
<7-20,Howard>你想去哪儿都成
<7-20,Howard>We'll go anywhere you want.

316
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,260
<7-21,Raj>我不知道
<7-21,Raj>I don't know.

317
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,400
<7-21,Raj>别这样嘛
<7-21,Raj>Come on.

318
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,620
<7-22,Howard>我带你去好玩的地方
<7-22,Howard>Let me take you someplace nice.

319
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,790
<7-23,Raj>我很喜欢沥青坑博物馆(展出动物化石的公园)
<7-23,Raj>I-I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.

320
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,170
<7-24,Howard>现在去  那交通和停车问题
<7-24,Howard>Really, now? With the traffic and the parking?

321
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,380
<7-24,Howard>管他的  走
<7-24,Howard>Okay, fine.

322
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,250
<7-24,Howard>沥青坑  我们来啦
<7-24,Howard>The Tar Pits. Let's go.

323
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,790
<7-25,Raj>我怎么就对你没辙呢
<7-25,Raj>Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?

324
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,000
<8-1,Leonard>上啊上啊
<8-1,Leonard>Go! Go! Go!

325
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,760
<8-1,Leonard>快上  太好了
<8-1,Leonard>Go-go-go-go! Yes!

326
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
<8-1,Leonard>你们没看到吗
<8-1,Leonard>Are you people watching this?

327
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,030
<8-1,Leonard>这真是太棒了
<8-1,Leonard>Is this amazing or what?

328
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,760
<8-2,Penny>亲爱的  现在放的是
<8-2,Penny>Sweetie, that's a highlight

329
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,300
<8-2,Penny>98年冠军赛的比赛集锦
<8-2,Penny>from the '98 championship game.

330
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,630
<8-3,Leonard>我不知道
<8-3,Leonard>Oh. Did not know that.

331
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,630
<8-4,Penny>-你喝了多少  -没喝  怎么
<8-4,Penny>- How much beer have you had? - None, why?

332
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,100
<8-6,Penny>没啥  我只是希望你喝醉了
<8-6,Penny>Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk.

333
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,430
<8-6,Penny>-现在回到现场直播了  -好
<8-6,Penny>- Now we're back live. - Okay, yeah.

334
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,130
<8-7,Leonard>我能看出跟之前的差别
<8-7,Leonard>I can see the difference.

335
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,810
<8-8,Guy in baseball hat>怎么不掷黄旗  那绝对是故意出界
<8-8,Guy in baseball hat>Oh, where's the flag? That's intentional grounding.

336
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,870
<8-10,Leonard>-绝对的  -那完全就是个向前传球
<8-10,Leonard>- Totally. - That completely was a forward pass,

337
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,780
<8-10,Leonard>也就是说他们故意传球不成功
<8-10,Leonard>Which they threw intentionally incomplete

338
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,000
<8-10,Leonard>以免被罚码数  或为了节省时间
<8-10,Leonard>To avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time

339
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,990
<8-10,Leonard>我真不敢相信  裁判甚至不
<8-10,Leonard>I can't believe they're not

340
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,210
<8-10,Leonard>罚掉他们失去一次进攻机会
<8-10,Leonard>Being penalized with the loss of a down

341
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,030
<8-10,Leonard>并将启球线
<8-10,Leonard>And by having to move the line of scrimmage

342
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,800
<8-10,Leonard>移回到犯规的地方重新开始进攻
<8-10,Leonard>Back to the spot of the foul.

343
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,200
<8-11,Penny>来  吃块披萨  亲爱的
<8-11,Penny>Here, have some pizza, sweetie.

344
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,830
<8-12,Leonard>佩妮  你知道我有乳糖不耐症的
<8-12,Leonard>Penny, you know I'm lactose intolerant.

345
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,160
<8-13,Penny>我知道  我只想让你别说话
<8-13,Penny>I know. I just need you  stop talking.

346
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,360
<8-14,Sheldon>佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
<8-14,Sheldon>Penny. Penny. Penny.

347
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
<8-15,Penny>-谢尔顿  进来吧  -谢谢
<8-15,Penny>- Sheldon, come in. - Thank you.

348
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,500
<8-16,Sheldon>我想做三明治  但没面包了
<8-16,Sheldon>I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.

349
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,230
<8-17,Penny>冰箱里有
<8-17,Penny>There's some in the fridge.

350
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,060
<8-18,Sheldon>你不该把面包放冰箱里的
<8-18,Sheldon>You shouldn't keep your bread in the refrigerator.

351
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,560
<8-18,Sheldon>淀粉分子间的结晶作用  会让面包变硬
<8-18,Sheldon>Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules,

352
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,030
