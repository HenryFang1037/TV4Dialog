00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,580
<1-1,Penny>伯纳黛特  伴娘的礼服找得怎样了
<1-1,Penny>So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,880
<1-2,Bernadette>如果你不介意看上去像个
<1-2,Bernadette>Well, if you don't mind looking like

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,850
<1-2,Bernadette>橙色交通锥的话  已经找到了
<1-2,Bernadette>an orange traffic cone, great.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,960
<1-3,Amy>闺蜜们  我有办法解决礼服的问题
<1-3,Amy>Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,880
<1-4,Bernadette>真的吗
<1-4,Bernadette>Really?

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,130
<1-5,Amy>十二年前  我表妹艾琳全家
<1-5,Amy>12 years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,310
<1-5,Amy>在她结婚前晚  全死于一场可怕的
<1-5,Amy>died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,010
<1-5,Amy>一氧化碳中毒事故
<1-5,Amy>the night before her wedding.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
<1-6,Bernadette>人间惨剧啊
<1-6,Bernadette>That's horrible.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,360
<1-7,Amy>这倒未必
<1-7,Amy>Yes and no.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,530
<1-7,Amy>那些还没被穿过的伴娘衣服
<1-7,Amy>All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,690
<1-7,Amy>咱们就能免费享用了
<1-7,Amy>and available to us for free.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,630
<1-7,Amy>只能说  大难全死
<1-7,Amy>So it seems that cloud of odorless deadly gas

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,300
<1-7,Amy>必有后福啊
<1-7,Amy>had a silver lining after all.

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,790
<1-7,Amy>你们看
<1-7,Amy>Check it out,

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,920
<1-7,Amy>都还在袋子里呢
<1-7,Amy>still in the bags.

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,520
<1-7,Amy>不是说尸袋  是说礼服防尘袋
<1-7,Amy>The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

18
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,850
<1-8,Bernadette>这个嘛
<1-8,Bernadette>I don't know.

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,580
<1-8,Bernadette>穿死人剩的衣服不太好吧
<1-8,Bernadette>Dead people's dresses?

20
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,880
<1-9,Penny>是啊  而且那超短袖...
<1-9,Penny>Yeah, and cap sleeve...

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,030
<1-10,Amy>我还希望你们不会注意到呢
<1-10,Amy>Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,990
<1-10,Amy>艾琳总对打折的服饰毫无抵抗力
<1-10,Amy>Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes,

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,870
<1-10,Amy>超短袖太冷  开暖气才一氧化碳中毒的
<1-10,Amy>and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,090
<1-11,Sheldon>女士们  自制啊
<1-11,Sheldon>Ladies, please.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,640
<1-11,Sheldon>这间屋子曾是一个智慧的集合地
<1-11,Sheldon>These four walls once housed an intellectual salon

26
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,120
<1-11,Sheldon>在这里  大脑和胃袋都能吸收到营养
<1-11,Sheldon>where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach.

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,420
<1-11,Sheldon>虽然没人有错
<1-11,Sheldon>But through no one's fault,

28
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,790
<1-11,Sheldon>佩妮
<1-11,Sheldon>Penny,

29
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,400
<1-11,Sheldon>但晚餐谈话的质量的确下滑了
<1-11,Sheldon>the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined.

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,400
<1-11,Sheldon>再次重申  这事谁都不怪
<1-11,Sheldon>And again, I'm looking at no one in particular,

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,510
<1-11,Sheldon>佩妮
<1-11,Sheldon>Penny.

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,780
<1-12,Leonard>好吧
<1-12,Leonard>Fine.

33
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,830
<1-12,Leonard>那你想聊什么  谢尔顿
<1-12,Leonard>What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
<1-12,Leonard>你居然问谢尔顿想聊什么
<1-12,Leonard>What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?

35
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,810
<1-13,Howard>你何苦要逼死大家呢
<1-13,Howard>Why do you hate us?

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,980
<1-14,Sheldon>我准备了一些应该能同时吸引
<1-14,Sheldon>I've prepared a number of topics that should appeal to

37
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,710
<1-14,Sheldon>高阶谈天霸  与低档聊天人的话题
<1-14,Sheldon>both the advanced and novice conversationalists.

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,630
<1-15,Penny>你明显意有所指的瞄了我
<1-15,Penny>Okay, that time you looked at me.

39
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,710
<1-15,Penny>谁不想瞄你啊
<1-15,Penny>Who didn't?

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,210
<1-16,Amy>你的皮肤白璧无瑕
<1-16,Amy>Your skin is like alabaster.

41
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,120
<1-16,Amy>感觉根本没毛孔啊
<1-16,Amy>Do you even have pores?

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,440
<1-17,Sheldon>第一个话题
<1-17,Sheldon>Topic one:

43
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,760
<1-17,Sheldon>欧洲核子研究中心宣布超光速离子的存在
<1-17,Sheldon>"Faster-than-light particles at CERN--

44
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,540
<1-17,Sheldon>这是范式转换的新发现
<1-17,Sheldon>paradigm-shifting discovery

45
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,520
<1-17,Sheldon>还是像它们的乳酪一样千疮百孔的笑谈
<1-17,Sheldon>or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese?"

46
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,970
<1-17,Sheldon>开始高谈阔论吧
<1-17,Sheldon>And converse.

47
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,390
<1-18,Penny>好吧  谁想来
<1-18,Penny>All right, who wants to go

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,190
<1-18,Penny>我屋子里看看婚礼杂志
<1-18,Penny>to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,220
<1-19,Bernadette>我去看
<1-19,Bernadette>Oh, me.

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,100
<1-20,Penny>完全不怪任何人  谢尔顿  我们闪人了
<1-20,Penny>Through no one's fault, Sheldon, we're leaving.

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,630
<1-21,Amy>等等人家啦
<1-21,Amy>Wait for moi.

52
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,420
<1-22,Sheldon>你也要走吗
<1-22,Sheldon>You're leaving?

53
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,230
<1-23,Amy>谢尔顿  有时你忘记了我也是一名女士
<1-23,Amy>Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady.

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,030
<1-23,Amy>女人天生带一种雌激素  促使我们一边
<1-23,Amy>and with that, comes with an oestrogen fuel need to page through

55
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,100
<1-23,Amy>翻阅光鲜厚重的杂志  一边暗恨自己身材不佳
<1-23,Amy>thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.

<1-24,Sheldon>Delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?

58
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,190
<1-25,Raj>说得好
<1-25,Raj>Totally.

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,730
<1-25,Raj>超短袖有哪里不好了
<1-25,Raj>What's wrong with cap sleeves?

<2-1,Leonard>Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?

71
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,420
<2-2,Amy>你们神经科学部门借了我朊病毒培养箱
<2-2,Amy>Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions

72
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,390
<2-2,Amy>来协助我牛海绵状脑病的研究
<2-2,Amy>for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

<2-3,Sheldon>她是来讨一杯疯牛病
<2-3,Sheldon>She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,530
<2-4,Amy>把脑部退化疾病说得诙谐可不容易
<2-4,Amy>It's hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious,

75
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,680
<2-4,Amy>但你总能化正经为笑料
<2-4,Amy>and yet somehow you do it.

76
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,070
<2-5,Howard>餐桌上谈这个还"真"有意思啊
<2-5,Howard>That's fun to have in a lunchroom.

77
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,570
<2-6,Amy>真正的乐趣始于你能挑选
<2-6,Amy>The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,050
<2-6,Amy>任意小白鼠来注入病毒
<2-6,Amy>you're going to feed it to, and maybe you choose

79
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,290
<2-6,Amy>搞不好选中的就是那只老咬你的鼠妈妈
<2-6,Amy>the beady-eyed little mother who's been biting you all week.

80
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,980

<2-7,Howard>可不可以把那东西拿下桌
<2-7,Howard>Can we get that off the table

82
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,710
<2-7,Howard>然后换个话题聊啊
<2-7,Howard>and change the subject?

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,430
<2-8,Sheldon>换话题吗
<2-8,Sheldon>Can we?

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,590
<2-8,Sheldon>屏息以待吧
<2-8,Sheldon>Stand back...

85
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,380
<2-8,Sheldon>看哥怎么将聊天打屁升华到指点江山
<2-8,Sheldon>while I turn this conversation into a "Conver-sensation."

86

<2-9,Leonard>这次完全是你自找的
<2-9,Leonard>This time, it's your fault.

<3-9,Leonard>艾米很安全  不会被山猫吃掉的
<3-9,Leonard>I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.

129
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,780
<3-10,Sheldon>谁说艾米被山猫吃掉了
<3-10,Sheldon>Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?

<3-12,Sheldon>莱纳德  我不过是说说当地新闻
<3-12,Sheldon>Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item.

132
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,570
<3-12,Sheldon>都怪你  害我开始担心艾米被山猫吃掉了
<3-12,Sheldon>Now, thanks to you, I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.

133
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,360
<3-13,Leonard>就忘了山猫这档事吧
<3-13,Leonard>Forget about the bobcat.

134
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,860
<3-14,Sheldon>你猛提山猫  谁忘得掉啊
<3-14,Sheldon>How can I? You won't stop talking about it!

<4-1,Amy (singing)>*世间伤心事*
<4-1,Amy (singing)>*Everybody hurts*

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,170
<4-2,Sheldon (outside)>她哭哭啼啼的
<4-2,Sheldon (outside)>She sounds weepy.

141
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,870
<4-2,Sheldon (outside)>我讨厌人家哭哭啼啼  咱们走吧
<4-2,Sheldon (outside)>I don't like weepy. Let's go.

142
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,140
<4-3,Leonard>她可是你朋友

<4-7,Amy>谢尔顿  你来做什么
<4-7,Amy>Sheldon, what are you doing here?

149
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,440
<4-8,Sheldon>我和你的电子通信

150
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,500
<4-8,Sheldon>你全都没回应

151
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,880
<4-9,Amy>我想一个人待着
<4-9,Amy>I wanted to be alone.

152

<4-9,Amy>你想聊聊吗
<4-9,Amy>Would you like to talk about it?

<4-10,Sheldon>友情提醒  想回答"不想说"可别客气
<4-10,Sheldon>And keep in mind that "No" is a perfectly viable answer.

154
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,310
<4-11,Amy>谢尔顿  我的世界要崩溃了
<4-11,Amy>Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.

155
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,310
<4-12,Sheldon>按照程序
<4-12,Sheldon>Point of order.

156
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,790
<4-12,Sheldon>因为你不开心  按照惯例
<4-12,Sheldon>As you're in distress, it would be customary

157
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,100
<4-12,Sheldon>我该给你倒杯热饮
<4-12,Sheldon>for me to offer you a hot beverage.

158
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,750
<4-12,Sheldon>但我是你的客人
<4-12,Sheldon>But I'm a guest in your home,

159
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,600
<4-12,Sheldon>按照惯例  你该给我倒杯饮料
<4-12,Sheldon>so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage.

160
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,010
<4-12,Sheldon>你想要怎么来面对面互倒饮料呀
<4-12,Sheldon>How do you want to proceed vis-à-vis beverages?

161
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,390
<4-13,Amy>无所谓
<4-13,Amy>It doesn't matter.

162
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,170
<4-13,Amy>都无所谓了
<4-13,Amy>Nothing matters.

163
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,230
<4-14,Sheldon>如果你想聊别的  不谈这事
<4-14,Sheldon>If you'd like to take your mind off what's troubling you,

164
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,320
<4-14,Sheldon>坊间传言  有人目击这附近有山猫出没
<4-14,Sheldon>uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.

165
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,300
<4-15,Amy>佩妮和伯纳黛特没叫我
<4-15,Amy>Penny and Bernadette went shopping

166
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,560
<4-15,Amy>就自己去买伴娘礼服了
<4-15,Amy>for bridesmaids dresses without me.

167
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,790
<4-16,Sheldon>这让你...
<4-16,Sheldon>And that made you feel...

168
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
<4-16,Sheldon>不开心吗
<4-16,Sheldon>sad?

169
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,270
<4-17,Amy>是的
<4-17,Amy>Yes.

170
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,520
<4-18,Sheldon>我就知道
<4-18,Sheldon>I knew it.

171
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,130
<4-18,Sheldon>继续说
<4-18,Sheldon>Just keep going.

172
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,910
<4-18,Sheldon>我好像还挺会读心啊
<4-18,Sheldon>I guess I'm good at this.

173
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,150
<4-19,Amy>我以为她们是喜欢和我一起玩的
<4-19,Amy>It's just, I thought they liked hanging out with me,

174
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,620
<4-19,Amy>原来我只是自己骗自己
<4-19,Amy>but I guess I was fooling myself.

175
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,350
<4-20,Sheldon>是不是她们来你家的时候
<4-20,Sheldon>When they were over here,

176
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,040
<4-20,Sheldon>你没给人家倒饮料啊
<4-20,Sheldon>did you fail to offer them a beverage?

177
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,660
<4-20,Sheldon>某些人对这事很在意很不爽
<4-20,Sheldon>'Cause I can see how that could stick in someone's craw.

178
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,630
<4-21,Amy>谢尔顿  我想请你做件事
<4-21,Amy>Sheldon, I'm going to ask you something,

179
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,660
<4-21,Amy>希望你不要用异样眼光看待
<4-21,Amy>and I'd like you to keep an open mind.

180
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,100
<4-22,Sheldon>一贯如此
<4-22,Sheldon>Always.

181
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,850
<4-23,Amy>此时此刻  我很渴望
<4-23,Amy>At this moment, I find myself

182
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,290
<4-23,Amy>与人有亲密行为和肢体接触
<4-23,Amy>craving human intimacy and physical contact.

183
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,790
<4-23,Amy>亲娘咧
<4-23,Amy>Oh, boy.

184
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,730
<4-24,Sheldon>你知道我们的关系仅限于精神层面
<4-24,Sheldon>You know ours is a relationship of the mind.

185
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,630
<4-25,Amy>我提议
<4-25,Amy>Proposal.

186
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,670
<4-25,Amy>咱俩一夜激情  大战数千回合
<4-25,Amy>One wild night of torrid lovemaking

187
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,290
<4-25,Amy>既能抚慰我心  也令我胯下湿热
<4-25,Amy>that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.

188
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,070
<4-26,Sheldon>反提议
<4-26,Sheldon>Counterproposal.

189
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,880
<4-26,Sheldon>我会轻轻地梳你的头
<4-26,Sheldon>I will gently stroke your head

190
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,490
<4-26,Sheldon>然后反复地说  "谁是乖乖艾米宝贝啊"
<4-26,Sheldon>and repeat, "aw, who's a good Amy""

191
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,290
<4-27,Amy>那这样如何
<4-27,Amy>How about this?

192
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,530
<4-27,Amy>法式热吻  七分钟的巅峰体验
<4-27,Amy>French kissing-- seven minutes in heaven

193
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,170
<4-27,Amy>在你上我二垒后划下句点
<4-27,Amy>culminating in second base.

194
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,220
<4-28,Sheldon>我帮你揉脖子
<4-28,Sheldon>Neck massage...

195
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,670
<4-28,Sheldon>然后你给我倒杯饮料
<4-28,Sheldon>...then you get me that beverage.

196
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,890
<4-29,Amy>我们抱一下  不商量了
<4-29,Amy>We cuddle. Final offer.

197
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,950
<4-30,Sheldon>好吧
<4-30,Sheldon>Very well.

198
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,330
<4-30,Sheldon>真要命
<4-30,Sheldon>Oh, boy.

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,720
<4-31,Amy>我就说说  二垒你触手可得...
<4-31,Amy>I'm just saying, second base is right there.

200
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,020
<5-1,Raj>我在考虑给自己搞个另类造型
<5-1,Raj>Mm, I'm thinking about adopting some quirky affectation,

201
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,150
<5-1,Raj>比如弄个烟斗  单片眼镜
<5-1,Raj>like a pipe or a monocle

202
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,250
<5-1,Raj>或是翘八字胡
<5-1,Raj>or a handlebar mustache.

203
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,600
<5-2,Leonard>给外面那些满脑子想钓
<5-2,Leonard>For all those girls out there

204
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,390
<5-2,Leonard>印度钻石王老五一个明确的目标吗
<5-2,Leonard>looking for the Indian Monopoly man?

205
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,260
<5-3,Raj>这国家太危险了
<5-3,Raj>This is not a safe place.

206
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,990
<5-3,Raj>什么东西都不能露白
<5-3,Raj>You can't share anything here.

207
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,150
<5-4,Sheldon>你们两个  给哥管好你们的女人
<5-4,Sheldon>The two of you need to get your women in line!

208
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,220
<5-5,Howard>啥
<5-5,Howard>What?

209
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,340
<5-6,Sheldon>昨一整晚  我被强迫
<5-6,Sheldon>Last night I was strong-armed

210
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,650
<5-6,Sheldon>听那烦人的竖琴
<5-6,Sheldon>into an evening of harp music

211
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,150
<5-6,Sheldon>还得让情绪化的艾米·法拉·福勒熊抱
<5-6,Sheldon>and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler.

212
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,310
<5-6,Sheldon>本来那天晚上
<5-6,Sheldon>This on a night

213
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,350
<5-6,Sheldon>我是计划好要解决
<5-6,Sheldon>that I had originally designated for solving

214
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,590
<5-6,Sheldon>更高自旋引力场下的时空几何问题
<5-6,Sheldon>the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity

215
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,500
<5-6,Sheldon>以及搭乐高死星的呢
<5-6,Sheldon>and building my Lego Death Star.

216
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,850
<5-6,Sheldon>结果因为你们的马子  佩妮和伯纳黛特
<5-6,Sheldon>And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette,

217
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,800
<5-6,Sheldon>偷偷跑去买婚礼垃圾  也不叫上艾米
<5-6,Sheldon>went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy,

218
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,860
<5-6,Sheldon>她们完全没有想过
<5-6,Sheldon>an action they took with no thought or regard

219
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,570
<5-6,Sheldon>她们会影响到我  影响弦理论的未来
<5-6,Sheldon>as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory

220
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,540
<5-6,Sheldon>还影响我的乐高欢乐时光
<5-6,Sheldon>or my Lego fun time!

221
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,140
<5-7,Howard>那你想我们怎么办呢
<5-7,Howard>What do you want us to do about it?

222
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,360
<5-8,Sheldon>你显然没仔细听我的主题句
<5-8,Sheldon>You clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence:

223
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,480
<5-8,Sheldon>管好你们的女人
<5-8,Sheldon>Get your women in line!

224
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,930
<5-8,Sheldon>叫她们去跟艾米道歉  把关系修复好
<5-8,Sheldon>You make them apologize to Amy and set things right.

225
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,820
<5-8,Sheldon>我是个搞科研的人  不是某人的抱抱兔
<5-8,Sheldon>I am a man of science, not someone's snuggle bunny!

226
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,760
<5-9,Leonard>为什么要我去跟佩妮谈
<5-9,Leonard>Why do I have to talk to Penny?

227
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,070
<5-9,Leonard>她又不是我女朋友
<5-9,Leonard>She's not my girlfriend.

228
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,840
<5-10,Sheldon>四年前是你请她过来吃午饭的
<5-10,Sheldon>You invited her to lunch four years ago.

229
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,250
<5-10,Sheldon>她的事全怪你  你给我搞定她
<5-10,Sheldon>Everything about her is on you; you make it so!

230
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,610
<6-1,Leonard>-木须肉是佩妮的  -谢谢
<6-1,Leonard>- Moo-shu is Penny. - Thank you.

231
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,600
<6-2,Penny>谢尔顿呢
<6-2,Penny>Where's Sheldon?

232
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,870
<6-3,Leonard>他昨晚熬夜了
<6-3,Leonard>He was up late last night,

233
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,330
<6-3,Leonard>我提早喂他食  哄他睡觉了
<6-3,Leonard>so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.

234
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,890
<6-4,Bernadette>你真是体贴
<6-4,Bernadette>That's so sweet.

235
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,670
<6-5,Leonard>不过明天一大早  他就会起床闹着玩了
<6-5,Leonard>Yeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play.

236
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,640
<6-6,Howard>其实呢
<6-6,Howard>So, listen, guys,

237
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,170
<6-6,Howard>他昨晚之所以熬夜是因为
<6-6,Howard>the reason he was up late is because he was

238
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,580
<6-6,Howard>他要照顾艾米
<6-6,Howard>taking care of Amy.

239
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,240
<6-6,Howard>她有点伤心
<6-6,Howard>She's kind of upset.

240
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,070
<6-7,Penny>为什么
<6-7,Penny>Why?

241
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
<6-8,Leonard>她的感情有点受伤  因为你们
<6-8,Leonard>Her feelings got hurt because you guys

242
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,830
<6-8,Leonard>没叫她一起去逛街
<6-8,Leonard>went dress shopping without her.

243
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,520
<6-9,Bernadette>我跟你说了她会不高兴
<6-9,Bernadette>I told you that would happen.

244
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,820
<6-10,Penny>这是她第一次做伴娘
<6-10,Penny>Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid

245
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,910
<6-10,Penny>她有点兴奋过头了
<6-10,Penny>and she's just getting a little crazy with it.

246
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,820
<6-11,Bernadette>她老是不停地说不同文化里的伴娘习俗
<6-11,Bernadette>She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions

247
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,400
<6-11,Bernadette>而且都是得脱得光溜溜
<6-11,Bernadette>in other cultures, and they're all about

248
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,370
<6-11,Bernadette>互相给对方搓澡的那种
<6-11,Bernadette>getting naked and washing each other.

249
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,270
<6-12,Penny>对  她还老想知道
<6-12,Penny>Yeah, and she keeps trying

250
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,110
<6-12,Penny>我们的月经有没有同步
<6-12,Penny>to figure out if our cycles have synced up

251
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,690
<6-12,Penny>我们才能自诩为"三个同经手"
<6-12,Penny>so we can call ourselves "The three menstra-teers"

253
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,160
<6-13,Bernadette>我们以为不叫她
<6-13,Bernadette>We thought it would be easier

254
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,710
<6-13,Bernadette>一起去逛礼服会比较省事
<6-13,Bernadette>to look at dresses one time without her.

255
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,970
<6-13,Bernadette>我感觉好内疚
<6-13,Bernadette>I feel terrible.

256
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,720
<6-14,Penny>我也内疚  我们会找她谈
<6-14,Penny>I know. Me, too. We'll talk to her.

257
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,500
<6-14,Penny>等等
<6-14,Penny>Hey, wait,

258
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,160
<6-14,Penny>她怎么知道的
<6-14,Penny>how did she find out?

259
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,830
<6-15,Howard>拉杰告的密
<6-15,Howard>Raj did it.

260
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,970
<6-15,Howard>他说下次还会揭你们的短
<6-15,Howard>And he says he would do it again.

261
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,550
<6-15,Howard>好吧  对不起
<6-15,Howard>Hey, I'm sorry.

262
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,430
<6-15,Howard>你给我发照片  我当时没多想就说漏嘴了
<6-15,Howard>You sent me the picture; I wasn't thinking.

263
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,050
<6-16,Bernadette>-华仔  -别这样  平时
<6-16,Bernadette>- Oh, Howie. - Well, hey, I'm usually

264
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,570
<6-17,Howard>我的嘴巴还是挺严的
<6-17,Howard>pretty good at not blabbing.

265
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,260
<6-17,Howard>你跟我说了那么多他们的事
<6-17,Howard>You tell me tons of stuff about these guys,

266
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,380
<6-17,Howard>我从来都没说出去
<6-17,Howard>and I never repeat it.

267
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,680
<6-18,Penny>-你跟他说什么了  -没说啥
<6-18,Penny>- What do you tell him? - Oh,

268
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,180
<6-19,Bernadette>就一些枕边的私房话
<6-19,Bernadette>you know, just pillow talk.

269
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,340
<6-19,Bernadette>你们什么都不用担心
<6-19,Bernadette>You guys have nothing to worry about.

270
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,960
<6-20,Leonard>咱两相好时  你没跟人家说啥吧
<6-20,Leonard>Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?

271
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,840
<6-21,Penny>没有  你的小秘密我都没说过
<6-21,Penny>No. All your little secrets are fine.

272
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,150
<6-22,Bernadette>是啊  她绝对没说
<6-22,Bernadette>Yes, absolutely fine.

273
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,450
<6-23,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>我迟些再告诉你
<6-23,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>I'll tell you later.

274
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,440
<6-23,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>来吧  肿瘤

<7-1,Amy>Come on, tumor, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma.

276
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,470
<7-1,Amy>爽啊  脑瘤
<7-1,Amy>Yay, brain tumor!

277
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,010
<7-1,Amy>你得知有脑瘤时的反映估计跟我不一样
<7-1,Amy>Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.

278
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,160
<7-3,Bernadette>-嗨  -你好
<7-3,Bernadette>- Hi. - Hello.

281
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,130
<7-5,Penny>那天没叫上你一起去逛礼服
<7-5,Penny>for not bringing you with us the other day.

282
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,960
<7-6,Amy>没必要道歉  这就跟《芝麻街》里说的一样
<7-6,Amy>That's not necessary-- it's like Sesame Street says:

283
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,820
<7-6,Amy>"这个东西跟与众不同"
<7-6,Amy>"One of these things is not like the other,

284
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,720
<7-6,Amy>"这个东西将孤独终老"
<7-6,Amy>one of these things should die alone."

285
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,020
<7-7,Penny>别这样嘛  艾米  让我们补偿你
<7-7,Penny>Come on, Amy, let us make it up to you.

286
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,080
<7-7,Penny>咱们办个闺蜜之夜
<7-7,Penny>We'll have a girl's night;

287
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,280
<7-7,Penny>你想干啥咱就干啥
<7-7,Penny>we'll do whatever you want.

288
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,870
<7-8,Bernadette>我们可以去韩国洗浴中心
<7-8,Bernadette>We can go down to the Korean baths

289
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,400
<7-8,Bernadette>照你说的那样
<7-8,Bernadette>and do that thing you were talking about

290
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,130
<7-8,Bernadette>互相给对方搓澡
<7-8,Bernadette>where we wash each other.

291
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,280
<7-9,Penny>戴着丝瓜络手套搓  不是用手摸
<7-9,Penny>With-with loofah mitts, no hands.

292
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,600
<7-10,Amy>没关系  我很高兴发生这样的事
<7-10,Amy>It's okay. I'm glad this happened.

293
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,870
<7-10,Amy>我再也不用假装某个美女
<7-10,Amy>I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl

294
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,460
<7-10,Amy>和她找准角度还算可爱的朋友
<7-10,Amy>and her cute-in-the-right-light friend

295
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,020
<7-10,Amy>喜欢和我一起玩了
<7-10,Amy>want to hang out with me.

296
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,710
<7-11,Bernadette>艾米  我们真的很抱歉
<7-11,Bernadette>Amy, we're really sorry.

297
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,220
<7-12,Penny>对  我们觉得特内疚
<7-12,Penny>Yeah, we feel awful.

298
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,930
<7-13,Amy>别  我会没事的  你们也不是第一个
<7-13,Amy>Don't. I'll be okay. You're not the first girls

299
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,190
<7-13,Amy>我以为是我的朋友  结果处处躲着我的女孩子
<7-13,Amy>I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me.

300
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,790
<7-13,Amy>感觉就像回到了小学  初中
<7-13,Amy>It's like elementary school, junior high,

301
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,370
<7-13,Amy>高中  大学  研究院
<7-13,Amy>high school, undergrad, grad school,

302
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,100
<7-13,Amy>还有去挪威交换的那学期一样
<7-13,Amy>and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.

303
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,380
<7-14,Penny>别这样嘛  艾米
<7-14,Penny>Oh, come on, Amy.

304
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,600
<7-15,Amy>你不懂
<7-15,Amy>You don't get it.

305
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,830
<7-15,Amy>看看这个大脑
<7-15,Amy>Look at this brain.

306
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,070
<7-16,Penny>我实在不想看
<7-16,Penny>I don't really want to.

307
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,590
<7-17,Amy>这就像我们
<7-17,Amy>This is us.

308

<7-17,Amy>伯纳黛特  你就是善于
<7-17,Amy>Bernadette, you are the analytical,

309
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,240
<7-17,Amy>科学分析的左脑
<7-17,Amy>scientific left hemisphere.

310
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,430
<7-17,Amy>佩妮  你就是有自主创造力的右脑
<7-17,Amy>Penny, you're the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere.

00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,120
<7-17,Amy>没人愿意跟她一起去逛街
<7-17,Amy>no one wants to go dress shopping with.

314
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,380
<7-18,Bernadette>艾米  你不是肿瘤
<7-18,Bernadette>Amy, you're not a tumor.

<10-4,Penny>我没给过你友谊手镯
<10-4,Penny>I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
