1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,190
<1-1,Leonard>看咱哥俩  准备好去奔赴四人有约
<1-1,Leonard>Look at us, getting ready for a double date

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,150
<1-1,Leonard>并且她们以名副其实的女朋友身份
<1-1,Leonard>With actual women who publicly acknowledge

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,180
<1-1,Leonard>光明正大的来约会
<1-1,Leonard>They're our girlfriends.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,380
<1-2,Howard>没错  真女人最赞
<1-2,Howard>Yes, actual women are the best.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,930
<1-3,Sheldon>我就不明白了
<1-3,Sheldon>I don't understand.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,910
<1-3,Sheldon>难道还有其他种类的女人
<1-3,Sheldon>What other kind of women are there?

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,620
<1-4,Leonard>霍华德  人造女性是属于你的研究部门的
<1-4,Leonard>Howard, artificial women are your department.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,750
<1-4,Leonard>你要接这个茬吗
<1-4,Leonard>You want to take this?

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,480
<1-5,Howard>才不咧  那会吓坏他的
<1-5,Howard>No, it would just freak him out.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,230
<1-5,Howard>听着  在出发之前
<1-5,Howard>Listen, before we leave,

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,280
<1-5,Howard>我要警告你  我是个热情的男人
<1-5,Howard>I should warn you, I'm a passionate man

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,680
<1-5,Howard>倾向于公开地表达我炙热的感情
<1-5,Howard>And I tend towards public displays of affection.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,580
<1-6,Leonard>你到底想说什么啊  霍华德
<1-6,Leonard>What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,660
<1-7,Howard>我会在车里或餐厅里缠绵一下
<1-7,Howard>There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant,

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,560
<1-7,Howard>而且我不想让伯纳黛特感到不安
<1-7,Howard>And I don't want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable,

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,210
<1-7,Howard>所以如果你和佩妮也打啵儿的话会有所帮助的
<1-7,Howard>So it would help if you and Penny made out, too.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,010
<1-8,Leonard>别担心
<1-8,Leonard>Don't worry.

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,330
<1-8,Leonard>我们正打算在沙拉吧上云雨一番咧
<1-8,Leonard>We're planning to have sex right on the salad bar.

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,850
<1-9,Raj (arriving)>晚上好  白种人

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,930
<1-9,Raj (arriving)>我租到了四小时特别版的《守望者》
<1-9,Raj (arriving)>I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.

<1-11,Howard>-我有了  -看过了
<1-11,Howard>- Got it.  - Seen it.

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,880
<1-13,Raj>那...我们今晚干嘛
<1-13,Raj>Well, then what are we going to do tonight?

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,110
<1-14,Leonard>不好意思哈  拉杰

<1-14,Leonard>- With penny and bernadette.  - Yeah.

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,480
<1-15,Howard>我和莱纳德告别无忧无虑的单身生活了
<1-15,Howard>No more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,520
<1-15,Howard>咱这两匹野马算是彻底从良了
<1-15,Howard>These broncos have been saddled.

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,530
<1-16,Leonard>我们是怎么勾到真正的女人的
<1-16,Leonard>How did we get actual women?

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,950
<1-16,Leonard>真棒
<1-16,Leonard>Great.

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,940
<1-17,Raj>难道他们就这么见色忘义
<1-17,Raj>They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,430
<1-18,Sheldon>这很好哇  不是吗
<1-18,Sheldon>It is great, isn't it?

34
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,060
<1-18,Sheldon>-一个美妙的夜晚就在前方  -是吗
<1-18,Sheldon>- We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.  - We do?

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,210
<1-19,Raj>那是  我才发现我没有
<1-19,Raj>Oh, yes. I just discovered I don't have

36
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,540
<1-20,Sheldon>足够的硬盘空间分配给Linux系统
<1-20,Sheldon>Enough room ony hard drive for a Linux partition,

37
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,930
<1-20,Sheldon>所以你和我要做一份全套备份
<1-20,Sheldon>So you and I are going to perform a full backup,

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,880
<1-22,Sheldon>初始化然后重装我的所有操作系统
<1-22,Sheldon>Reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,210
<1-21,Raj>我才不想做那个咧
<1-21,Raj>I don't want to do that.

40
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,080
<1-21,Raj>好吧
<1-21,Raj>All right.

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,940
<1-22,Sheldon>那我要做一份全套备份
<1-22,Sheldon>Well, I'm going to perform full backup,

42
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,690
<1-22,Sheldon>初始化然后重装我的所有操作系统
<1-22,Sheldon>Reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.

43
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,260
<1-23,Raj>那我呢
<1-23,Raj>What about me

44
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,890
<1-24,Sheldon>嗯...我刚了解到有好几种类型的人造女性
<1-24,Sheldon>Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women.

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,340
<1-24,Sheldon>也许你应该关注一下那方面
<1-24,Sheldon>Maybe you should look into that.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,800
<1-24,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-24,Sheldon>第三季第十二集

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,830
<2-1,Raj>老兄  今晚有太多很酷的事情
<2-1,Raj>Dude, there's so many cool things

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,910
<2-1,Raj>等着我们去玩呢  看
<2-1,Raj>We could be doing tonight. Look.

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,620
<2-1,Raj>在幽谷拱廊商场
<2-1,Raj>At the glendale galleria,

50
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,470
<2-1,Raj>"穿上你最正的阻特装
<2-1,Raj>"Put on your best zoot suit

52
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,420
<2-1,Raj>在梅西百货附近的中央广场向摇摆音乐致敬
<2-1,Raj>"It's a salute to swing music in the center court near macy's.

53
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,670
<2-1,Raj>晚五点到九点
<2-1,Raj>5 p.M. To 9 p.M."

54
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,800
<2-1,Raj>怎么样  如何
<2-1,Raj>Huh? Huh?

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,510
<2-1,Raj>向阻特装的致敬
<2-1,Raj>A salute to zoot.

56
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,130
<2-1,Raj>听起来像是猫头鹰
<2-1,Raj>Sounds like a hoot.

57
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,210
<2-1,Raj>不好意思  拉杰
<2-1,Raj>I'm sorry, Raj,

58
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,470
<2-2,Sheldon>我今晚没有向任何类型服装致敬的欲望
<2-2,Sheldon>I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight.

59
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,640
<2-2,Sheldon>更何况这还涉及到四十年代的种族暴乱
<2-2,Sheldon>Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s.

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,440
<2-3,Raj>种族暴乱
<2-3,Raj>Race riots?

61
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,980
<2-4,Sheldon>阻特装暴动
<2-4,Sheldon>The zoot suit riots.

62
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,290
<2-4,Sheldon>啊哈
<2-4,Sheldon>Oh.

63
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,570
<2-5,Raj>我一直以为那是什么圣诞节后的减价活动
<2-5,Raj>I always thought that was some sort of after-christmas sale.

64
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,480
<2-5,Raj>那为什么不单纯地到拱廊商场散散步呢
<2-5,Raj>Well, then why don't we just go to the galleria and walk around?

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,330
<2-6,Sheldon>我又不需要那里面的东西
<2-6,Sheldon>But I don't need anything at the galleria.

66
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,830
<2-6,Sheldon>你在拱廊商场有何需求
<2-6,Sheldon>Do you need anything at the galleria?

67
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,300
<2-7,Raj>没  我们就随便走走看看怎么回事而已
<2-7,Raj>No. We would just walk around and see what's what.

68
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,480
<2-8,Sheldon>这在语义上是个无效的句子
<2-8,Sheldon>That's a semantically null sentence.

69
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,980
<2-9,Raj>那好吧  嗯...那这个如何
<2-9,Raj>Okay, well, how about this?

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,470
<2-9,Raj>大学网站上的
<2-9,Raj>From the university web site:

74
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,360
<2-9,Raj>"不论你是分解原子还是分解不定式
<2-9,Raj>"Whether you split atoms or infinitives,

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,130
<2-9,Raj>这是你必到的聚会
<2-9,Raj>This is the place to be."

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,820
<2-10,Sheldon>这当然是很幽默 但...
<2-10,Sheldon>Well, that's certainly amusing, but...

77
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,420
<2-10,Sheldon>但我没兴趣
<2-10,Sheldon>I have no interest.

78
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,740
<2-11,Raj>别这样  谢尔顿
<2-11,Raj>Come on, Sheldon,

79
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,110
<2-11,Raj>这个世界上充满了在室外活动的人

<2-11,Raj>Let's go outside.

81
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,270
<2-11,Raj>外面多美好
<2-11,Raj>Outside is good.

82
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,670
<2-12,Sheldon>要是外面这么美好  那为什么人类花费上千年
<2-12,Sheldon>Outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years

83
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,470
<2-12,Sheldon>来完美内部装饰
<2-12,Sheldon>Trying to perfect inside?

84
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,290
<2-13,Raj>我咋知道  也许是营销计划
<2-13,Raj>I don't know, it's a marketing scheme.

85

<2-14,Sheldon>那我提供个妥协方案
<2-14,Sheldon>Let me offer you a compromise.

<2-14,Sheldon>当我感到憋闷  想换换视野的时候
<2-14,Sheldon>Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery,

90
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,670

95
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,100
<2-17,Raj>《平地》里有描述过

96
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,510
<2-17,Raj>我才不想去平地
<2-17,Raj>I don't want to go to flatland.

97
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,710
<2-18,Sheldon>你这么说只是因为你还没去过那里
<2-18,Sheldon>You're only saying that becae you haven't been there.

98
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,090
<2-18,Sheldon>我现在是二维空间里的一个六边形
<2-18,Sheldon>I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space

<3-3,Howard>What does that tell you?

121
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,230
<3-4,Penny>为了上她二垒这个极小的可能性
<3-4,Penny>That you'd be willing to die a horrible death

122
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,620
<3-4,Penny>你愿意尸骨无存地死去?
<3-4,Penny>On the off-chance you'd get to second base?

123
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,610
<3-5,Bernadette>我们已经远不止是二垒的关系了
<3-5,Bernadette>Oh, we're way past second base.

124
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,080
<3-5,Bernadette>对吧  亲爱的?
<3-5,Bernadette>Right, Howard?

125
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,800
<3-6,Howard>虽然我们对各垒的位置
<3-6,Howard>Well, we kind of disagree

126
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,750
<3-6,Howard>有些分歧
<3-6,Howard>About what the bases are.

127

<3-7,Bernadette>佩妮  你工作怎么样?
<3-7,Bernadette>How's your work going, penny?

<3-8,Penny>Of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley.

131
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,550
<3-8,Penny>但我觉得我的转机马上要来了
<3-8,Penny>But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.

<3-11,Leonard>好吧
<3-11,Leonard>Okay.

136
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,520
<3-12,Penny>一个通灵师告诉我  如果我剪了头发
<3-12,Penny>Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair,

<3-16,Leonard>噢  你干吗不早说?
<3-16,Leonard>Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,020
<3-16,Leonard>又不是人人都有资格申请网站的
<3-16,Leonard>They don't let just anyone have a web site.

145
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,390
<3-17,Penny>-你干吗这么刻薄?  -你觉得奇怪?
<3-17,Penny>- Why are you being such a jerk?  - You're surprised?

<5-13,Howard>你觉得呢  他们小两口矛盾
<5-13,Howard>What do you think-- want to jump

240
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,430
<5-13,Howard>我们要搅这趟浑水吗
<5-13,Howard>right in the middle of another couple's argument?

241
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,470
<5-14,Bernadette>不了  谢谢
<5-14,Bernadette>No, thank you.

242
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,670
<5-15,Howard>爱莫能助
<5-15,Howard>Sorry.

243
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,850
<5-16,Leonard>我想我们别谈这个话题了
<5-16,Leonard>Maybe we suld just stop talking about this.

244
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,860
<5-17,Penny>我还是觉得我们都闭嘴好了
<5-17,Penny>Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.

245
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,280
<5-18,Waiter>今晚用餐如何
<5-18,Waiter>How is everything tonight?

246
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,190
<5-19,Bernadette>相当郁闷
<5-19,Bernadette>Really uncomfortable.

247
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,390
<6-1,Leonard>稳定而互相支持的一夫一妻关系中
<6-1,Leonard>You know, the best thing about being in a committed,

248
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,350
<6-1,Leonard>最大的优点就在于
<6-1,Leonard>monogamous, mutually supportive relationship

249
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,300
<6-1,Leonard>即使两人发生分歧
<6-1,Leonard>is that even if you have different idea,

250
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,890
<6-1,Leonard>并经过激烈辩论  但感情不受影响
<6-1,Leonard>you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for,

251
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,460
<6-1,Leonard>甚至吵过后还是可以云雨一番...
<6-1,Leonard>even make love with...

252
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,420
<6-1,Leonard>不要鱼了吗
<6-1,Leonard>Want your fish?

253
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,700
<6-1,Leonard>我不用是灵媒
<6-1,Leonard>I knew you were going to do that.

254
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,040
<6-1,Leonard>也能猜到你会这样
<6-1,Leonard>Doesn't make me psychic!

255
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,700
<6-1,Leonard>好吧  你这废柴只会把事情越弄越糟
<6-1,Leonard>Attaboy, Leonard make it worse.

256
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,500
<6-2,Leonard>什么情况
<6-2,Leonard>What's going on?

257
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,680
<6-3,Sheldon>我们找到女人了
<6-3,Sheldon>We scored.

258
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,230
<6-3,Sheldon>我助攻的
<6-3,Sheldon>I'm the wingman.

259
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,280
<7-2,Leonard (handing him protective glasses)>好啊
<7-2,Leonard (handing him protective glasses)>Hey.

260
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,200
<7-3,Howard>-戴上  防镭射  -难忘一宵啊
<7-3,Howard>- Laser.  - Had a great night last night.

261
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,790
<7-3,Howard>我是不想透露太多啦
<7-3,Howard>I don't like to kiss and tell,

262
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,980
<7-3,Howard>但某些人已经上了八垒了哦
<7-3,Howard>but somebody made it to eighth base.

263
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,620
<7-4,Leonard>八垒是个什么情况
<7-4,Leonard>What the hell is eighth base?

264
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,810
<7-5,Howard>七垒只到宽衣解带
<7-5,Howard>Seventh base with shirt off.

265
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,970
<7-5,Howard>宽的还是我的衣
<7-5,Howard>Well, my shirt.

266
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,350
<7-5,Howard>你和佩妮咋样了
<7-5,Howard>How'd things go with Penny?

267
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,430
<7-6,Leonard>好得不能再好了
<7-6,Leonard>Oh... couldn't be better.

268
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,010
<7-7,Howard>我们感情生活一不顺
<7-7,Howard>Are we taking our relationship

269
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,500
<7-7,Howard>就拿无辜的赛昂人出气吗
<7-7,Howard>frustrations out on innocent Cylons?

270
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,950
<7-8,Leonard>可不止赛昂人呢
<7-8,Leonard>It's not just Cylons.

271
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,690
<7-8,Leonard>接下来就轮到超人了
<7-8,Leonard>Superman's next.

272
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,630
<7-9,Howard>好吧  我本想在吃午饭前
<7-9,Howard>All right, I was going to try to squeeze in

273
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,320
<7-9,Howard>溜过来吐吐槽
<7-9,Howard>a little more mocking before lunch,

274
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,140
<7-9,Howard>但我想我还是识相点撤吧
<7-9,Howard>but I can come back later

275
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,320
<7-9,Howard>免得被你的杀伤性武器给殃及了
<7-9,Howard>when you don't have a high-powered weapon.

276
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,660
<7-10,Leonard>我怎么能和信灵媒的女孩子约会呢
<7-10,Leonard>How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?

277
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,730
<7-11,Howard>这有啥  我以前泡过一个妞
<7-11,Howard>Hey, I once dated a girl

278
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,170
<7-11,Howard>她还相信自己被外星人绑架过
<7-11,Howard>who believed she was abducted by aliens.

279
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,560
<7-12,Leonard>你就不介意吗
<7-12,Leonard>And that didn'bother you?

280
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
<7-13,Howard>正相反[法语]
<7-13,Howard>Au contraire.

281
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,430
<7-13,Howard>说明她好骗又值得"深探"一番
<7-13,Howard>It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.

282
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,240
<7-14,Leonard>我该咋办
<7-14,Leonard>What am I supposed to,

283
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,070
<7-14,Leonard>和佩妮一起时我就得装着相信吗
<7-14,Leonard>Pretend I believe something I don't whenever I'm with Penny?

284
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,000
<7-15,Howard>我肯定佩妮和你一起时
<7-15,Howard>Yes, I'm sure Penny fakes all kinds of things

285
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,870
<7-15,Howard>她也不都是装出来的吗
<7-15,Howard>when she's with you.

286
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,730
<7-16,Leonard>帮个忙  怎么都好  让我爆了你
<7-16,Leonard>Do me a favor-- lean or, put your head right here.

287
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,400
<7-17,Howard>换种说法和你解释吧
<7-17,Howard>Let me show you anothe way to look at this.

288
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,320
<7-17,Howard>这里是全宇宙的女人
<7-17,Howard>Here we have the universe of all women.

289
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,680
<7-17,Howard>其中这一部分的女人
<7-17,Howard>These are the ones

290
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,940
<7-17,Howard>你想和她们上床
<7-17,Howard>you want to sleep with.

291
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,080
<7-17,Howard>而这里的女人则与你的想法如出一辙
<7-17,Howard>These are the women who believe exactly what you believe.

292
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,960
<7-17,Howard>而只有这点女人愿意和你上床
<7-17,Howard>These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you.

293
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,750
<7-17,Howard>而你的理想伴侣
<7-17,Howard>And right there in the little triple intersection...

294
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,360
<7-17,Howard>只能从这三者之间小小的交集中找了
<7-17,Howard>is your ideal mate.

295
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,980
<7-18,Leonard>而你的那个她可能是个又矮又自卑的物理学家
<7-18,Leonard>Odds are she's a short physicist with low self-esteem

296
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,060
<7-18,Leonard>还是在为中国政府研究所工作
<7-18,Leonard>who lives in a government research facility in china.

297
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,710
<7-18,Leonard>你到底想说啥
<7-18,Leonard>What's your point?

298
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,160
<7-18,Leonard>为了和佩妮继续交往下去
<7-18,Leonard>In order to keep hing a sexual relationship with Penny,

299
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
<7-18,Leonard>我就得放弃
<7-18,Leonard>I have to give up everything I believe in--

300
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,610
<7-18,Leonard>我对科学知识的信仰
<7-18,Leonard>my intellectual integrity, the very nature

301
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,540
<7-18,Leonard>和我的本性吗
<7-18,Leonard>of who I am?

302
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,430
<7-18,Leonard>我做不到  霍华德
<7-18,Leonard>I can't do that, Howard.

303
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,190
<7-19,Howard>完全理解
<7-19,Howard>I respect that.

304
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,240
<7-20,Leonard>那是什么
<7-20,Leonard>What is that?

305
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
<7-21,Howard>你的新女友
<7-21,Howard>Your new girlfriend.

306
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,760
<7-21,Howard>祝你今晚愉快
<7-21,Howard>Have fun tonight.

307
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,670
<8-1,Sheldon>狗狗
<8-1,Sheldon>The dog...

310
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,350
<8-1,Sheldon>屋顶
<8-1,Sheldon>The roof...

312
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,260
<8-1,Sheldon>葡萄
<8-1,Sheldon>Grapes...

314
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,940
<8-1,Sheldon>等一下
<8-1,Sheldon>One minute.

316
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,410
<8-2,Raj>什么意思
<8-2,Raj>What was that?

317
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,880
<8-3,Sheldon>是指"请进"
<8-3,Sheldon>It means "Come in."

318
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,160
<8-3,Sheldon>我电脑在装新的操作系统
<8-3,Sheldon>It's taking forever to load

319
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,250
<8-3,Sheldon>等的时间太久了
<8-3,Sheldon>The new operating system on my computer.

320
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,330
<8-3,Sheldon>我消毒了厨房和卫生间
<8-3,Sheldon>I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom,

321
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,660
<8-3,Sheldon>索性就来学习芬兰语吧
<8-3,Sheldon>And now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

322
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,110
<8-4,Raj>那是印度语
<8-4,Raj>That's Hindi for

323
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,990
<8-4,Raj>就是说你爱咋咋滴吧
<8-4,Raj>"Whatever floats your bought."

324
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,190
<8-4,Raj>我收到艾比发来的短信
<8-4,Raj>Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby,

325
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,650
<8-4,Raj>她跟她朋友玛莎  还想跟我们出去玩
<8-4,Raj>And she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again.

326
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,010
<8-4,Raj>你怎么说
<8-4,Raj>What do you say?

327
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,330
<8-5,Sheldon>我什么都不会说
<8-5,Sheldon>I don't say anything.

328
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,120
<8-5,Sheldon>只会提醒你  你这个表情
<8-5,Sheldon>I merely offer you facial expression

329
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,290
<8-5,Sheldon>说明你走火入魔了
<8-5,Sheldon>That suggests you've gone insane

330
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,230
<8-6,Raj>我不明白  你明明也很开心的啊
<8-6,Raj>I don't get it.You had a great time.

331
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,350
<8-7,Sheldon>没错  我是玩得很开心
<8-7,Sheldon>Yes, exactly, I had a great time.

332
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,400
<8-7,Sheldon>但完了就完了  我就找其他事做了
<8-7,Sheldon>That's done; I've moved on to other things.

333
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,020
<8-7,Sheldon>比如说  等我学会了芬兰语
<8-7,Sheldon>For example, after I learn Finnish,

334
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,100
<8-7,Sheldon>我是不会再去学一遍的
<8-7,Sheldon>I'm not going to learn Finnish again

335
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,950
<8-8,Raj>求你了  谢尔顿  我这个无助的印度男孩
<8-8,Raj>Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy

336
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,080
<8-8,Raj>远离故土  就想交个女朋友
<8-8,Raj>Far from home, and I want a girlfriend

337
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,420
<8-8,Raj>想让艾比当我女朋友
<8-8,Raj>And I want her to be Abby,

338
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,760
<8-8,Raj>但除非能带上玛莎  不然她是不会出来的
<8-8,Raj>And she'll only come over if she can bring Martha.

339
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,870
<8-9,Sheldon>拉杰  我强烈怀疑你能提出什么论据
<8-9,Sheldon>Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make,

340
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,430
<8-9,Sheldon>或许你可以试试威胁我  运用夸张策略
<8-9,Sheldon>Threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy,

341
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,170
<8-9,Sheldon>恳求我  给我施法
<8-9,Sheldon>Plea, invocation,

342
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,700
<8-9,Sheldon>跟我祈祷  芬兰语是vetoomus
<8-9,Sheldon>Supplication, or... vetoomus

343
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,950
<8-9,Sheldon>不如试试这几招  说服我再考虑下
<8-9,Sheldon>That you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.

345
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,250
<8-10,Raj>斯坦·李亲笔签名的"神奇绿巨人"手套
<8-10,Raj>My Incredible Hulk hand signed by Stan Lee.

346
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,310
<8-11,Sheldon>天哪
<8-11,Sheldon>Oh, my.

347
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,800
<8-11,Sheldon>这是我多年梦寐以求的
<8-11,Sheldon>I've admired these for years.

348
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,450
<8-12,Raj>也就是说你肯再次跟我出去见她们了
<8-12,Raj>So does that mean we can go with the girls again?

349
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,350
<8-13,Sheldon>绿巨人同意再次跟弱小的人类约会
<8-13,Sheldon>Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!

350
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,340
<8-14,Raj>约会时你可不能戴那手套
<8-14,Raj>You can't wear the hands on the date.

351
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,000
<8-15,Sheldon>绿巨人伤心了
<8-15,Sheldon>Hulk sad.

352
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,740
<9-1,Leonard>你清理干净了烘干机滤出来的绒毛
<9-1,Leonard>Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

353
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,410
<9-1,Leonard>不但是种礼貌之举
<9-1,Leonard>Not only is it courteous,

354
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,100
<9-1,Leonard>更增加了安全系数
<9-1,Leonard>It's safety smart.

355
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,820
<9-1,Leonard>每年都有一万五千起火灾
<9-1,Leonard>Every year, 15,000 fires are caused

356
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,130
<9-1,Leonard>是由烘干机上的绒毛突然起火导致的
<9-1,Leonard>By accidental dryer lint ignition.

357
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,900
<9-1,Leonard>现在你该接下去说
<9-1,Leonard>Now you're supposed to say,

358
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,800
<9-1,Leonard>哇  真是个有趣的事实
<9-1,Leonard>"Wow, what an interesting fact.

359
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,900
<9-1,Leonard>过来吧  你这小呆瓜
<9-1,Leonard>"Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.

360
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,230
<9-1,Leonard>我怎么都不会生你气的
<9-1,Leonard>I could never be mad at you."

361
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,650
<9-2,Penny>哇  你就想明白了这些吗
<9-2,Penny>Wow, that's all you got

362
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,360
<9-2,Penny>你可是在我们四人约会的时候
<9-2,Penny>After you were the most obnoxious person

363
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,730
