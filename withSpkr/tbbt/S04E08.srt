1
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,930
<1-1,Penny>谁给我解释一下
<1-1,Penny>Okay, help me out here.

2
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,600
<1-1,Penny>一位考古学教授怎么会把鞭子玩得那么溜
<1-1,Penny>How does an archeology professor get that good with a whip?

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,100
<1-2,Howard>估计是在成人书店学的吧[暗指SM]
<1-2,Howard>Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore.

4
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,770
<1-2,Howard>反正我是这么学的
<1-2,Howard>That's how I learned.

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,580
<1-3,Leonard>真不敢相信你居然没看过《法柜奇兵》
<1-3,Leonard>I can't believe you've never seen  Raiders of the Lost Ark.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,350
<1-4,Penny>我也不敢相信你居然没看过《饭·祷·爱》
<1-4,Penny>And I can't believe you've never read  Eat, Pray, Love.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,980
<1-5,Leonard>要是写一本
<1-5,Leonard>When she comes out with

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,580
<1-5,Leonard>《吃饭·祈祷·躲避大滚石》  我就看
<1-5,Leonard>Eat, Pray, Run Away From A   Giant Boulder, I'll read it.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,450
<1-6,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>我才不管《饭·祷·爱》对你的人生有多大影响呢
<1-6,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life,

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,660
<1-6,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>我才不看呢
<1-6,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>I'm not reading it.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,690
<1-7,Penny>知道吗  我也能那么转帽子
<1-7,Penny>You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,460
<1-8,Sheldon>那可是著名的好莱坞服装设计师德博拉·纳杜曼的
<1-8,Sheldon>That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,530
<1-8,Sheldon>杰作
<1-8,Sheldon>Deborah Nadoolman.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,870
<1-8,Sheldon>她还设计了
<1-8,Sheldon>She also designed

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,270
<1-8,Sheldon>迈克尔·杰克逊的《战栗》的MV中
<1-8,Sheldon>the iconic red and black jacket

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,070
<1-8,Sheldon>那件经典的红黑夹克
<1-8,Sheldon>in Michael Jackson's Thriller video,

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,070
<1-8,Sheldon>不过我一直没看完MV
<1-8,Sheldon>which I've never viewed in its entirety,

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,510
<1-8,Sheldon>因为我觉得一群僵尸
<1-8,Sheldon>as I find zombies dancing

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,910
<1-8,Sheldon>跳舞这么整齐实在是太假了
<1-8,Sheldon>in choreographed synchronicity implausible.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,350
<1-8,Sheldon>而且  真的好吓人啊
<1-8,Sheldon>And also, it's really scary.

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,450
<1-9,Leonard>麻烦哪位帮忙把谢尔顿评论音轨给关掉吧
<1-9,Leonard>Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,190
<1-10,Sheldon>不好意思没有开关  你就好好听着
<1-10,Sheldon>There's no switch. Just listen and learn.

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,750
<1-11,Howard>佩妮  如果你觉得这片子不错的话
<1-11,Howard>Penny, if you think this is good,

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,220
<1-11,Howard>你可以周五和我们一起
<1-11,Howard>you should come with us Friday

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,090
<1-11,Howard>在科洛尼奥电影院的大屏幕上再看一遍
<1-11,Howard>to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.

29
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,390
<1-12,Penny>我现在就在看啊
<1-12,Penny>Well, I'm watching it now.

30
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,860
<1-12,Penny>干嘛还要周五再看一遍
<1-12,Penny>Why would I want to see it again on Friday?

31
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,700
<1-13,Sheldon>因为周五那场的胶片
<1-13,Sheldon>Because the print they're showing on Friday

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
<1-13,Sheldon>有首次公映的21秒加长镜头哦
<1-13,Sheldon>has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,840
<1-14,Penny>什么  21秒  那不就像是看一部全新的电影了吗
<1-14,Penny>What? 21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,870
<1-15,Leonard>没错
<1-15,Leonard>Exactly.

35
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,640
<1-15,Leonard>据说加长片段能解释关于潜艇的争论
<1-15,Leonard>They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,380
<1-16,Sheldon>莱纳德
<1-16,Sheldon>Did-- Leonard?

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,480
<1-16,Sheldon>我不确定哈  但是我觉得
<1-16,Sheldon>I'm no expert, but I believe

38
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,280
<1-16,Sheldon>佩妮刚才那话是在讽刺咱们
<1-16,Sheldon>what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,150
<1-16,Sheldon>哇  又猜对了
<1-16,Sheldon>Oh! Good.

40
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,280
<1-16,Sheldon>本月26中8了
<1-16,Sheldon>I'm 8 for 26 this month.

41
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,520
<1-17,Penny>嗯  我还是算了吧
<1-17,Penny>Yeah, I think I'll pass.

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,460
<1-17,Penny>你们几位好好享受这21秒吧
<1-17,Penny>But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.

43
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,890
<1-18,Leonard>要是我能让你能明白
<1-18,Leonard>Bet if I could make you understand

44
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,160
<1-18,Leonard>这玩意儿有多酷的话  咱俩肯定还在一起
<1-18,Leonard>why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.

45
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,660
<1-19,Penny>嗯  没错  不  不可能了
<1-19,Penny>Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.

46
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,070
<1-20,Howard>对
<1-20,Howard>Uh-huh.

47
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,040
<1-20,Howard>我猜佩妮这"21秒"跟"那个"也有关系
<1-20,Howard>I'm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.

48
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,300
<1-20,Howard>生活大爆炸
<1-20,Howard>第四季第八集

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,040
<2-1,Sheldon>请允许我指出
<2-1,Sheldon>May I point out to you all

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,340
<2-1,Sheldon>电影院的座位都是先到先得的
<2-1,Sheldon>that the screening is "first come, first served"?

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,940
<2-2,Leonard>淡定  现在才5点  电影12点才开始
<2-2,Leonard>Relax, it's 5:00. The movie doesn't start till midnight.

52
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,310
<2-3,Sheldon>但要是换种说法
<2-3,Sheldon>Another way of saying that is

53
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,380
<2-3,Sheldon>"电影12点开演  现在已经5点了"
<2-3,Sheldon>"the movie starts at midnight, and it's already 5:00."

54
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,920
<2-3,Sheldon>咱们出发吧
<2-3,Sheldon>Let's go.

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,990
<2-4,Howard>如果我们没赶上的话  我们下半辈子
<2-4,Howard>You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of

56
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,290
<2-4,Howard>就能享受谢尔顿无休止的抱怨悔恨了
<2-4,Howard>listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.

57
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,120
<2-5,Sheldon>看见没  霍华德也等不及了
<2-5,Sheldon>See? Howard's on my side.

58
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,830
<2-6,Howard>其实我不是那意思
<2-6,Howard>Actually, I'm not.

59
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,800
<2-6,Howard>我是用讽刺手法调戏你
<2-6,Howard>I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

60
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,670
<2-7,Sheldon>靠  跌到27中8了
<2-7,Sheldon>Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.

61
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,700
<2-8,Leonard>别担心了  谢尔顿  我们能赶上的
<2-8,Leonard>Don't worry, Sheldon.We'll be fine.

62
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,670
<2-9,Sheldon>上次和我一起排了14小时队的
<2-9,Sheldon>What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter

63
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,110
<2-9,Sheldon>莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德怎么了
<2-9,Sheldon>who waited in line with me for 14 hours

64
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,310
<2-9,Sheldon>去看《星际迷航:复仇女神》的午夜首映那次
<2-9,Sheldon>to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?

65
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,110
<2-10,Leonard>哦  他排了14个小时的队
<2-10,Leonard>Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours,

66
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,710
<2-10,Leonard>而你却在躺椅上睡大觉
<2-10,Leonard>while you napped in a lawn chair,

67
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,380
<2-10,Leonard>他在离队去尿尿的时候
<2-10,Leonard>he got in a fight with a Klingon

68
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,020
<2-10,Leonard>和一个克林贡人吵了起来
<2-10,Leonard>when he stepped out of line to pee

69
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,880
<2-10,Leonard>而你却不愿起来证明他没有插队
<2-10,Leonard>and you wouldn't wake up to vouch for him,

70
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,250
<2-10,Leonard>最恶劣的是  他还看了《星际迷航:复仇女神》
<2-10,Leonard>and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.

71
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,390
<2-11,Sheldon>但我俩的座位如何
<2-11,Sheldon>But how were our seats?

72
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,460
<2-12,Leonard>相当好
<2-12,Leonard>Excellent.

73
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,060
<2-13,Sheldon>那不就结了
<2-13,Sheldon>I rest my case.

74
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,500
<2-13,Sheldon>艾米  你难道不觉得我们现在就该去排队吗
<2-13,Sheldon>Amy, don't you agree we should leave now and get in line?

75
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,170
<2-14,Amy>其实作为你们这个社交团体的最新成员
<2-14,Amy>Actually, as the newest member of your social group,

76
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,370
<2-14,Amy>我觉得偶尔偏向你们的朋友们一方
<2-14,Amy>I believe I'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily

77
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,670
<2-14,Amy>更能让我融入你们
<2-14,Amy>siding with your friends from time to time.

78
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,670
<2-15,Sheldon>真阴险
<2-15,Sheldon>Shrewd.

79
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,280
<2-16,Amy>莱纳德  你说得对
<2-16,Amy>Leonard, you're right.

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
<2-16,Amy>我们就应该好好享受完美食再过去
<2-16,Amy>We should enjoy our meal, arrive late,

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,950
<2-16,Amy>冒着最后坐上超烂座位的风险
<2-16,Amy>and risk winding up with terrible seats,

82
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,010
<2-16,Amy>当然  前提是我们都能进得去
<2-16,Amy>assuming we get in at all.

83
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,720
<2-17,Leonard>多谢了  艾米
<2-17,Leonard>Thank you, Amy.

84
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,320
<2-18,Amy>看见了吧  很管用的

88
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,390
<2-22,Howard>我也爱你
<2-22,Howard>Olive you, too.

89
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,730
<2-23,Leonard>二位  这有点儿太俗了吧
<2-23,Leonard>Guys, that's really starting to get old.

90
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,860
<2-19,Bernadette>咚咚咚
<2-19,Bernadette>Knock-knock.

<2-29,Howard>So. Are you sure you don't want to come with us to Raiders?

<2-30,Bernadette>不去了  那部片子里有熔化的人脸
<2-30,Bernadette>Oh, no. That movie has melting faces.

<2-30,Bernadette>总是会让我想起
<2-30,Bernadette>It reminds me too much of the time

99
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,750
<2-30,Bernadette>我上次把一小瓶食肉细菌
<2-30,Bernadette>I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria

<2-42,Penny>Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.

119
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,840
<2-43,Amy>有什么着装要求
<2-43,Amy>What's the dress code?

120
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,780
<2-44,Penny>穿你觉得舒服的衣服就行
<2-44,Penny>Uh, just wear something comfortable.

121
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,580
<2-45,Amy>好的  我得去买几件才行了
<2-45,Amy>All right. I'll have to go shopping.

122
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,520
<2-46,Sheldon>咚咚咚
<2-46,Sheldon>Knock-knock.

123
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,620
<2-48,Sheldon>谁呀
<2-48,Sheldon>Who is there?

124
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,220
<2-49,Leonard>-休  -休什么
<2-49,Leonard>- Hugh.  - Hugh who?

125
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,920
<2-50,Sheldon>休·大家都得听我的
<2-50,Sheldon>Hugh people need to listen to me.

126
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,530
<2-50,Sheldon>该去排队看电影了
<2-50,Sheldon>It's time to get in line for the movie.

127
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,960
<2-50,Sheldon>你们这种敲门游戏就应该这么玩的
<2-50,Sheldon>And that's how you tell a knock-knock joke.

128
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,810
<3-1,Sheldon>一般情况下  我会说"告诉过你们啦"
<3-1,Sheldon>Under normal circumstances I'd say, "I told you so".

129
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,010
<3-1,Sheldon>但是既然我已经无数次
<3-1,Sheldon>But as I have told you so

130
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,540
<3-1,Sheldon>愤怒地告诉过你们了
<3-1,Sheldon>with such vehemence and frequency already,

131
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,610
<3-1,Sheldon>所以现在这句话已经没有意义了
<3-1,Sheldon>the phrase has lost all meaning.

132
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,250
<3-1,Sheldon>因此  我要换种说法
<3-1,Sheldon>Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase:

133
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,620
<3-3,Sheldon>我已经如是告知过你们了
<3-3,Sheldon>"I informed you thusly".

134
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,390
<3-2,Howard>啊  那我真是等不及了
<3-2,Howard>Ooh. Can't wait for that to start.

135
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,690
<3-3,Sheldon>我已经如是告知过你们了
<3-3,Sheldon>I informed you thusly.

136
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,190
<3-4,Raj>28中8了
<3-4,Raj>8 for 28.

137
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,090
<3-5,Sheldon>我们要是没去吃晚饭的话
<3-5,Sheldon>This is where we could have been

138
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,060
<3-5,Sheldon>现在就应该站在这儿
<3-5,Sheldon>if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

139
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,230
<3-5,Sheldon>要是库萨帕里没点甜品的话
<3-5,Sheldon>This is where we could have been

140
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,600
<3-5,Sheldon>我们现在就应该站在这儿
<3-5,Sheldon>if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,670
<3-6,Raj>那是我应得的老兄  我把西兰花都吃掉了
<3-6,Raj>Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.

142
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,840
<3-7,Sheldon>现在我们只能站在这儿  作为人海一粟
<3-7,Sheldon>And here's where we are. The runts in a large litter.

143
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,510
<3-7,Sheldon>永远也赶不上
<3-7,Sheldon>Unlikely to ever reach

144
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,550
<3-7,Sheldon>印第安纳·琼斯的精彩视觉盛宴了
<3-7,Sheldon>the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.

145
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,420
<3-8,Leonard>看来幸好我们吃了晚餐
<3-8,Leonard>So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner.

146
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,390
<3-9,Raj>伙计们  当面对沮丧时
<3-9,Raj>You know, guys, when facing disappointment,

147
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,590
<3-9,Raj>《饭·祷·爱》教导我们
<3-9,Raj>Eat, Pray, Loveteaches us --

148
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,160
<3-10,Howard>闭嘴吧
<3-10,Howard>Oh, shut up.

149
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,930
<4-1,Amy>总而言之  长话短说
<4-1,Amy>...So anyway, to make a long story short,

150
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,500
<4-1,Amy>结果我的子宫颈异常地紧
<4-1,Amy>turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.

151
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,870
<4-2,Penny>我说艾米啊  我们说要谈女生话题的时候
<4-2,Penny>You know -- Amy, when we say "girl talk",

152
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,780
<4-2,Penny>不一定是要谈论我们的女性部位的
<4-2,Penny>it doesn't just have to be about our lady parts.

153
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,660
<4-3,Amy>真可惜  因为我有个很精彩的故事
<4-3,Amy>Shame. 'Cause I have a real zinger

154
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,580
<4-3,Amy>是关于我倾斜的子宫的
<4-3,Amy>about my tilted uterus.

155
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,790
<4-4,Bernadette>佩妮  你的指甲好漂亮
<4-4,Bernadette>Penny, your nails look great.

156
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,960
<4-5,Penny>谢谢  我是在阿罕布拉宫找到这地方的
<4-5,Penny>Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra.

157
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,430
<4-5,Penny>是在一个女士地下廉价商场里
<4-5,Penny>It's in a woman's basement.

158
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,830
<4-5,Penny>虽然我觉得那只是拉皮条的幌子
<4-5,Penny>I think it's a front for human trafficking,

159
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,700
<4-5,Penny>不过他们的手艺倒真是不错
<4-5,Penny>but they do a really good job.

160
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,730
<4-6,Amy>我的一个同事的毕业论文就写的是
<4-6,Amy>A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus

161
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,500
<4-6,Amy>消毒不当的美甲工具上滋生的霉菌
<4-6,Amy>that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements.

162
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,440
<4-6,Amy>别说这不是女生话题
<4-6,Amy>Well don't tell me that's not "girl talk".

163
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,380
<4-7,Penny>我们今晚去哪好呢
<4-7,Penny>So where should we go tonight?

164
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,580
<4-7,Penny>酒吧  俱乐部  还是去看电影呢
<4-7,Penny>A bar? A club? A movie?

165
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,210
<4-8,Bernadette>或者我们也可以待在这
<4-8,Bernadette>Or we could just stay here.

166
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,820
<4-9,Amy>没错  继续交流感情
<4-9,Amy>Yes, a continue to bond.

167
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,520
<4-9,Amy>我预感今晚过后
<4-9,Amy>I have a feeling that after tonight,

168
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,020
<4-9,Amy>你们其中一个将成为我一辈子的好友
<4-9,Amy>one of you will become my best friend forever.

169
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,060
<4-9,Amy>或是"死党"  要是你们喜欢的话
<4-9,Amy>Or "BFF," if you prefer.

170
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,420
<4-9,Amy>我不喜欢
<4-9,Amy>Which I don't.

171
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,730
<4-10,Penny>好吧  开了单身二号吧[纯应景]
<4-10,Penny>All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.

172
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,130
<4-11,Bernadette>我觉得我不应该再喝了
<4-11,Bernadette>Gee, I don't know if I should drink more.

173
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,330
<4-11,Bernadette>我还得开车回家呢  我现在的视力
<4-11,Bernadette>I have to drive home, and I've got enough trouble

174
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,070
<4-11,Bernadette>就已经看不清仪表盘了
<4-11,Bernadette>seeing over the dashboard as it is.

175
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,410
<4-12,Penny>没关系  你可以在我这睡
<4-12,Penny>That's okay. You can just sleep here.

176
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,740
<4-13,Amy>太棒了  睡衣派对
<4-13,Amy>Oh, good, a slumber party!

177
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,080
<4-13,Amy>我们可以变装  打耍人电话
<4-13,Amy>We'll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls,

178
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,050
<4-13,Amy>然后穿着蕾丝睡衣玩枕头大战
<4-13,Amy>and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!

179
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,580
<4-14,Penny>天啊  艾米
<4-14,Penny>Oh, gosh, Amy.

180
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,050
<4-14,Penny>我不确定这是你所想的那种睡衣派对
<4-14,Penny>I don't know if I would call this an actual slumber party.

181
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,590
<4-15,Amy>太让人失望了
<4-15,Amy>Well, that's disappointing.

182
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,190
<4-15,Amy>我一直都想被人邀请去睡衣派对的
<4-15,Amy>I've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.

183
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,690
<4-16,Bernadette>你从没参加过吗
<4-16,Bernadette>Oh, you never were?

184
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,190
<4-17,Penny>小的时候也没有吗
<4-17,Penny>Not even when you were a kid?

185
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,730
<4-18,Amy>有一次我做完切除扁桃体的手术以后
<4-18,Amy>Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out,

186
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,160
<4-18,Amy>跟一个越南女孩一起住在病房里
<4-18,Amy>and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl.

187
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,970
<4-18,Amy>结果她半夜就死了
<4-18,Amy>She didn't make it through the night,

188
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,170
<4-18,Amy>但是在那之前  都还挺好玩的
<4-18,Amy>but up till then, it was kind of fun.

189
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,710
<4-19,Penny>好吧  那我们就搞个睡衣派对吧
<4-19,Penny>Okay. Well, I guess we're having a slumber party.

190
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,740
<4-20,Amy>枕头大战
<4-20,Amy>Pillow fight!

191
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,320
<5-1,Leonard>希望他们能早点放我们进去
<5-1,Leonard>Oh, I hope they let us in soon.

192
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,850
<5-1,Leonard>我不想总是跑到加油站去上厕所了
<5-1,Leonard>I'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom.

193
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,020
<5-1,Leonard>加油站那家伙每次都逼我买佳得乐
<5-1,Leonard>The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time.

194
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,460
<5-1,Leonard>简直是恶性循环
<5-1,Leonard>It's a vicious circle.

195
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,460
<5-2,Howard>可惜你没有排队伴侣
<5-2,Howard>Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.

196
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,830
<5-3,Leonard>什么是排队伴侣
<5-3,Leonard>What's a stadium pal?

197
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,460
<5-4,Howard>这么说吧
<5-4,Howard>Let me put it this way:

198
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,270
<5-4,Howard>它能解决厕所问题
<5-4,Howard>takes care of the bathroom problem,

199
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,800
<5-4,Howard>还能给你的小腿保暖
<5-4,Howard>and it keeps your calf warm.

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,340
<5-5,Raj>伙计们  坏消息  我刚刚算了一下
<5-5,Raj>Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation.

201
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,810
<5-5,Raj>根据电影院的大小和队伍的长度
<5-5,Raj>Given the size of the theater and the length of this line,

202
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,510
<5-5,Raj>我们可能没座位了
<5-5,Raj>we might not get seats.

203
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,810
<5-6,Sheldon>他说什么
<5-6,Sheldon>What did he say?

204
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,050
<5-7,Leonard>干得好  拉杰
<5-7,Leonard>Nice going, Raj.

205
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,850
<5-7,Leonard>好不容易让他睡觉的
<5-7,Leonard>Just got him down for his nap.

206
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,320
<5-8,Sheldon>我们有可能买不到票
<5-8,Sheldon>We might not get seats?!

207
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,990
<5-9,Leonard>肯定有的  放心  继续睡觉吧
<5-9,Leonard>It's fine, it's fine.Go back to sleep.

208
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,420
<5-10,Sheldon>我早知会过你们了  我早知会过你们了
<5-10,Sheldon>Oh, I informed you thusly! I so informed you thusly.

209
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,130
<5-11,Leonard>霍华德  你来安抚他吧
<5-11,Leonard>Howard, you talk to him.

210
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,430
<5-11,Leonard>霍华德
<5-11,Leonard>Howard?

211
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,270
<5-11,Leonard>你在尿尿  对吧
<5-11,Leonard>You're peeing, aren't you?

212
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,440
<5-12,Wil Wheaton>瞧瞧谁来了
<5-12,Wil Wheaton>Hey, look who's here!

213
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,170
<5-12,Wil Wheaton>你们好啊  伙计们
<5-12,Wil Wheaton>Hey, buddies!

214
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,770
<5-13,Sheldon>这不是《星际迷航》里的
<5-13,Sheldon>Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton,

215
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,810
<5-13,Sheldon>加·加·宾克斯——威尔·惠顿吗
<5-13,Sheldon>the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.

216
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,450
<5-14,Wil>偶们觉得你形容得真有意思[模仿加·加·宾克斯说话]
<5-14,Wil>Mee-sa think that very funny!

217
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,320
<5-15,Sheldon>你偶等可以排到最后面  慢慢回味
<5-15,Sheldon>Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line.

218
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,690
<5-15,Sheldon>不能插队  没有但是  没有椰汁
<5-15,Sheldon>No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

219
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,360
<5-16,Theatre Staff>威尔·惠顿
<5-16,Theatre Staff>Wil Wheaton.

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
<5-18,Theatre Staff>我可是你的忠实粉丝
<5-18,Theatre Staff>I'm a big fan.

222
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,660
<5-19,Sheldon>粉什么  那把修整不齐的络腮胡吗
<5-19,Sheldon>Of what? Poorly executed beards?

223
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
<5-20,Wil>你有办法能让我和我的朋友进去看电影吗
<5-20,Wil>Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie?

224
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,930
<5-20,Wil>因为我们来得有点晚了
<5-20,Wil>We got here a little late.

225
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,730
<5-21,Theatre Staff>没问题  跟我来  我带你们进去
<5-21,Theatre Staff>No problem. Come on, I'll hook you up.

226

<5-22,Wil>太棒了
<5-22,Wil>Awesome.

227

<5-22,Wil>偶们要进去看电影了  拜拜
<5-22,Wil>We-sa gonna go into the movie now! Bye-bye!

228
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,510
<5-23,Sheldon>现在放的是《夺宝奇兵》
<5-23,Sheldon>This is Indiana Jones,

229
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,410
<5-23,Sheldon>不是《星际迷航》
<5-23,Sheldon>not Star Trek.

230
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,350
<5-23,Sheldon>像这种伪名人根本不值得为他开后门
<5-23,Sheldon>There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here!

231
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,020
<5-23,Sheldon>即使是在《星际迷航》里
<5-23,Sheldon>And even at Star Trek conventions,

232
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,950
<5-23,Sheldon>如果他是来帮忙的  才放他进去呢

<10-3,Amy>It would have been hidden in sock drawers

335
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,550

<10-3,Amy>if people in the 14th century had worn socks.

340
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,190
<10-5,Amy>提示  要是很注意卫生的人

353
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,890
<10-12,Amy>你临时更改选择的
<10-12,Amy>for an ex post facto option change.

354
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,490
<10-13,Bernadette>是啊
<10-13,Bernadette>Yeah.

355
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,190
<10-14,Penny>我们只是不再是男女朋友
<10-14,Penny>Okay, look, just because we're not seeing each other anymore

356
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,930
<10-14,Penny>并不意味着不再是朋友
<10-14,Penny>doesn't meanwe can't be friends.

357
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,830
<10-14,Penny>毕竟莱纳德是个好人
<10-14,Penny>I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

358
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,930
<10-15,Amy>那你为什么要跟他分手
<10-15,Amy>Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?

359
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,330
<10-15,Amy>我不知道
<10-15,Amy>I don't know.

360
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,200
<10-16,Penny>他太认真了  而我还没准备好
<10-16,Penny>He got really serious, and I wasn't ready for it.

361
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,610
<10-17,Amy>有意思
<10-17,Amy>Interesting.

362
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,240
<10-17,Amy>那如果以后
<10-17,Amy>How will you react if, in the future,

363
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,380
<10-17,Amy>你准备好了  而莱纳德已另结新欢
<10-17,Amy>you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable,

364
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,480
<10-17,Amy>因为另外有个女人意识到
<10-17,Amy>because another woman has realized that he is--

365
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,650
<10-17,Amy>用你的话说"他是个好人"  那你怎么办
<10-17,Amy>to use your words--"a great guy"?

366
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,950
<10-18,Penny>你只能问一个问题
<10-18,Penny>You can only ask one question.

367
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,250
<10-19,Amy and Bernadette together>那问后面一个
<10-19,Amy and Bernadette together>That one.

368
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,890
<10-20,Penny>我不想玩这个游戏了
<10-20,Penny>You know what,  I don't want to play anymore.

369
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,700
<10-21,Amy>不知道这游戏怎么算得分
<10-21,Amy>Well, I'm not sure how this is scored,

370
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,100
<10-21,Amy>但相信我们俩赢了这局
<10-21,Amy>but I believe we may have won.

371
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,740
<11-1,Leonard>谢尔顿

373
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,810
<11-2,Howard>你去哪了
<11-2,Howard>Where did he go?

374
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,820
<11-2,Howard>我们在找谢尔顿  不是马默杜克[大丹麦狗]
<11-2,Howard>We're looking for Sheldon,not Marmaduke.

375
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,060
<11-3,Sheldon>你刚吹口哨了?
<11-3,Sheldon>You whistled?

376
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,390
<11-4,Leonard>这是什么
<11-4,Leonard>What is that?

377
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,930
<11-4,Leonard>《法柜奇兵》的胶片
<11-4,Leonard>Raiders of the Lost Ark

378
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,730
<11-5,Sheldon>带那加长的21秒的
<11-5,Sheldon>with 21 additional seconds.

379
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,000
<11-5,Sheldon>我看不到  别人也休想看到
<11-5,Sheldon>If I can't see it, no one else can see it.

380
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,870
<11-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  你疯了
<11-6,Leonard>Sheldon, this is crazy.

381
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,570
<11-7,Sheldon>不  放映室没人看管那才叫疯了
<11-7,Sheldon>No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.

382
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,070
<11-8,Leonard>听我说
<11-8,Leonard>Listen to me.

383
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,440
<11-8,Leonard>你累过头了  没法正确思考
<11-8,Leonard>You are over-tired. You're not thinking right.

384
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,880
<11-8,Leonard>趁麻烦还没惹大  赶紧放回去
<11-8,Leonard>Put the movie back before we get into trouble.

385
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,940
<11-9,Sheldon>麻烦就是我的中间名  莱纳德
<11-9,Sheldon>Trouble is my middle name,Leonard.

386
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,710
<11-9,Sheldon>其实是李  但我喜欢用"麻烦"
<11-9,Sheldon>Actually, it's Lee,but I prefer Trouble.

387
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,180
<11-10,Wil Wheaton>看看他们放谁进来了
<11-10,Wil Wheaton>Oh, look who they let in.

<12-3,Howard>你腿上绑个尿袋跑跑试试
<12-3,Howard>Let's see you run with a bag of urines trapped to your leg.

394
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,110
<12-3,Howard>（模仿电影《斑点》里的场景

<13-1,Bernadette>She's been in there a long time.

398
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,970
<13-2,Amy>明显  真心话大冒险玩输了她很伤心
<13-2,Amy>Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her.

399
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,940
<13-2,Amy>也许我们该转移下她的注意力
<13-2,Amy>Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it

400
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,910
<13-2,Amy>找个其他流行的睡衣派对游戏玩
