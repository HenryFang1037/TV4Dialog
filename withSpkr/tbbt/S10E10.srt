1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,620
<1-1,Amy>如果我们要继续住在这里
<1-1,Amy>If we're going to be staying in this apartment,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,350
<1-1,Amy>你有没有兴趣把这里重新装修一下呢
<1-1,Amy>would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,640
<1-2,Sheldon>其实呢  我还真愿意
<1-2,Sheldon>Oh, actually, I would.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,510
<1-3,Amy>太好了  你有什么想法吗
<1-3,Amy>Great, what'd you have in mind?

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,660
<1-4,Sheldon>把对面公寓的每一件东西都搬过来
<1-4,Sheldon>Let's take every single thing from the other apartment

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,930
<1-4,Sheldon>然后放在这里面
<1-4,Sheldon>and put it in here.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,210
<1-5,Amy>我们从小处开始着手如何
<1-5,Amy>Well, how about we start a little smaller?

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,400
<1-5,Amy>比如换下家具位置
<1-5,Amy>Like moving the furniture around.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,980
<1-6,Sheldon>其实我一直认为
<1-6,Sheldon>You know, I have always thought

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,780
<1-6,Sheldon>这张沙发如果放在
<1-6,Sheldon>that this couch would look fantastic

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,740
<1-6,Sheldon>公寓口垃圾堆  一定棒呆了
<1-6,Sheldon>on the curb in front of the building.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,980
<1-7,Amy>我们不能就这样把佩妮的东西扔掉
<1-7,Amy>Look, we can't just throw away Penny's stuff,

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,210
<1-7,Amy>但我们可以问她想不想把什么东西拿过去
<1-7,Amy>but we can ask if she wants any of it back.

14
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,330
<1-8,Sheldon>我想知道她会不会想要回这些挂画
<1-8,Sheldon>You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,260
<1-9,Amy>我确定她会很想念这张画
<1-9,Amy>Well, I'm sure she misses this one.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,500
<1-9,Amy>这可是我此生送给别人最棒的礼物了
<1-9,Amy>I mean, it's the greatest gift I've ever given anybody.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,540
<1-10,Sheldon>这画的确捕捉到了你与佩妮友情的美好
<1-10,Sheldon>It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,760
<1-11,Amy>而且这画可能还涨价了呢
<1-11,Amy>It may have appreciated in value.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,540
<1-11,Amy>画完这画之后  那个画家就自杀了呢
<1-11,Amy>The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,670
<1-12,Sheldon>这画不让她拿回去太说不过去了
<1-12,Sheldon>Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,110
<1-13,Amy>我都等不及看到她
<1-13,Amy>I can't wait to see the look on her face

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,100
<1-13,Amy>再度收到这画时的表情了
<1-13,Amy>when I give it to her again.

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,220
<2-1,Sheldon>你看  跟画上一模一样的笑容呢
<2-1,Sheldon>Look, it's the same smile she has in the painting.

33
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,690
<2-1,Sheldon>衣柜里有挂钩
<2-1,Sheldon>Yeah-- there's hooks in the closet,

34
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,870
<3-1,Sheldon>我现在就能帮你挂起来
<3-1,Sheldon>I can hang it right now.

35
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,790
<3-2,Penny>不用了  那些挂钩都不在了
<3-2,Penny>Oh, no, no, Th-those hooks are gone.

36
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,020
<3-3,Sheldon>怎么就不在了
<3-3,Sheldon>What happened to them?

37
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,060
<3-4,Penny>万圣节家里没糖果了
<3-4,Penny>Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween,

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,750
<3-4,Penny>我就把各种东西拿来送了
<3-4,Penny>I was just giving everything away.

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,260
<3-5,Leonard>你们俩怎么来...
<3-5,Leonard>Hey, guys, what are you...?

40
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,600
<3-5,Leonard>送这玩意儿来了  棒
<3-5,Leonard>Oh, that's here, cool.

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,840
<3-6,Penny>艾米想要我留着
<3-6,Penny>Amy wants me to have it.

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,770
<3-7,Amy>如果我自己留着  那就太自私了
<3-7,Amy>Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.

43
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,770
<3-8,Penny>但这画里有你
<3-8,Penny>B-But it's a picture of you.

44
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,640
<3-9,Amy>也有你
<3-9,Amy>And you.

45
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,680
<3-10,Penny>但是你请人画的
<3-10,Penny>But you commissioned it.

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,030
<3-11,Amy>画来送你
<3-11,Amy>To give to you.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,070
<3-12,Penny>但你这么爱它
<3-12,Penny>But you like it so much.

48
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,320
<3-13,Amy>你也爱它啊
<3-13,Amy>So do you.

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,790
<3-14,Penny>我节节败退啊
<3-14,Penny>I seem to be losing.

50
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,440
<3-15,Leonard>没错  的确是
<3-15,Leonard>Yes, you do.

51
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,190
<3-16,Sheldon>莱纳德  我仔细想想之后想到
<3-16,Sheldon>You know, Leonard, the more I think about it,

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,860
<3-16,Sheldon>这公寓里有好多我们共同拥有的东西啊
<3-16,Sheldon>there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment

53
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,330
<3-16,Sheldon>我们应该来过一遍所有权
<3-16,Sheldon>that you and I should go through.

54
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,020
<3-16,Sheldon>比如说
<3-16,Sheldon>Uh, for example...

55
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,970
<3-16,Sheldon>这把我们珍爱的《冰与火之歌》长爪宝剑
<3-16,Sheldon>who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?

56
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,970
<3-17,Penny>要不你拿去吧
<3-17,Penny>Why don't you keep it?

57
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,730
<3-18,Sheldon>这挺合理  毕竟我们刚把画让给你们了
<3-18,Sheldon>That seems fair; we did just give you the painting.

58
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,830
<3-19,Penny>家里不用留任何能让我切腹自尽的物品
<3-19,Penny>Yeah, I don't need anything around that I can stab myself with.

59
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,280
<3-20,Sheldon>太好了  长爪剑是我的啦
<3-20,Sheldon>Wonderful, Longclaw is mine.

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,070
<3-20,Sheldon>那要不你留下我们的...
<3-20,Sheldon>And how about you keep our...

61
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,250
<3-20,Sheldon>牛油果盆栽
<3-20,Sheldon>avocado plant?

62
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,080
<3-21,Leonard>很合理啊  一把价值几百美元的
<3-21,Leonard>Sounds right-- a limited edition collectible

63
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,690
<3-21,Leonard>限量版收藏品
<3-21,Leonard>worth hundreds of dollars

64
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,950
<3-21,Leonard>换从垃圾堆里捡来的破烂长出的所得物
<3-21,Leonard>and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.

65
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,680
<3-22,Sheldon>不过...  我跟艾米刚搬入新窝
<3-22,Sheldon>Although, Amy and I did just move in together,

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,510
<3-22,Sheldon>一盆植物是很好的新居礼物呢
<3-22,Sheldon>and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.

67
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,330
<3-23,Leonard>行  你把植物也拿走吧
<3-23,Leonard>Fine, take the plant.

68
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,830
<3-24,Sheldon>我们有剑又有植物
<3-24,Sheldon>Oh, we got a sword and a plant;

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,130
<3-24,Sheldon>咱们的小窝渐渐成型啦
<3-24,Sheldon>our apartment's really shaping up.

70
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,430
<4-1,Bernadette>斯图尔特  你不用送我们怀孕礼物啦
<4-1,Bernadette>Stuart, you didn't have to get us a baby gift.

71
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,570
<4-2,Stuart>就只是一些自制的兑换劵  上面有一些
<4-2,Stuart>Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with

72
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,270
<4-2,Stuart>宝宝生下来前你可能需要帮忙的事
<4-2,Stuart>before the baby gets here.

73
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,020
<4-2,Stuart>帮忙去超市买菜  开车载你去看医生
<4-2,Stuart>Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor.

74
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,340
<4-2,Stuart>如果不着急  我可以帮忙你挖个锦鲤池
<4-2,Stuart>If you're not in a hurry, I can dig you a koi pond.

75
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,120
<4-3,Bernadette>还有脚底按摩吗
<4-3,Bernadette>A foot massage?

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,790
<4-4,Stuart>这不是我在耍变态  你们俩谁用都行
<4-4,Stuart>And that's not me being creepy, that's for either of you.

77
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,980
<4-5,Howard>你人真好  谢谢你  斯图尔特
<4-5,Howard>This is very nice, Stuart, thank you.

78
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,950
<4-6,Bernadette>为什么兑换劵是写在一张驱逐令的后面
<4-6,Bernadette>How come this one's on the back of an eviction notice?

79
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,530
<4-7,Stuart>是啊  既然你刚好提到这事情...
<4-7,Stuart>Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it...

80
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,870
<4-7,Stuart>我能住在这里吗
<4-7,Stuart>can I live here?

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,750
<4-8,Bernadette>斯图尔特  我们很乐意帮忙你
<4-8,Bernadette>Stuart, we'd love to help you out,

82
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,780
<4-8,Bernadette>但现在真的不合适  我们马上要有孩子了
<4-8,Bernadette>but this a bad time; we're about to have a baby.

83
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,520
<4-9,Stuart>但也正因为如此  所以是好时候啊
<4-9,Stuart>Or is that why this is a great time?

84
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
<4-9,Stuart>你们想想  孩子生下来以后
<4-9,Stuart>Think about it-- when that baby comes,

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,660
<4-9,Stuart>你们会非常需要人手帮忙
<4-9,Stuart>you're gonna need all the help you can get.

86
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,640
<4-9,Stuart>谢谢
<4-9,Stuart>Thank you,

87
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,160
<4-10,Bernadette>但还是别了吧...
<4-10,Bernadette>but I'm not really sure.

88
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,630
<4-11,Howard>等等  或许这主意也不是那么糟
<4-11,Howard>Hang on, maybe it's not the worst idea.

89
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,620
<4-11,Howard>毕竟他当时照顾我妈的时候也做得很好啊
<4-11,Howard>I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.

90
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,270
<4-12,Stuart>打从由我负责撒爽身粉
<4-12,Stuart>That woman didn't get heat rash once

91
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,780
<4-12,Stuart>她再也没长过疹子
<4-12,Stuart>with me on powder patrol.

92
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,470
<4-13,Bernadette>那要不先让你住几天
<4-13,Bernadette>I guess you could stay for a few days

93
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,770
<4-13,Bernadette>我们看看再说吧
<4-13,Bernadette>and we'll see how it goes.

94
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,240
<4-13,Bernadette>谢谢
<4-13,Bernadette>Thank you.

95
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
<4-14,Stuart>只是暂时借住而已
<4-14,Stuart>And it's only temporary,

96
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,710
<4-14,Stuart>待我站稳脚跟  东山再起
<4-14,Stuart>just till I get back on my feet.

97
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,130
<4-14,Stuart>或是宝宝要去上大学了
<4-14,Stuart>or the baby goes off to college,

98
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,230
<4-14,Stuart>看哪件事先发生吧
<4-14,Stuart>whichever happens first.

99
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,980
<4-15,Howard>你什么时候搬进来
<4-15,Howard>When would you move in?

100
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,490
<4-16,Stuart>我的车在你们车道抛锚了
<4-16,Stuart>Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway,

101
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,170
<4-16,Stuart>大概是现在搬进来吧
<4-16,Stuart>so I'm gonna say now.

102
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,690
<4-16,Stuart>但我已经准备帮忙了
<4-16,Stuart>But I am ready to be helpful.

103
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,410
<4-16,Stuart>其实
<4-16,Stuart>In fact...

104
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,530
<4-16,Stuart>我现在就去吸地板
<4-16,Stuart>I'm gonna go vacuum.

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,360
<4-17,Bernadette>我今早才吸过一遍
<4-17,Bernadette>Actually I just did that this morning.

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,570
<4-17,Bernadette>好吧
<4-17,Bernadette>Okay.

107
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,840
<4-18,Stuart>那我去扫灰
<4-18,Stuart>Then I'll dust.

108
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,800
<4-19,Bernadette>我也做完了
<4-19,Bernadette>I did that, too.

109
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,800
<4-20,Stuart>那我去检查烟雾侦测器里的电池
<4-20,Stuart>Then I'll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.

110
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,530
<4-21,Bernadette>霍华德刚检查完
<4-21,Bernadette>Howard just did that.

111
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,870
<4-22,Howard>没事  让他做吧
<4-22,Howard>Yeah, let him do it.

112
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,510
<5-1,Sheldon>还记得我们从漫展买到这个吗
<5-1,Sheldon>Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?

113
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,760
<5-2,Leonard>当然
<5-2,Leonard>Oh, yeah.

114
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,390
<5-2,Leonard>斯波克报时钟
<5-2,Leonard>The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.

115
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,130
<5-3,Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock>生生不息繁荣昌盛  生生不息繁荣昌盛
<5-3,Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock>Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.

116
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,900
<5-3,Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock>生生不息繁荣昌盛
<5-3,Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock>Live long and prosper.

117
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
<5-3,Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock>生生不息繁荣昌盛
<5-3,Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock>Live long and prosper.

118
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,380
<5-4,Sheldon>世界上仅此一座
<5-4,Sheldon>It's one of a kind.

119
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,830
<5-5,Penny>所以如果坏了  世界上就没了吗
<5-5,Penny>So if it breaks there'd be none of it?

120
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,810
<5-6,Sheldon>莱纳德
<5-6,Sheldon>Well, Leonard,

121
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,500
<5-6,Sheldon>这个该归谁呢
<5-6,Sheldon>you know, who should keep this?

122
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,840
<5-6,Sheldon>一方面  我比你更爱斯波克先生
<5-6,Sheldon>On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do.

123
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,730
<5-6,Sheldon>另一方面  我比你更喜欢钟表
<5-6,Sheldon>On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.

124
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,230
<5-7,Leonard>所以你觉得这个该归你吗
<5-7,Leonard>So you think you should keep it?

125
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,490
<5-8,Sheldon>我就住在对面
<5-8,Sheldon>I'll be right across the hall.

126
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,060
<5-8,Sheldon>你没准还能听到它报时呢
<5-8,Sheldon>You'll probably be able to hear it.

127
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,340
<5-9,Leonard>你拿走吧  谢尔顿
<5-9,Leonard>Keep the clock, Sheldon.

128
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,260
<5-10,Sheldon>谢谢你
<5-10,Sheldon>Thank you.

129
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,120
<5-10,Sheldon>-是谢谢你  -谢他干嘛
<5-10,Sheldon>- Thank you. - Thank you?

130
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,460
<5-12,Amy>现在
<5-12,Amy>Oh, now...

131
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,770
<5-13,Sheldon>这三维象棋该归谁
<5-13,Sheldon>what about our 3-D chess set?

132
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,930
<5-14,Leonard>我猜猜  你想要
<5-14,Leonard>Let me guess, you want it.

133
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,990
<5-15,Sheldon>没有啦
<5-15,Sheldon>Well, no,

134
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,000
<5-15,Sheldon>我只是觉得你不会想有东西时刻提醒你
<5-15,Sheldon>I just didn't think you'd want a physical reminder

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,220
<5-15,Sheldon>这一款游戏你这辈子都赢不了
<5-15,Sheldon>of a game you never managed to win.

136
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,770
<5-15,Sheldon>出于好心  我该把所有游戏都拿走
<5-15,Sheldon>As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.

137
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,480
<5-16,Leonard>好呀  谢尔顿  你拿走吧
<5-16,Leonard>You know what, Sheldon, take it.

138
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,890
<5-16,Leonard>其实你可以把所有东西都拿走
<5-16,Leonard>In fact, you can have everything.

139
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,780
<5-16,Leonard>我真的不在乎
<5-16,Leonard>I really don't care.

140
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,290
<5-16,Leonard>你确定吗
<5-16,Leonard>Are you sure?

141
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,820
<5-17,Sheldon>这些东西代表着我们曾经共度的时光
<5-17,Sheldon>These items represent our shared times together.

142
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,330
<5-18,Leonard>-现在都归你了  -莱纳德
<5-18,Leonard>- Well, now they're yours. - Leonard....

143
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,610
<5-20,Leonard>你也知道接下来会怎么样
<5-20,Leonard>Well, you know what's gonna happen.

144
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,020
<5-20,Leonard>他会编个理由来说明
<5-20,Leonard>He's just gonna come up with some reason

145
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,820
<5-20,Leonard>为什么一切都该归他
<5-20,Leonard>why everything should be his.

146
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,590
<5-21,Sheldon>你既然这么会预测我的举动
<5-21,Sheldon>For a man so good at predicting my moves,

147
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,210
<5-21,Sheldon>三维象棋怎么就下得这么烂呢
<5-21,Sheldon>how come you stink at 3-D chess?

148
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,410
<5-22,Amy>谢尔顿  你这样有点自私吧
<5-22,Amy>Sheldon, you're-you're being a little selfish.

149
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,800
<5-22,Amy>你干嘛不让莱纳德挑几样东西留下来
<5-22,Amy>Why don't you let Leonard keep a few things?

150
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
<5-23,Sheldon>我不善于分享又不是我的错
<5-23,Sheldon>It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing;

151
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,540
<5-23,Sheldon>谁让我没上过幼儿园呢
<5-23,Sheldon>I skipped kindergarten.

152
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,400
<5-24,Leonard>知道吗
<5-24,Leonard>You know what?

153
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,820
<5-24,Leonard>有一样东西我的确想留下来
<5-24,Leonard>There is one thing I would like.

154
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,130
<5-25,Sheldon>好啊  想要什么随便拿
<5-25,Sheldon>Yeah, take whatever you want.

155
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,290
<5-26,Leonard>我想要留下...
<5-26,Leonard>I would like to keep...

156
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,990
<5-26,Leonard>我们公寓的官方旗帜
<5-26,Leonard>the official flag of our apartment.

157
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,120
<5-27,Sheldon>可你压根不喜欢旗帜啊
<5-27,Sheldon>But you don't even like flags.

158
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,340
<5-28,Leonard>我独爱这一面
<5-28,Leonard>Yeah, I like this one.

159
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,140
<5-29,Sheldon>但这是我设计的
<5-29,Sheldon>But I designed it.

160
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,610
<5-30,Leonard>但是我订购回来的  因为你在旗帜圈里"太有名"
<5-30,Leonard>But you made me order it because you were "Too well-known"

161
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,900
<5-30,Leonard>所以人们知道是你  就肯定会提价
<5-30,Leonard>in the flag community and they'd jack up the price.

162
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,500
<5-31,Sheldon>但你根本不懂这旗帜的象征意义
<5-31,Sheldon>But you don't even understand its symbolism.

163
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,360
<5-32,Leonard>我懂啊
<5-32,Leonard>Oh, I do.

164
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
<5-32,Leonard>蓝色的部分代表着你现在痛苦不堪
<5-32,Leonard>The-the field of blue represents you being miserable,

165
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,270
<5-32,Leonard>吐舌头的狮子意味着
<5-32,Leonard>and the lion sticking its tongue out means

166
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,540
<5-32,Leonard>我喜见乐闻
<5-32,Leonard>I'm happy about it.

167
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,250
<5-33,Sheldon>走吧  艾米
<5-33,Sheldon>Come along, Amy.

168
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,200
<5-33,Sheldon>别人想我滚时我能感觉到
<5-33,Sheldon>I know when I'm not wanted.

169
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,980
<5-34,Amy>我不认为你真知道  但好吧
<5-34,Amy>I don't think you do, but all right.

170
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,160
<6-1,Bernadette>斯图尔特  你做饭了吗
<6-1,Bernadette>Stuart, you cooked?

171
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,900
<6-2,Howard>你怎么知道不是我做的饭
<6-2,Howard>How did you know it wasn't me?

172
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,600
<6-3,Bernadette>家里虽然只有三个人
<6-3,Bernadette>There's only three people in this house,

173
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,580
<6-3,Bernadette>我猜肚子的宝宝和拉杰  都不会猜你
<6-3,Bernadette>and you'd still be my fifth guess.

174
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,270
<6-4,Howard (door bell rings)>拉杰来了
<6-4,Howard (door bell rings)>That's Raj.

175
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,310
<6-5,Stuart>你们坐
<6-5,Stuart>You guys relax,

176
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,770
<6-5,Stuart>我去开门
<6-5,Stuart>I'll get it.

177
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,540
<6-5,Stuart>面包快趁热吃点
<6-5,Stuart>Have some bread while it's still warm.

178
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,880
<6-6,Howard>感觉就像我们有个管家
<6-6,Howard>It's like we have a butler.

179
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,990
<6-6,Howard>如果我有变蝙蝠衣  那我就是公子哥蝙蝠侠啦
<6-6,Howard>If I had a Batsuit I'd be Bruce Wayne.

180
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,330
<6-7,Bernadette>你有蝙蝠衣啊
<6-7,Bernadette>You have a Batsuit.

181
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,580
<6-8,Howard>那是睡衣  没有斗篷
<6-8,Howard>It's pajamas, there's no cape.

182
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,330
<6-9,Stuart>拉杰
<6-9,Stuart>Hey, Raj.

183
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,210
<6-10,Raj>斯图尔特  你在这里干什么
<6-10,Raj>Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?

184
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,800
<6-11,Stuart>我又住在这里啦
<6-11,Stuart>Oh, I'm living here again.

185
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,600
<6-12,Raj>霍华德和伯纳黛特知道这事吗
<6-12,Raj>Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know?

186
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,950
<6-12,Raj>还是像负鼠那样  住在墙壁里在夹缝中生存
<6-12,Raj>Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?

187
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,680
<6-13,Stuart>不  我需要个地方住
<6-13,Stuart>No, I needed a place to stay

188
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,740
<6-13,Stuart>而且宝宝快出生了
<6-13,Stuart>and, with the baby coming,

189
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,620
<6-13,Stuart>我觉得他们需要多个人手来帮忙
<6-13,Stuart>I figured they could use some extra help.

190
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,600
<6-14,Raj>行吧
<6-14,Raj>Okay, cool.

191
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
<6-15,Stuart>进来吧  晚餐做好了
<6-15,Stuart>Anyway, come on in, dinner's ready.

192
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,050
<6-16,Raj>可我买了中餐外卖
<6-16,Raj>Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.

193
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,970
<6-16,Raj>好吧
<6-16,Raj>Oh, okay.

194
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,190
<6-17,Stuart>如果伯纳黛特希望她的脚踝更水肿
<6-17,Stuart>Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more,

195
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,960
<6-17,Stuart>她可以吃你买的啊
<6-17,Stuart>she can have that.

196
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,210
<7-1,Leonard>你那无线网能用吗
<7-1,Leonard>Is the Wi-Fi working for you?

197
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,760
<7-2,Penny>稍等
<7-2,Penny>Uh, hang on.

198
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,320
<7-2,Penny>不能用  我点击了
<7-2,Penny>I don't think so, I'm clicking on

199
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,930
<7-2,Penny>"让小腹变平坦的小怪招"
<7-2,Penny>"One weird trick for a flat belly,"

200
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,730
<7-2,Penny>可我还停留在
<7-2,Penny>but I'm still seeing

201
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,780
<7-2,Penny>"长得像自家宠物的名人们"的页面
<7-2,Penny>"Celebrities who look like their pets."

202
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,200
<7-3,Leonard>我知道了
<7-3,Leonard>Oh, I knew it,

203
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
<7-3,Leonard>谢尔顿改了无线密码
<7-3,Leonard>Sheldon changed the password.

204
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,590
<7-4,Penny>真的假的
<7-4,Penny>Are you sure?

205
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,510
<7-5,Leonard>现在的无线网名称是
<7-5,Leonard>Well, the new network name is,

206
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,320
<7-5,Leonard>"哈哈  栽我手里了吧"  所以...
<7-5,Leonard>"Ha ha ha, now I've got you," so...

207
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,420
<7-5,Leonard>不是谢尔顿  就是蓝精灵的格格巫
<7-5,Leonard>It's either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.

208
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,060
<7-6,Penny>混蛋
<7-6,Penny>What a jerk.

209
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,560
<7-7,Leonard>你擅长报复  我们该怎么治治他
<7-7,Leonard>You're good at revenge; how do we get him back?

210
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,970
<7-8,Penny>我的必杀技通常是
<7-8,Penny>Well, my go-to move is usually

211
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,530
<7-8,Penny>睡那人的男朋友
<7-8,Penny>sleep with the person's boyfriend,

212
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,070
<7-8,Penny>但我有点觉得自己已经这样做了
<7-8,Penny>but I kind of feel like I'm already doing that.

213
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,030
<7-9,Leonard>谢尔顿  我知道你干了什么
<7-9,Leonard>Sheldon, I know what you did,

214
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,790
<7-9,Leonard>快把密码改回来
<7-9,Leonard>now change the password back.

215
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,950
<7-10,Sheldon>天下竟有这种奇事
<7-10,Sheldon>Well, powder me in sugar and call me a donut,

216
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,950
<7-10,Sheldon>莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德大驾光临
<7-10,Sheldon>if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.

217
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,500
<7-11,Leonard>谢尔顿  我警告你
<7-11,Leonard>Sheldon, I'm warning you,

218
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,290
<7-11,Leonard>你玩的小把戏的我也会玩
<7-11,Leonard>I can play this game, too.

219
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,190
<7-12,Sheldon>如果你玩小把戏和玩三维象棋的水准一样
<7-12,Sheldon>If it's like your 3-D chess game,

220
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,270
<7-12,Sheldon>那你可是在三个维度上都不自量力
<7-12,Sheldon>then you're out of your length, width and depth.

221
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,930
<7-12,Sheldon>艾米  拿药膏来
<7-12,Sheldon>Amy, get the Neosporin,

222
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,050
<7-12,Sheldon>有人被损得体无完肤啦
<7-12,Sheldon>somebody just got burned.

223
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,970
<7-13,Leonard>好吧  我尽力了
<7-13,Leonard>All right, I tried.

224
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,200
<7-13,Leonard>"好吧  我尽力了"
<7-13,Leonard>"All right, I tried."

225
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,290
<7-14,Sheldon>你应该用这句当你自传的书名
<7-14,Sheldon>That should be the title of your autobiography.

226
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,230
<7-14,Sheldon>有人被损得皮焦肉烂啦
<7-14,Sheldon>Ooh, a second-degree burn.

227
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,890
<7-15,Amy>我把药膏拿来了
<7-15,Amy>I've got the Neosporin.

228
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,430
<7-15,Amy>是谁受伤了
<7-15,Amy>Who got hurt?

229
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,250
<7-16,Sheldon>还好你的可爱可以弥补智商
<7-16,Sheldon>It's a good thing you're cute.

230
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,290
<8-1,Raj>我之前读到  准父母最好报班学习
<8-1,Raj>So, I was reading how it's a good idea for new parents

231
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,460
<8-1,Raj>婴儿心肺复苏术
<8-1,Raj>to take an infant CPR class.

232
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,930
<8-2,Bernadette>是啊  我们一直打算去
<8-2,Bernadette>Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.

233
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,700
<8-3,Stuart>我认识一个可以上门授课的心肺复苏指导员
<8-3,Stuart>Oh, I know a CPR instructor who'll come to the house.

234
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,640
<8-5,Stuart>-那就太好了  -那我给他打个电话
<8-5,Stuart>- That'd be great. - I'll give him a call.

235
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,340
<8-5,Stuart>我在沙滩上睡觉时遇见他
<8-5,Stuart>We met when I was sleeping on the beach

236
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,100
<8-5,Stuart>他当时以为我死了
<8-5,Stuart>and he thought I was dead.

237
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,950
<8-6,Bernadette>再次谢谢你做晚饭
<8-6,Bernadette>Thank you again for cooking.

238
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,340
<8-6,Bernadette>现在站一整天对我来说越来越辛苦了
<8-6,Bernadette>It's getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.

239
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,400
<8-7,Stuart>你尽管好好休息放松
<8-7,Stuart>You just kick back and relax;

240
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,470
<8-7,Stuart>一切都包在我身上
<8-7,Stuart>I've got it all under control.

241
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,840
<8-8,Raj>本来就有人承包这一切事宜了
<8-8,Raj>Although it was already under control.

242
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,350
<8-9,Stuart>不好意思  你嘟囔的啥我没听清
<8-9,Stuart>I'm sorry, you mumbled something?

243
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,760
<8-10,Raj>我只是说他们本来也有人帮忙
<8-10,Raj>It's just that they've had plenty of help.

244
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,990
<8-11,Stuart>俗语说得好
<8-11,Stuart>Well, you know what they say --

245
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,260
<8-11,Stuart>"举全村之力  养好一个娃"
<8-11,Stuart>it takes a village.

246
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,060
<8-12,Raj>他们早有全村人  用不着你
<8-12,Raj>Well, they already had a village.

247
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,160
<8-13,Stuart>我怎么没见全村人抽空把婴儿床装好呢
<8-13,Stuart>I noticed the village couldn't find time to put the crib together.

248
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,980
<8-14,Raj>没准全村人都忙着为新生儿调查
<8-14,Raj>Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out

249
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,270
<8-14,Raj>本地蒙特梭利早教中心的口碑好不好
<8-14,Raj>the local Montessori school for the new arrival.

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,460
<8-15,Stuart>你是说儿童沙坑里有空啤酒瓶的那家吗
<8-15,Stuart>You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox?

251
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,720
<8-15,Stuart>我们不去  劳您费心了
<8-15,Stuart>We'll pass, thank you.

252
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,120
<8-16,Bernadette>想想办法啊  蝙蝠侠
<8-16,Bernadette>Do something, Batman.

253
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,630
<9-2,Sheldon>你这是在干什么
<9-2,Sheldon>What do you think you're doing?

254
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,340
<9-3,Leonard>内衣裤要分开来洗啊
<9-3,Leonard>Separating my delicates.

255
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,720
<9-4,Sheldon>你竟堕落到如此地步
<9-4,Sheldon>This is the level you're stooping to.

256
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,600
<9-4,Sheldon>不
<9-4,Sheldon>No.

257
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,760
<9-4,Sheldon>这才是我要堕落到的地步
<9-4,Sheldon>This is the level I am stooping to.

258
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,860
<9-5,Leonard>公寓旗移至股间4格  将军
<9-5,Leonard>I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate.

<9-5,Leonard>轻松舒爽  胯下惠风和畅
<9-5,Leonard>Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.

260
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,560
<10-1,Stuart>有何贵干
<10-1,Stuart>Hey, what's up?

261
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,850
<10-2,Raj>我是来装婴儿床的
<10-2,Raj>I'm here to put the crib together.

262
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,080
<10-3,Stuart>不好意思  我已经装好了
<10-3,Stuart>Ooh, sorry, I already did it.

263
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,020
<10-4,Raj>我觉得你可能没意识到这点
<10-4,Raj>Oh, I don't know if you realize this,

264
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,660
<10-4,Raj>但那婴儿床是我买的
<10-4,Raj>but I bought that crib.

265
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,490
<10-5,Stuart>我在"谁特么鸟你网"上看到了
<10-5,Stuart>Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.Com

266
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,030
<10-6,Raj>你为什么要对我百般刁难
<10-6,Raj>Why are you being like this?

267
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,060
<10-7,Stuart>因为我关爱霍华德和伯纳黛特
<10-7,Stuart>Because I love Howard and Bernadette

268
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,440
<10-7,Stuart>如果我想死赖着不走  我得帮得上忙
<10-7,Stuart>and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.

269
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,730
<10-8,Raj>在你来之前  这个孕期早就被我
<10-8,Raj>Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy

270
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,570
<10-8,Raj>这个情感空虚的电灯泡承包了
<10-8,Raj>third wheel way before you came along.

271
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,740
<10-9,Stuart>谁规定电灯泡只能有一个
<10-9,Stuart>Why can't there be four wheels?

272
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,220
<10-10,Raj>我不在的时候  你就是这么争宠的吗
<10-10,Raj>Is this what you do when I'm not here,

273
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,670
<10-10,Raj>你个说话句句在理的狐媚子

<10-12,Raj>谢谢
<10-12,Raj>Thank you.

276

<10-13,Stuart>If you're hungry you can eat your takeout;

<10-13,Stuart>没人稀罕吃
<10-13,Stuart>nobody touched it.

278
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,190
<11-1,Penny>我想去跑步
<11-1,Penny>I think I'm gonna go for a run.

279
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,520
<11-1,Penny>你想一起来吗
<11-1,Penny>You want to come?

280

<11-2,Leonard>"妹子小心  那变态马上要追上你了"
<11-2,Leonard>"Watch out, he's right behind you."

<11-5,Strange old man>我没什么事  不过谢谢你好心询问
<11-5,Strange old man>I don't think so, but you're sweet for asking.

286
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,390
<11-6,Penny>你在我们公寓里做什么
<11-6,Penny>What-What are you doing in our apartment?

287
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,400
<11-7,Strange old man>你们邻居租了间房给我  瘦得像电线杆
<11-7,Strange old man>Oh, I rented a room from your neighbor, the tall guy...

288
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,080
<11-7,Strange old man>穿着像未成年小宅男那个
<11-7,Strange old man>dressed like a little boy.

289
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,190
<11-8,Leonard>难以置信
<11-8,Leonard>Unbelievable.

290
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,690
<11-8,Leonard>好吧  我不知道他是怎么跟您说的
<11-8,Leonard>Okay, uh, I don't know what he told you,

291
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,120
<11-8,Leonard>但您不能住在这
<11-8,Leonard>but you can't stay here.

292

<11-9,Sheldon>床单已经都换成新的了
<11-9,Sheldon>So, there are fresh linens on the bed and...

<11-9,Sheldon>看来你们已经见过西奥多了
<11-9,Sheldon>Well, now, I see you've met Theodore.

<11-9,Sheldon>他们为人忠厚
<11-9,Sheldon>They're very honest,

297
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,340
<11-9,Sheldon>但我建议你把现金都收好
<11-9,Sheldon>but I would not leave cash lying around.

298
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,150
<11-10,Leonard>谢尔顿  你这是在做些什么
<11-10,Leonard>Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?

<11-11,Sheldon>这个月的房租我已经付过了
<11-11,Sheldon>My room is paid up until the end of the month,

300
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,390
<11-11,Sheldon>所以我想怎么样就怎么样
<11-11,Sheldon>so I can do with it whatever I please,

301
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,330
<11-11,Sheldon>包括以一块钱一晚的价格租出去
<11-11,Sheldon>which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.

302
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,000
<11-12,Theodore>房价一夜回到解放前
<11-12,Theodore>It's like the '40s again.

303
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,290
<11-13,Sheldon>好了  我不打扰你们了
<11-13,Sheldon>Anyway, I'll leave you be.

304
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,490
<11-13,Sheldon>我还得去
<11-13,Sheldon>I have to...

305
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,780
<11-13,Sheldon>他希望早上能有报纸看
<11-13,Sheldon>He's expecting a newspaper in the morning.

306
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,550
<11-13,Sheldon>原来这年头还有人在印报纸呢
<11-13,Sheldon>Apparently, they still make them.

307
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,600
<11-14,Penny>谢尔顿  你这么做太过份了
<11-14,Penny>All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.

308
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
<11-15,Sheldon>没错
<11-15,Sheldon>That's true,

309
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,580
<11-15,Sheldon>但如果我不这么过份
<11-15,Sheldon>but had I done something under the line,

310
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,050
<11-15,Sheldon>你们厨房里就不会出现一个
<11-15,Sheldon>there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen

311
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,360
<11-15,Sheldon>身上什么身份证明都没有的陌生人了
<11-15,Sheldon>who can't produce a single form of ID.

312
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,590
<11-16,Theodore>我有张卖血的收据
<11-16,Theodore>Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank.

313
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,180
<11-16,Theodore>我是O型阴性血
<11-16,Theodore>I'm O-negative.

314
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,350
<11-17,Sheldon>现在你们对他的了解我和一样多了
<11-17,Sheldon>And now you know as much about him as I do.

315
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,690
<12-1,Raj>伯纳黛特
<12-1,Raj>Oh, hey, Bernadette,

316
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,790
<12-1,Raj>这个秋千送了两种转动玩具
<12-1,Raj>the swing comes with two different mobiles.

317
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,750
<12-1,Raj>这些长颈鹿挺可爱的  你觉得呢
<12-1,Raj>The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?

318
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,480
<12-2,Bernadette>挺好  就用长颈鹿吧
<12-2,Bernadette>Great, go with the giraffes.

319
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
<12-2,Bernadette>然而...
<12-2,Bernadette>Although...

320
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,140
<12-3,Stuart>斑马身上对比鲜明的条纹
<12-3,Stuart>the high contrast of zebra stripes

321
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,380
<12-3,Stuart>可能能更好地刺激宝宝发育
<12-3,Stuart>might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.

322
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,590
<12-4,Bernadette>说得有道理  还是选斑马吧
<12-4,Bernadette>Yeah, you're probably right, go with the zebras.

323
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,730
<12-5,Stuart>太有眼光了  大佬
<12-5,Stuart>Good choice, boss.

324
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,380
<12-5,Stuart>棕色鼻子  意为马屁精
<12-5,Stuart>跪舔菊花的时候鼻子沾到...

325
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,380
<12-6,Raj>至少我的鼻子不是因为拍马屁才变棕色的
<12-6,Raj>At least my nose is naturally brown.

326
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,770
<12-7,Bernadette>你能替我去趟超市吗
<12-7,Bernadette>Hey, could you please go to the market for me?

327
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,600
<12-8,Howard>让斯图尔特或拉杰去嘛
<12-8,Howard>Get Stuart or Raj to do it.

328
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,340
<12-9,Bernadette>华仔  他俩替你代劳了所有事
<12-9,Bernadette>Howie, they've been doing everything for you.

329
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,990
<12-10,Howard>我知道
<12-10,Howard>Mm, I know.

330
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,270
<12-10,Howard>让我越来越看不起这两个家伙了
<12-10,Howard>It's really making me lose respect for both of them.

331
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,080
<12-11,Bernadette>你就去一趟嘛
<12-11,Bernadette>Please just go to the store.

333
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,950
<12-12,Howard>有人要载我去买东西不
<12-12,Howard>Who wants to drive me to the store?

334

<12-14,Stuart (off)>-我去  -我去
<12-14,Stuart (off)>- Me! - I'll do it!

335
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,680
<12-15,Bernadette>让拉杰去
<12-15,Bernadette>Take Raj.

336
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
<12-15,Bernadette>斯图尔特要帮我涂脚指甲油
<12-15,Bernadette>Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.

337
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,710
<12-15,Bernadette>你怎么看
<12-15,Bernadette>What do you think?

338
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,180
<13-1,Penny>我们应该去住酒店吗
<13-1,Penny>Should we go to a hotel?

339
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,030
<13-2,Leonard>把他单独留在家里吗
<13-2,Leonard>And just leave him here alone?

340
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,340
<13-1,Penny>也对  那我自己住酒店
<13-1,Penny>Okay, I'll go to a hotel.

341
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,230
<13-3,Penny>如果明早你还没死  记得短信通知我
<13-3,Penny>Text me in the morning if you're still alive.

342
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,070
<13-4,Leonard>西奥多
<13-4,Leonard>Uh, Theodore,

343
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,490
<13-4,Leonard>你打算在这里住多久
<13-4,Leonard>how long are you planning to stay exactly?

344
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,230
<13-5,Theodore>多亏了我在你家沙发里找到的硬币
<13-5,Theodore>Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch,

345
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,640
<13-5,Theodore>比我想象中又多了一天
<13-5,Theodore>a day longer than I thought.

346
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,340
<13-6,Leonard>实在是太不像话了
<13-6,Leonard>This is ridiculous.

347
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,780
<13-7,Theodore>我好喜欢这幅画
<13-7,Theodore>I like the painting.

348
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,340
<13-7,Theodore>另一个人是你妈吗
<13-7,Theodore>Is that your mom?

349
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,190
<13-8,Leonard>谢尔顿  给我出来
<13-8,Leonard>Sheldon, get out here!

350
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,660
<13-9,Sheldon>你小声点好不好
<13-9,Sheldon>Will you keep it down?

351
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,330
<13-9,Sheldon>你当我这儿开得是
<13-9,Sheldon>What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast

352
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,040
<13-9,Sheldon>吵吵嚷嚷的黑旅店吗
<13-9,Sheldon>do you think I'm running?

353
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,650
<13-10,Leonard>我们一起生活了13年
<13-10,Leonard>We lived together 13 years.

354
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,480
<13-10,Leonard>你怎么能对我如此狠心
<13-10,Leonard>How can you be so awful to me?

355
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,740
<13-11,Sheldon>我狠心吗
<13-11,Sheldon>I'm being awful?!

356
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,780
<13-11,Sheldon>你才是在我心上用力开一枪的人
<13-11,Sheldon>You're the one who went out of your way to hurt me.

357
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,340
<13-12,Leonard>那是因为你太自私了
<13-12,Leonard>Because you were being selfish.

358
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,370
<13-13,Sheldon>和你分财产可是件难事呢
<13-13,Sheldon>Dividing our belongings is difficult.

359
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,390
<13-14,Leonard>有什么难的  我什么都不想要
<13-14,Leonard>Why? I said I didn't care!

360
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,100
<13-15,Theodore>打扰一下
<13-15,Theodore>Excuse me.

361
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,900
<13-15,Theodore>虽然不关我的事  不过听起来
<13-15,Theodore>It's none of my business, but it sounds like a lot

362
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,130
<13-15,Theodore>你们的怒气都是由爱而生的
<13-15,Theodore>of this anger is coming from love.

363
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,500
<13-16,Leonard>我谢谢你全家  没人要你说话
<13-16,Leonard>Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.

364
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,100
<13-17,Theodore>不管怎样我还是要说下去
<13-17,Theodore>Well, I'm just gonna keep on talking.

365
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,220
<13-17,Theodore>看起来  谢尔顿的搬走
<13-17,Theodore>Seems like, with Sheldon moving out,

366
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,440
<13-17,Theodore>让你的生活进入了一个新的阶段
<13-17,Theodore>you're in a new phase of your lives

367
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,020
<13-17,Theodore>所以你们选择了简单的大吵大闹
<13-17,Theodore>and it's easier to fight than to face the feelings

368
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,070
<13-17,Theodore>来掩饰你们对彼此的真感情
<13-17,Theodore>that you have for one another.

369
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,910
<13-18,Amy>我觉得他说得有道理
<13-18,Amy>I think he might be right.

370
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,920
<13-18,Amy>另外  这位高人是谁啊
<13-18,Amy>Also, who is that?

371
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,820
<13-19,Sheldon>我必须承认
<13-19,Sheldon>I have to admit,

372
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,570
<13-19,Sheldon>与你分开  和艾米同居
<13-19,Sheldon>leaving you to move in with Amy

373
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,120
<13-19,Sheldon>比我想象中要难得多
<13-19,Sheldon>has been harder than I thought it would be.

374
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,570
<13-20,Leonard>对我也一样
<13-20,Leonard>Well, for me, too.

375
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,230
<13-20,Leonard>你走了  一切都不同了
<13-20,Leonard>It's not the same with you gone.

376
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,020
<13-21,Theodore>如果你想找个新室友...
<13-21,Theodore>If you're looking for a new guy to live with...

377
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,170
<13-23,Penny>-没门  -不用了  谢谢
<13-23,Penny>-No! - We're good. Thank you.

378
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,900
<13-24,Amy>没人打算回答我吗  好吧
<13-24,Amy>So, no one's gonna tell me? Okay.

00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,860
<13-25,Sheldon>莱纳德  我希望能停止
<13-25,Sheldon>Leonard, I would like us to

380
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,270
<13-25,Sheldon>这场财产争夺之战
<13-25,Sheldon>stop fighting about our possessions.

381
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,670
<13-26,Leonard>举双手同意
<13-26,Leonard>Well, I'd like that, too.

382
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,010
<13-27,Sheldon>我希望你能保留我们的公寓旗
<13-27,Sheldon>In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag,

383
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,310
<13-27,Sheldon>我这么说并不仅仅是
<13-27,Sheldon>and I'm not just saying that

384
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,850
<13-27,Sheldon>因为你用生殖器磨蹭过它
<13-27,Sheldon>because it touched your genitals.

385
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,250
<13-28,Leonard>你说真的吗
<13-28,Leonard>You promise?

386
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,250
<13-28,Leonard>我保证
<13-28,Leonard>I do.

387
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,080
<13-29,Sheldon>为了表示我内心真的没有芥蒂
<13-29,Sheldon>And to show you that there are no hard feelings,

388
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,560
<13-29,Sheldon>我还愿意用我的生殖器磨蹭那旗子
<13-29,Sheldon>I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.

389
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,470
<13-29,Sheldon>哎哟喂
<13-29,Sheldon>Well...

390
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,520
<13-30,Theodore>说到用鸟磨蹭东西  这可是我的强项
<13-30,Theodore>if we're rubbing genitals on things, that's where I shine.

391
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,550
<14-1,Penny>左边往下点
<14-1,Penny>Little lower to the left.

392
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,880
<14-1,Penny>再往下点
<14-1,Penny>A little more.

393
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,130
<14-2,Leonard>好了吗
<14-2,Leonard>Is it good?

394
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,680
<14-3,Penny>没用  还是丑得犯罪
<14-3,Penny>No, still hideous.

395
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,460
<14-4,Leonard>我相信不久的将来
<14-4,Leonard>Well, I'm sure at some point,

396
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,220
<14-4,Leonard>我们就会完全忽略它的存在了
<14-4,Leonard>we won't even notice it's there.

397
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,050
<14-5,Penny>你想得挺美
<14-5,Penny>Yeah, you'd think that,

398
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,870
<14-5,Penny>但不久它就会出现在你的噩梦里
<14-5,Penny>but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.

399
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,720
<14-6,Theodore>我觉得它让整个房间熠熠生辉
<14-6,Theodore>I think it brings the room together.

405
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,240
<15-4,Raj>不等于你就是个艺术家
<15-4,Raj>doesn't make you an artist.

406
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,610
<15-5,Stuart>我一脸菜色也不等于我吃不饱饭啊
