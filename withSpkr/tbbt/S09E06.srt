1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,550
<1-1,Sheldon>莱纳德
<1-1,Sheldon>Leonard...

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,360
<1-1,Sheldon>我有个天大的坏消息
<1-1,Sheldon>I've got terrible news.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,800
<1-2,Leonard>怎么了
<1-2,Leonard>What's going on?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,390
<1-3,Sheldon>在我说之前  或许需要给你点心里缓冲
<1-3,Sheldon>Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,950
<1-3,Sheldon>你的脸对称得很讨喜
<1-3,Sheldon>You're face is pleasingly symmetrical.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,740
<1-4,Leonard>你就说吧
<1-4,Leonard>Just tell me.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,570
<1-5,Sheldon>一个瑞典的物理学家团队
<1-5,Sheldon>A Swedish team of physicists

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,020
<1-5,Sheldon>想要抢先一步进行我们的超流体漩涡实验
<1-5,Sheldon>is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,890
<1-6,Leonard>好吧  这是有点恶心
<1-6,Leonard>Oh, well, that kind of stinks.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,650
<1-6,Leonard>什么叫"有点恶心"
<1-6,Leonard>"That kind of stinks"?

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,230
<1-7,Sheldon>你应该要更不爽啊
<1-7,Sheldon>Why aren't you more upset?

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,930
<1-7,Sheldon>我刚才给你缓冲太多了吗
<1-7,Sheldon>Did I soften the blow too much?

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,160
<1-7,Sheldon>因为这副尊容更像是一幅毕加索的抽象画
<1-7,Sheldon>Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.

14
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,470
<1-8,Leonard>那我们要怎么办
<1-8,Leonard>What are we going to do?

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,040
<1-9,Sheldon>立刻进行实验
<1-9,Sheldon>Perform the experiment immediately.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,640
<1-10,Leonard>我也想  但我们需要液氦
<1-10,Leonard>I'd love to, but we need liquid helium

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,740
<1-10,Leonard>而我们订的氦要晚一个月才到
<1-10,Leonard>and our shipment's on back order for a month.

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,890
<1-11,Sheldon>什么  一个月  你跟我闹呢
<1-11,Sheldon>A month? What? Are you kidding me?

19
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,540
<1-11,Sheldon>现在就很适合你给我做心里缓冲啊
<1-11,Sheldon>That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,930
<1-12,Leonard>这T恤能衬托出你那深邃的蓝眸
<1-12,Leonard>That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.

21
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,670
<1-13,Sheldon>谢谢  你嘴真甜
<1-13,Sheldon>Thank you. Aren't you sweet.

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,180
<1-14,Leonard>我们去查查大学里
<1-14,Leonard>Let's go check to see if the university

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,880
<1-14,Leonard>还有没有氦气存货吧
<1-14,Leonard>has any helium in reserve.

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,630
<1-15,Sheldon>你知道我今天差点就不穿这件衣服吗
<1-15,Sheldon>Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today?

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,060
<2-1,Leonard>巴里  我们碰到了麻烦
<2-1,Leonard>Hey, Barry, we're in trouble.

26
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,270
<2-1,Leonard>我们需要液氦
<2-1,Leonard>We need liquid helium--

27
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,830
<2-1,Leonard>系里有多余的可以让我们用吗
<2-1,Leonard>does the department have any we can use?

28
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,070
<2-1,Leonard>抱歉  这东西有些短缺
<2-1,Leonard>Sorry, there's a shortage.

29
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,160
<2-2,Barry>而仅有的存货  我要拿来做量子激发研究
<2-2,Barry>And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,250
<2-3,Sheldon>你那个实验不需要用多少啊
<2-3,Sheldon>But you won't need much for that.

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,540
<2-4,Barry>的确  但如果成功了
<2-4,Barry>True, but if it's successful,

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,670
<2-4,Barry>我开派对要拿来灌气球啊
<2-4,Barry>I'm having a party with balloons.

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,460
<2-5,Leonard>别这样  巴里  有个瑞典团队
<2-5,Leonard>Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,980
<2-5,Leonard>想抢先进行我们的实验
<2-5,Leonard>trying to run our experiment before us.

35
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,300
<2-5,Leonard>你真不能匀一点给我们吗
<2-5,Leonard>Can't you spare any?

36
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,130
<2-6,Barry>你们老实说  如果今天换我碰到这情况
<2-6,Barry>Be honest-- if the shoe was on the other foot,

37
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,790
<2-6,Barry>你们会愿意帮我吗
<2-6,Barry>would you do this for me?

38
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,750
<2-7,Leonard>-会  -不可能
<2-7,Leonard>- Yes. - No chance.

39
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,510
<2-9,Leonard>你帮倒忙呢
<2-9,Leonard>What are you doing?

40
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,610
<2-10,Sheldon>他说老实说  所以我老实说啊
<2-10,Sheldon>He said be honest, so I was honest.

41
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,800
<2-10,Sheldon>你母亲没教你吗  诚实为上
<2-10,Sheldon>Didn't your mother tell you? It's the best policy.

42
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,990
<2-10,Sheldon>所以你意下如何
<2-10,Sheldon>So, what do you say?

43
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,330
<2-11,Barry>下辈子吧
<2-11,Barry>Hell no.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,770
<2-12,Sheldon>他可以给我们点缓冲再说的
<2-12,Sheldon>He could've softened the blow.

45
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,280
<2-12,Sheldon>翻译：爱搞笑钱德勒赛  强迫症莫妮卡猫
<2-12,Sheldon>猫中之王  别扭大菜

55
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,230
<3-1,Raj>你们为啥需要找他要氦气
<3-1,Raj>Why do you need Kripke?

56
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,560
<3-1,Raj>你们不能直接去派对用品店买点吗
<3-1,Raj>Can't you just go to Party City for helium?

57
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,530
<3-2,Leonard>我们得跑遍它们全加州的店才够
<3-2,Leonard>We'd have to go to every Party City in California.

58
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,650
<3-3,Howard>听起来就像5月5日节时的你啊
<3-3,Howard>Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.

59
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,650
<3-3,Howard>墨西哥节日  庆祝某场战役的胜利
<3-3,Howard>在节日当日会有各种派对  舞蹈等等

60
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,350
<3-4,Raj>我办的那个派对到5月7日
<3-4,Raj>Hey, people were still talking about that party

61
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,370
<3-4,Raj>还有人赞不绝口呢
<3-4,Raj>on siete de Mayo.

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,500
<3-5,Sheldon>莱纳德  如果那个瑞典团队赢了我们
<3-5,Sheldon>Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us,

63
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,600
<3-5,Sheldon>我此生都再也不愿享用那个国家的东西了
<3-5,Sheldon>I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again.

64
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,860
<3-5,Sheldon>那真挺可惜的  因为瑞典的肉丸
<3-5,Sheldon>Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs

65
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,590
<3-5,Sheldon>是我最爱的用牙签插着吃的肉丸
<3-5,Sheldon>are my favorite toothpick-delivered meatball.

66
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,040
<3-6,Howard>如果你们真迫切需要液氦  我认识个人
<3-6,Howard>If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy

67
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,490
<3-6,Howard>他能帮你们搞到  前提是不许问太多问题
<3-6,Howard>who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.

68
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,500
<3-8,Sheldon>-他是何方神圣  -他在哪儿工作
<3-8,Sheldon>- Who is he? - Where does he work?

69
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,130
<3-9,Leonard>他怎么能搞到氦
<3-9,Leonard>How does he get the helium?

70
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,130
<3-10,Sheldon>问多少问题才算是太多问题
<3-10,Sheldon>How many questions are too many questions?

71
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,800
<3-11,Howard>或许他不适合你们
<3-11,Howard>Maybe he's not for you.

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,110
<3-12,Sheldon>四题  答案是四题
<3-12,Sheldon>Four questions. There answer's four.

73
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,170
<4-1,Bernadette>你知道之前谁晚上去约会了吗
<4-1,Bernadette>Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night?

74
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,130
<4-1,Bernadette>斯图尔特
<4-1,Bernadette>Stuart.

75
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,070
<4-2,Penny>那恭喜他啊
<4-2,Penny>Oh, good for him.

76
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,200
<4-3,Bernadette>我也这么觉得
<4-3,Bernadette>I thought so, too.

77
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,220
<4-4,Penny>所以这妞是无家可归还是要栽赃陷害他
<4-4,Penny>So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?

78
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,730
<4-5,Bernadette>他在手机上装了一个约会软件
<4-5,Bernadette>He's using some kind of dating app on his phone.

79
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,490
<4-6,Penny>叫什么
<4-6,Penny>Oh, which one?

80
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,950
<4-6,Penny>或许我们能让艾米也试试
<4-6,Penny>Maybe we can get Amy to try it.

81
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,200
<4-6,Penny>不知道
<4-6,Penny>I don't know.

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,540
<4-7,Bernadette>斯图尔特  你能过来一下吗
<4-7,Bernadette>Stuart, can you come in here?

83
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,370
<4-7,Bernadette>他试着跟我解释过
<4-7,Bernadette>He tried to explain it to me.

84
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,500
<4-7,Bernadette>上面会显示出附近的用户
<4-7,Bernadette>It shows you pictures of people nearby,

85
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,570
<4-7,Bernadette>你能左右滑动换人看  看起来像个游戏
<4-7,Bernadette>you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.

86
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,930
<4-8,Penny>如果你游戏输了  你就得跟斯图尔特约会
<4-8,Penny>Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.

87
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,510
<4-9,Stuart>找我干嘛
<4-9,Stuart>What's up?

88
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,340
<4-10,Bernadette>你能给我们看看那个约会软件吗
<4-10,Bernadette>Can you show us that dating app?

89
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,810
<4-11,Stuart>可以啊  行
<4-11,Stuart>Oh, yeah, sure.

90
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,690
<4-11,Stuart>这软件真是改变了我的人生
<4-11,Stuart>This thing has changed my life.

91
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,340
<4-12,Penny>所以你约到了几个姑娘
<4-12,Penny>Wow. So how many girls have you met?

92
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,280
<4-12,Penny>2个
<4-12,Penny>Two.

93
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,170
<4-13,Stuart>我想我不用多说
<4-13,Stuart>I probably don't need to mention

94
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,270
<4-13,Stuart>2跟0之间相隔了"1"个世界吧
<4-13,Stuart>there's an entire number between that and zero.

95
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,050
<4-14,Penny>这软件怎么用
<4-14,Penny>Well, so how does it work?

96
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,590
<4-15,Stuart>上面会显示出
<4-15,Stuart>Uh, well, it-it shows me all

97
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,960
<4-15,Stuart>方圆八公里内所有使用这软件的
<4-15,Stuart>the single women in a five-mile radius

98
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,220
<4-15,Stuart>单身女子
<4-15,Stuart>who are using the app.

99
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,650
<4-15,Stuart>如果我喜欢她们的长相  那就点"赞"
<4-15,Stuart>If I like the way they look, I hit "Thumbs up."

100
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,280
<4-15,Stuart>如果不喜欢  就点"烂"
<4-15,Stuart>If I don't, "Thumbs down."

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,860
<4-16,Bernadette>那怎么样的情况会让你给姑娘点"烂"呢
<4-16,Bernadette>Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?

102
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,470
<4-17,Stuart>首次发生时  我会告诉你
<4-17,Stuart>First time it happens I will let you know.

103
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,040
<5-1,Leonard>我收到那个氦气男的回信了
<5-1,Leonard>Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.

104
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,530
<5-2,Sheldon>他怎么说
<5-2,Sheldon>What's he say?

105
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,070
<5-3,Leonard>他有我们要的东西  可以今晚交易
<5-3,Leonard>He's got what we need and can meet us tonight.

106
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,270
<5-3,Leonard>是吗
<5-3,Leonard>Oh, really?

107
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,010
<5-4,Sheldon>你知道我不喜欢晚上买东西
<5-4,Sheldon>You know I don't like buying things at night.

108
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,020
<5-4,Sheldon>2009年1月7日
<5-4,Sheldon>January 7, 2009.

109
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,910
<5-4,Sheldon>我晚上11点半去买
<5-4,Sheldon>I went to the Ralph's at 11:30pm to pick up

110
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,030
<5-4,Sheldon>隔天早餐要吃的燕麦片  然后我看到了啥
<5-4,Sheldon>Cracklin' Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?

111
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,530
<5-5,Leonard>在给早餐谷物架补货的店员
<5-5,Leonard>The man restocking the cereal shelves.

112
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,050
<5-6,Sheldon>没错  他干嘛了
<5-6,Sheldon>That's right. And what did he do?

113
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,560
<5-7,Leonard>他直接把早餐片递给了你  然后叫你瘦竹竿
<5-7,Leonard>He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.

114
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,690
<5-8,Sheldon>伤心往事历历在目啊
<5-8,Sheldon>It's like it was yesterday.

115
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,940
<5-9,Leonard>那你到底还想不想要液氦了
<5-9,Leonard>Do you want liquid helium or not?

116
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,010
<5-10,Sheldon>我当然想要啊
<5-10,Sheldon>Of course I do.

117
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,010
<5-10,Sheldon>我不想被那个瑞典团队捷足先登
<5-10,Sheldon>I don't want that Swedish team scooping us.

118
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,410
<5-11,Leonard>那我告诉他我们同意
<5-11,Leonard>Then I'm going to tell him we're in.

119
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,280
<5-12,Sheldon>莱纳德  等等  这非常不道德
<5-12,Sheldon>Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.

120
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,740
<5-13,Leonard>我们只是稍微变通一下
<5-13,Leonard>We're just bending the rules a little.

121
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,210
<5-13,Leonard>我们有进行实验的拨款
<5-13,Leonard>We have grant money to do the experiment,

122
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,520
<5-13,Leonard>所以我们拿这款项去买实验需要的氦
<5-13,Leonard>so we're going to spend it on the helium we need.

123
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,350
<5-13,Leonard>这又不像戈德法布博士
<5-13,Leonard>It's not like when Dr. Goldfarb

124
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,500
<5-13,Leonard>对外声称自己买了一个电子显微镜
<5-13,Leonard>claimed he bought an electron microscope

125
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,320
<5-13,Leonard>而真相是他在
<5-13,Leonard>and he was really just keeping

126
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,560
<5-13,Leonard>在加州范奈司的金屋藏"金丝猫"
<5-13,Leonard>a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.

127
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,460
<5-14,Sheldon>那女孩帮他做研究吗
<5-14,Sheldon>Was she helping him with his research?

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,160
<5-15,Leonard>"当然"
<5-15,Leonard>Sure.

129
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,960
<5-15,Leonard>我们到底要不要买
<5-15,Leonard>So, are we doing this?

130
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,680
<5-16,Sheldon>好吧  可他的氦是从哪里弄来的
<5-16,Sheldon>Okay, but where does he get the helium?

131
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,370
<5-17,Leonard>还记得吗  不许多问
<5-17,Leonard>Remember? Don't ask too many questions?

132
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,580
<5-18,Sheldon>但这有违我们大学的校规
<5-18,Sheldon>Uh, but this is violating university code.

133
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,210
<5-19,Leonard>稍微有点  但...
<5-19,Leonard>A little, but...

134
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,710
<5-19,Leonard>爱因斯坦曾说过
<5-19,Leonard>if I may quote Einstein,

135
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,210
<5-19,Leonard>"追求科学需要我们
<5-19,Leonard>"The pursuit of science calls us

136
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,850
<5-19,Leonard>抛开一切规章制度"
<5-19,Leonard>to ignore the rules set by man."

137
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,800
<5-20,Sheldon>好吧  买吧
<5-20,Sheldon>All right, do it.

138
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,320
<5-20,Sheldon>告诉他我们同意见面
<5-20,Sheldon>Tell him we're in.

139
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,820
<5-21,Leonard>好了
<5-21,Leonard>Done.

140
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,050
<5-22,Sheldon>我在网上查不到爱因斯坦那句话
<5-22,Sheldon>I can't find that quote on the Internet.

141
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,780
<5-22,Sheldon>是不是你瞎编的
<5-22,Sheldon>Did you make that up?

142
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,280
<5-23,Leonard>在回答之前
<5-23,Leonard>Before I answer,

143
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,230
<5-23,Leonard>我得先说  你的皮肤也太好了吧
<5-23,Leonard>may I just say your skin has never looked better.

<5-24,Sheldon>你的嘴呀  跟抹了蜜一样
<5-24,Sheldon>Aren't you just made of sugar.

145
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,410
<6-1,Amy>我不确定对此该作何感想
<6-1,Amy>I'm not sure how I feel about this.

146
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,090
<6-2,Penny>放心  就让他把软件装你手机上吧
<6-2,Penny>Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.

147
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,220
<6-3,Bernadette>对啊  斯尔图特约到了两个妞呢
<6-3,Bernadette>Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.

148
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,810
<6-4,Stuart>其中一个要没拒绝我  早发展到床上了
<6-4,Stuart>One of which would've ended in sex had she not said no.

149
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
<6-4,Stuart>好了  装好了
<6-4,Stuart>Okay, all set.

<6-6,Bernadette>泪滴图案的纹身
<6-6,Bernadette>Doesn't a teardrop tattoo

155
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,520
<6-6,Bernadette>不是代表他曾杀过人吗
<6-6,Bernadette>mean he murdered someone?

156
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,020
<6-7,Penny>他对此感到痛心啊
<6-7,Penny>And he's sad about it.

<6-9,Raj>我以为你很晚才会回来呢
<6-9,Raj>Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?

158
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,490
<6-10,Penny>如果你想让我晚点回家
<6-10,Penny>If you wanted me to stay out later,

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,580
<7-1,Leonard>那一定是他
<7-1,Leonard>That must be him.

178
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,860
<7-2,Sheldon>肯定啦
<7-2,Sheldon>Oh, of course.

179
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,690
<7-2,Sheldon>一辆没有标识的全白面包车
<7-2,Sheldon>An nondescript, white panel van.

180
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,500
<7-2,Sheldon>以下这句话你可能会听着耳熟
<7-2,Sheldon>You may be familiar with it from the sentence:

181
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,760
<7-2,Sheldon>"他们的尸体
<7-2,Sheldon>"Their bodies were found

182
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,440
<7-2,Sheldon>是在一辆没有标识的全白面包车内找到"
<7-2,Sheldon>in a nondescript, white panel van."

183
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,310
<7-4,Man>你们好
<7-4,Man>What's up?

184
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,500
<7-5,Leonard>我是莱纳德
<7-5,Leonard>Uh, I'm Leonard.

185
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,860
<7-5,Leonard>-这位是我的朋友  -叫我兽主甘
<7-5,Leonard>- This is my friend-- - I'm Skippy.

186
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,550
<7-6,Sheldon>兽主甘·卡瓦诺
<7-6,Sheldon>Skippy Cavanaugh.

187
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,910
<7-7,Man>好
<7-7,Man>Great.

188
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,830
<7-7,Man>钱带来了吗
<7-7,Man>You got the cash?

189
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,130
<7-8,Leonard>带来了  在这里呢
<7-8,Leonard>Uh, yeah, uh, right here.

190
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,540
<7-9,Sheldon>等等  且慢且慢
<7-9,Sheldon>Wait, hold on, hold on.

191
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,730
<7-9,Sheldon>我们怎么知道
<7-9,Sheldon>How do we know that you're not gonna

192
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,090
<7-9,Sheldon>你不会拿了钱就跑
<7-9,Sheldon>take the money and drive away?

193
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,190
<7-10,Leonard>你这是干嘛  兽主甘
<7-10,Leonard>What ya doing, Skippy?

194
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,660
<7-11,Sheldon>这是跟70年代的罪案连续剧学的
<7-11,Sheldon>Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us.

195
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,170
<7-11,Sheldon>你先把氦给我们
<7-11,Sheldon>You give us the helium first.

196
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,510
<7-12,Man>我怎么知道你们会不会收了货
<7-12,Man>Oh, how do I know you're not gonna

197
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,540
<7-12,Man>不给钱就跑啊
<7-12,Man>drive away without paying me?

198
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,190
<7-13,Sheldon>看来我不是唯一一个
<7-13,Sheldon>Guess I'm not the only one

199
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,630
<7-13,Sheldon>会看70年代罪案连续剧的人
<7-13,Sheldon>who watches '70s television crime dramas.

200
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,630
<7-14,Leonard>听着  你可以信任我们
<7-14,Leonard>Look, you can trust us.

201
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,370
<7-14,Leonard>我们是受人尊敬的科学家
<7-14,Leonard>We're respected scientists.

202
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,910
<7-15,Sheldon>他是
<7-15,Sheldon>Well, he is.

203
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,920
<7-15,Sheldon>我是一名婚礼策划师
<7-15,Sheldon>I'm a wedding planner,

204
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,060
<7-15,Sheldon>然而自己却找不到真爱
<7-15,Sheldon>who can't find love himself.

205
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,630
<7-15,Sheldon>虽然很讽刺  但重点是
<7-15,Sheldon>It's ironic, but the point is

206
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,850
<7-15,Sheldon>我们无法信任你
<7-15,Sheldon>we can't trust you.

207
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,920
<7-15,Sheldon>你只是个在停车场的鬼祟男
<7-15,Sheldon>You're a sketchy character in a parking garage.

208
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,160
<7-16,Man>没错  在我看来
<7-16,Man>Yeah, well, from my perspective,

209
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,140
<7-16,Man>你们俩也是鬼祟男
<7-16,Man>that's how you two appear to me.

210
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,770
<7-17,Sheldon>我从未这样想过
<7-17,Sheldon>Well, I never thought of it like that.

211
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,050
<7-17,Sheldon>天啊  参照系让人措手不及
<7-17,Sheldon>Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won't it?

212
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,730
<7-18,Leonard>我朋友对钱的担心不无道理
<7-18,Leonard>My friend does make a decent point about the money.

213
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,990
<7-18,Leonard>我也觉得先给钱不妥
<7-18,Leonard>I don't feel comfortable just handing it over up front.

214
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,680
<7-19,Man>不给钱  不给氦
<7-19,Man>Ah-ah-ah, no money, no helium.

215
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,730
<7-19,Man>看来我们陷入了"逼和"的局面
<7-19,Man>Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.

216
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,350
<7-20,Sheldon>严格来说不算
<7-20,Sheldon>Not technically.

217
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,760
<7-20,Sheldon>在国际象棋中  "逼和"指的局面是
<7-20,Sheldon>In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation

218
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,520
<7-20,Sheldon>无棋可动  无路可走
<7-20,Sheldon>in which there are no remaining moves.

219
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,480
<7-20,Sheldon>你还有很多条路可以选
<7-20,Sheldon>Uh, you have plenty of moves available.

220
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,900
<7-20,Sheldon>你可以揍扁我们  然后把钱拿走
<7-20,Sheldon>You could beat us up and steal the money.

221
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,980
<7-20,Sheldon>你也可以杀了我们
<7-20,Sheldon>You could kill us, you know.

222
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,400
<7-20,Sheldon>你只是被自己的想象力限制了
<7-20,Sheldon>Really, you're only limited by your imagination.

223
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,630
<7-21,Man>这么多年来  虽然我嘴上说"逼和"
<7-21,Man>All these years, I've been using "stalemate,"

224
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,840
<7-21,Man>但我真正要表达的是"僵局"
<7-21,Man>when I really mean "impasse."

225
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,900
<7-21,Man>我感觉自己好傻
<7-21,Man>I feel foolish.

226
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,440
<7-22,Leonard>这都不重要  不管这是"逼和"
<7-22,Leonard>I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate

227
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
<7-22,Leonard>"僵局"或是"墨西哥对峙"
<7-22,Leonard>or an impasse or a Mexican standoff.

228
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,420
<7-22,Leonard>意为对峙多方为了个人利益而不愿放下武器
<7-22,Leonard>率先让步的局面

229
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,550
<7-22,Leonard>我们现在应该怎么办
<7-22,Leonard>What are we gonna do here?

230
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,420
<7-23,Man>等等  这怎么能算"墨西哥对峙"呢
<7-23,Man>Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it be a Mexican standoff?

231
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,870
<7-23,Man>谁都知道这种情况得有三方对峙
<7-23,Man>Everybody knows you need three sides for that.

232
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,460
<7-24,Sheldon>不一定
<7-24,Sheldon>Not necessarily.

233
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,770
<7-24,Sheldon>很多人争论"墨西哥对峙"的本质在于
<7-24,Sheldon>Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff

234
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,800
<7-24,Sheldon>就是没人能够全身而退
<7-24,Sheldon>is that no one can walk away from the conflict

235
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,780
<7-24,Sheldon>却毫发无伤
<7-24,Sheldon>without incurring harm.

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,540
<7-25,Man>我没听明白
<7-25,Man>Hmm, I don't follow.

237
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,270
<7-26,Sheldon>我给你举个例子吧
<7-26,Sheldon>Let me give you an example.

238
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,980
<7-26,Sheldon>今天早些时候
<7-26,Sheldon>Earlier today,

239
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,100
<7-26,Sheldon>我破解了你电邮的标头隐藏资讯
<7-26,Sheldon>I decoded the headers on your e-mail,

240
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,390
<7-26,Sheldon>我知道你的名字叫肯尼斯·菲兹杰拉德
<7-26,Sheldon>and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald.

241
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,180
<7-26,Sheldon>然后我找出了你的住址和工作地点
<7-26,Sheldon>From that, I figured out where you live and where you work.

242
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,430
<7-26,Sheldon>现在  要把情况变成"墨西哥对峙"
<7-26,Sheldon>Now, to make this a Mexican standoff,

243
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,010
<7-26,Sheldon>我会说些类似这样的话
<7-26,Sheldon>I would say something like, uh,

244
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,960
<7-26,Sheldon>"给我氦气  不然我就去当局告发你"
<7-26,Sheldon>"You give us the helium or I'll turn you in to the authorities."

245
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
<7-27,Man>你这是在威胁我吗
<7-27,Man>Is that a threat?

246
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,370
<7-28,Sheldon>没错  看  你开始懂了嘛
<7-28,Sheldon>Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.

247
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,440
<7-29,Man>好呀  我也知道你们在哪里工作
<7-29,Man>Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right?

248
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,150
<7-29,Man>如果你们想整我  我就举报你
<7-29,Man>And if you mess with me, I'll report you,

249
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,230
<7-29,Man>然后我会把你俩揍得亲娘都认不出
<7-29,Man>then I'll pound your asses into the ground.

250
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,160
<7-30,Sheldon>太棒了  现在这才叫"墨西哥对峙"
<7-30,Sheldon>Perfect! Now we really are in a Mexican standoff.

251
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,640
<7-30,Sheldon>是不是又到了那种
<7-30,Sheldon>Is this one of those times

252
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,670
<7-30,Sheldon>我赢了战役  却输了战争的局面
<7-30,Sheldon>where I've won the battle but lost the war?

253
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,780
<7-31,Leonard>恐怕是哦  兽主甘
<7-31,Leonard>Afraid so, Skippy.

254
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,290
<7-32,Sheldon>我就说咱们不该晚上出来买东西
<7-32,Sheldon>I told you we shouldn't go shopping at night.

255
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,560
<7-33,Leonard>好了  大家都冷静一下
<7-33,Leonard>All right, let's all just calm down.

256
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,230
<7-33,Leonard>谁都不想举报谁
<7-33,Leonard>Nobody wants to report anybody.

257
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,490
<7-34,Man>我不喜欢跟你们做买卖  我要走了
<7-34,Man>No, I don't like this. I'm out.

258
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,780
<7-35,Leonard>别别  等一下  不要走
<7-35,Leonard>No, no, no. Wait, don't go.

259
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,550
<7-35,Leonard>请听我解释
<7-35,Leonard>Just let me explain.

260
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,250
<7-35,Leonard>我们是物理学家  我们只是想证明
<7-35,Leonard>We're physicists, and we're trying to prove a hypothesis

261
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,400
<7-35,Leonard>一个我们研究了一年的假设而已
<7-35,Leonard>that we've been working on for over a year.

262
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,370
<7-36,Man>真的吗  什么假设
<7-36,Man>Really? What's the hypothesis?

263
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,720
<7-37,Sheldon>时空可以用
<7-37,Sheldon>Space-time can be interpreted as

264
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,110
<7-37,Sheldon>一个N维超流体的表面来解释
<7-37,Sheldon>the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.

265
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,730
<7-38,Man>有可能哦  有可能
<7-38,Man>Could be, could be.

266
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,810
<7-38,Man>说下去
<7-38,Man>Go on.

267
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,210
<7-39,Leonard>现在有一个瑞典团队读了我们的论文
<7-39,Leonard>Okay, but now there's this Swedish team that read our paper

268
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,940
<7-39,Leonard>想抢先我们一步获得实验成果
<7-39,Leonard>and they're trying to beat us to our own discovery.

269
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,510
<7-39,Leonard>所以我们真的很需要这罐氦气
<7-39,Leonard>We really need this helium.

270
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,770
<7-40,Sheldon>抱歉我之前撒谎
<7-40,Sheldon>And I'm sorry I lied about

271
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,340
<7-40,Sheldon>说我自己是没人爱的婚礼策划师
<7-40,Sheldon>being a wedding planner who can't find love.

272
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,690
<7-40,Sheldon>不过我现在的确是单身  你有人可以介绍给我吗
<7-40,Sheldon>Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.

273
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,450
<7-41,Leonard>钱给你  买卖能继续吗
<7-41,Leonard>Here's the money. Can we do this?

274
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,680
<7-41,Leonard>好吧
<7-41,Leonard>Okay.

275
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,390
<7-42,Man>那些占你们便宜的科学家实在太不要脸了
<7-42,Man>It's a shame about those scientists ripping you off.

276
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,980
<7-42,Man>我还以为瑞典的朋友们
<7-42,Man>I expected a higher ethical standard

277
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,960
<7-42,Man>道德标准会更高呢
<7-42,Man>from our friends in Sweden.

278
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,900
<7-43,Leonard>这事在我们学术界其实挺常见的
<7-43,Leonard>It's actually pretty common in our field.

279
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,710
<7-43,Leonard>我们也拿他们没办法
<7-43,Leonard>Not much you can do about it.

280
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,000
<7-44,Man>如果你们出的价够高
<7-44,Man>Well, for the right amount of money,

281
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,780
<7-44,Man>又知道他们的住址
<7-44,Man>if you know where they live,

282
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,170
<7-44,Man>我倒是知道好多种对付他们的"办法"
<7-44,Man>there's, uh, plenty we could do about it.

283
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,450
<7-45,Sheldon>听到了吗  莱纳德
<7-45,Sheldon>Did you hear that, Leonard?

284
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,570
<7-45,Sheldon>我们有好多种对付他们的办法呢
<7-45,Sheldon>There's plenty we could do about it.

285
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,850
<7-45,Sheldon>你有名片吗
<7-45,Sheldon>Do you have a card?

286
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,400
<8-1,Penny>好了  出来啦
<8-1,Penny>Okay, here we go.

287
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,820
<8-1,Penny>现在大家都能看到了
<8-1,Penny>Now everyone can see.

288
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,520
<8-1,Penny>好的
<8-1,Penny>All right.

289
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,180
<8-1,Penny>大家觉得斗鸡眼麦克如何啊
<8-1,Penny>Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?

290
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,290
<8-2,Raj>好歹他不能乱瞟看别的姑娘了
<8-2,Raj>You know he won't be looking at other girls.

291
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,940
<8-3,Howard>除非她们坐在他鼻头上
<8-3,Howard>Unless they're sitting on the end of his nose.

292
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,430
<8-4,Penny>好  好  好   按"烂"
<8-4,Penny>Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down.

293
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,000
<8-4,Penny>下一个
<8-4,Penny>Next.

294
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,060
<8-5,Bernadette>看看他那一嘴小牙齿
<8-5,Bernadette>Ew, check out his tiny teeth.

295
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,160
<8-5,Bernadette>他好像一只人形海豚
<8-5,Bernadette>He looks like a man-dolphin.

296
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
<8-6,Penny>如果他床技超群  你可以丢一条小鱼作奖励
<8-6,Penny>Wait, if he's good in bed, she can throw him a fish.

297
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,640
<8-7,Howard>我爱你  艾米
<8-7,Howard>I love you, Amy.

298
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,040
<8-8,Amy>我开始有罪恶感了
<8-8,Amy>Okay, I'm starting to feel guilty.

299
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,410
<8-8,Amy>我们是不是太毒舌了啊
<8-8,Amy>Aren't we being a little mean?

300
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,470
<8-9,Raj>你说得对
<8-9,Raj>That's a fair point.

301
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,670
<8-9,Raj>我们肯定不会当着本人的面这么取笑他
<8-9,Raj>We wouldn't make fun of someone like this to their face.

302
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,170
<8-10,Penny>看  是斯图尔特
<8-10,Penny>Look, it's Stuart!

303
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,770
<8-11,Raj>你最好回避一下吧
<8-11,Raj>You may want to leave the room.

304
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,440
<9-1,Sheldon>这边请  哈维叔叔
<9-1,Sheldon>Right this way, Uncle Harvey.

305
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,500
<9-2,Leonard>你能不能别装了
<9-2,Leonard>Will you stop with that already?

306
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,340
<9-3,Sheldon>我这是在避免引人注意
<9-3,Sheldon>I'm trying not to attract attention.

307
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,010
<9-4,Leonard>你让他向清洁女工脱帽致意还不够引人注意吗
<9-4,Leonard>And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?

308
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,030
<9-5,Sheldon>她说了"晚安"[西语]  我叔叔还能怎么做
<9-5,Sheldon>She said, "Buenas noches." What was he supposed to do?

309
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,530
<9-6,Leonard>我们还是赶紧开始实验吧
<9-6,Leonard>Let's just start the experiment.

310
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,260
<9-7,Sheldon>莱纳德  我们应该把故事编圆了
<9-7,Sheldon>Leonard, we should probably have our story straight

311
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,410
<9-7,Sheldon>以防到时被抓住
<9-7,Sheldon>in case we get caught.

312
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,600
<9-8,Leonard>我们不会被抓的
<9-8,Leonard>We're not getting caught.

313
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,380
<9-9,Sheldon>你又不能保证这一点
<9-9,Sheldon>Well, you can't be sure of that.

314
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,900
<9-9,Sheldon>万一卖氦气的人出卖我们呢
<9-9,Sheldon>What if the helium dealer rats us out?

315
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,610
<9-9,Sheldon>万一克里普奇问起这氦气的来历呢
<9-9,Sheldon>What if Kripke asks where we got it?

316
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,790
<9-9,Sheldon>万一学校查了我的家谱
<9-9,Sheldon>What if the university checks my family tree

317
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,770
<9-9,Sheldon>发现我根本就没有一个哈维叔叔怎么办
<9-9,Sheldon>and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey?

318
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,020
<9-10,Leonard>卖家没这么无聊  克里普奇又管不着我们
<9-10,Leonard>The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us,

319
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,100
<9-10,Leonard>而你和金属罐子有亲属关系
<9-10,Leonard>and you being related to a metal container

320
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,950
<9-10,Leonard>反而更能解释你的种种
<9-10,Leonard>would explain a lot.

321
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,280
<9-10,Leonard>帮我把它接起来
<9-10,Leonard>Help me hook this up.

322
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,220
<9-12,Leonard>怎么了
<9-12,Leonard>What?

323
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,100
<9-13,Sheldon>-你看到这个贴纸了吗   -怎么了
<9-13,Sheldon>- Well, did you see this sticker? - What is it?

324
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,840
<9-15,Sheldon>虽然掉了一大半  不过剩下部分还依稀可见
<9-15,Sheldon>It's partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads:

325
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,230
<9-15,Sheldon>专属财产和一个U字
<9-15,Sheldon>"Property of" and the letter "U."

326
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,770
<9-16,Leonard>可能是南加大  或加州大学洛杉矶分校吧
<9-16,Leonard>It's probably USC or UCLA.

327
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,070
<9-17,Sheldon>但万一指的是美国[U.S.]政府专属财产怎么办
<9-17,Sheldon>Yeah, but what if it's "Property of U.S. Government"?

328
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,830
<9-17,Sheldon>德州的阿马里洛就有一个国家氦气保护区
<9-17,Sheldon>There's a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas.

329
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,110
<9-17,Sheldon>如果这个是从那里偷的
<9-17,Sheldon>If this was stolen from there,

330
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,510
<9-17,Sheldon>我们就犯下了联邦重罪
<9-17,Sheldon>we're accessories to a federal crime.

331
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,000
<9-18,Leonard>别这么快就下结论
<9-18,Leonard>Let's not jump to conclusions.

332
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,670
<9-18,Leonard>U可以指好多东西呢
<9-18,Leonard>A lot of things start with "U."

333
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,890
<9-19,Sheldon>你说得对
<9-19,Sheldon>That's true.

334
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,240
<9-19,Sheldon>可以指美国空军
<9-19,Sheldon>There's the U.S. Air Force,

335
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,770
<9-19,Sheldon>美国国防部  美国海军
<9-19,Sheldon>U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Navy,

336
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,040
<9-19,Sheldon>还可以指你和我一起吃牢饭
<9-19,Sheldon>"You" And I are going to jail.

337
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,790
<9-20,Leonard>听着  我们可以按计划做完实验
<9-20,Leonard>Listen, we can do the experiment as planned

338
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,390
<9-20,Leonard>让瑞典人哭着回家找妈妈
<9-20,Leonard>and beat the Swedish team to the punch,

339
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,010
<9-20,Leonard>或者我们可以和科研梦吻别
<9-20,Leonard>or we can kiss our dreams good-bye

340
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,970
<9-20,Leonard>因为我们不敢违反一点小规则
<9-20,Leonard>because we were to afraid to break a few rules.

341
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,230
<9-20,Leonard>女士您好
<9-20,Leonard>Ma'am.

342
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,070
<9-20,Leonard>好了  大家都记住规则了吗
<9-20,Leonard>Okay, does everyone remember the rules?

343
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,460
<9-20,Leonard>如果他没穿衣服  喝一口
<9-20,Leonard>If he's shirtless, one sip.

344
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,870
<11-1,Penny>带着宠物摆姿势  喝两口
<11-1,Penny>Posing with a pet, two sips.

345
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,760
<11-1,Penny>带宠物又没穿衣服  猛灌
<11-1,Penny>Pet and shirtless, chug like it's your job.

346
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,940
<11-1,Penny>开始
<11-1,Penny>And pull!

347
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,480
<11-2,Raj>这条内裤我也有
<11-2,Raj>I have that same underwear!

348
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,140
<11-3,Penny>灌
<11-3,Penny>Chug!

349
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,900
<11-4,Penny>艾米  你收到条短信
<11-4,Penny>Mm, Amy, you're getting a text.

350
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,240
<11-5,Amy>给我
<11-5,Amy>Oh, um, give me that.

351
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,360
<11-6,Raj>"昨晚玩得很愉快"
<11-6,Raj>"I had a great time last night."

353
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,830
<11-7,Amy>停停停  都别看了
<11-7,Amy>No, no, st-stop reading that.

354
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,990
<11-8,Howard>-谁是戴夫  -我...
<11-8,Howard>- Who's Dave?  - I...

355
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,920
<11-9,Penny>你昨晚上去约会了
<11-9,Penny>You went on a date last night?

356
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,090
<11-9,Penny>你在跟谁交往吗
<11-9,Penny>Are you seeing someone?

357
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,090
<11-10,Amy>没有  不是那样的
<11-10,Amy>No, it-it's not like that.

358
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,300
<11-11,Bernadette>"我很乐意再约你出来玩"
<11-11,Bernadette>"And I'd love to take you out again"?

359
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,470
<11-12,All>-艾米  -什么
<11-12,All>- Amy! - What?

360
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,860
<11-12,All>-难以置信啊  -我的神啊
<11-12,All>- Can't believe it. - Oh, my God.

361
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,860
<11-13,Amy>好吧  就是那样
<11-13,Amy>Okay, it's like that.

362
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,340
<12-1,Leonard>感谢你能回来
<12-1,Leonard>Thank you for coming back.

363
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,830
<12-2,Man>没事  通常情况下我不会的
<12-2,Man>Yeah, well, normally I wouldn't,

364
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,710
<12-2,Man>可我女儿跟她的朋友们今晚在我家住
<12-2,Man>but my daughter's having a sleepover, and there's only

365
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,600
<12-2,Man>尖叫加水果姐姐已经超越我的承受极限了
<12-2,Man>so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.

366
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,600
<12-2,Man>美国知名女歌手  歌曲大多唱女性自强自尊
<12-2,Man>颇受小女孩到青少年女性喜欢

367
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,650
<12-3,Sheldon>总之把钱还给我们
<12-3,Sheldon>Anyway, if you could just give us our money back,

368
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,190
<12-3,Sheldon>你拿走你的氦气  我们马上走
<12-3,Sheldon>you can have your helium and we'll be on our way.

369
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,940
<12-4,Man>好  它有什么问题吗
<12-4,Man>Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?

370
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,490
<12-5,Leonard>没有  我们只是改变主意了
<12-5,Leonard>No, nothing. We just changed our mind.

371
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,400
<12-6,Sheldon>他是四眼田鸡  我是自以为是的瘦竹竿
<12-6,Sheldon>He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all;

372
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
<12-6,Sheldon>我俩不适合蹲监狱
<12-6,Sheldon>we are not built for prison.

373
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,320
<12-7,Man>也是  有道理
<12-7,Man>Yeah, I hear you.

374
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,740
<12-7,Man>你们俩是好人  所以我...
<12-7,Man>Well, you're good guys, so I'll, uh...

375
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,790
<12-7,Man>我会把氦气拿走
<12-7,Man>I'll take the helium off your hands.

376
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,100
<12-8,Leonard>谢谢你
<12-8,Leonard>Thank you.

377
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,550
<12-9,Man>但是钱不能还给你们
<12-9,Man>But you ain't getting your money back.

378
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,220
<12-10,Sheldon>你是想占我俩便宜吗
<12-10,Sheldon>You're taking advantage of us?

379
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,330
<12-10,Sheldon>我们不是一起弄清过语义吗
<12-10,Sheldon>We clarified nomenclature together.

380
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,450
<12-11,Man>虽然我跟普通人一样都爱听语义教学
<12-11,Man>Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy,

381
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,680
<12-11,Man>可是在商言商嘛
<12-11,Man>but, uh, this is business.

382
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:41,920
<12-12,Leonard>算了
<12-12,Leonard>You know what?

383
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,180
<12-12,Leonard>就这样吧  钱你留着
<12-12,Leonard>It's fine. Keep the money.

384
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,810
<12-12,Leonard>我们只想赶紧脱手
<12-12,Leonard>We just want to be done with this.

385
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,600
<12-13,Man>没问题  但我得跟你们收点
<12-13,Man>No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you

386
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,190
<12-13,Man>氦气退货费
<12-13,Man>a small helium restocking fee.

387
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,530
<12-14,Sheldon>我不懂了
<12-14,Sheldon>I don't understand.

388
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,140
<12-15,Leonard>他想再要钱
<12-15,Leonard>He wants more money.

389
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,710
<12-16,Sheldon>那最好别超过一千美金
<12-16,Sheldon>Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars;

390
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,620
<12-16,Sheldon>我身上就这么多了
<12-16,Sheldon>that's all I've got on me.

391
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,670
<12-17,Man>正好就是那数
<12-17,Man>That's exactly how much it is.

392
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,680
<12-18,Sheldon>终于
<12-18,Sheldon>Finally,

393
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
<12-18,Sheldon>有个顺利的事了
<12-18,Sheldon>something breaks our way.

394
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,950
<13-1,Penny>不敢相信你居然在跟人约会
<13-1,Penny>I can't believe you're seeing someone

395
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,420
<13-1,Penny>而我们什么都不知道
<13-1,Penny>and we don't even know about it.

396
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,170
<13-2,Bernadette>对  你为什么不告诉我们呢
<13-2,Bernadette>Yeah, why wouldn't you tell us?

397
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,750
<13-3,Amy>因为这事才开始  又很奇怪
<13-3,Amy>Because it's new and weird

398
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,140
<13-3,Amy>我自己还在摸索阶段
<13-3,Amy>and I'm just trying to figure it all out.

399
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,700
<13-3,Amy>而且我知道  如果告诉了你们
<13-3,Amy>And I knew if I told you guys

400
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,260
<13-3,Amy>我已经跟几个人约过会了
<13-3,Amy>I had been out with a few people

401
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,710
<13-3,Amy>你们肯定会表现得太过兴奋
<13-3,Amy>that you'd get way too excited about it.

402
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,310
<13-4,Stuart>还几个人
<13-4,Stuart>A few people?

403
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,310
<13-6,Penny>-什么  -艾米
<13-6,Penny>- What?! - Amy!

404
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,330
<13-7,Stuart>所以我们能问问  进展如何吗
<13-7,Stuart>So, are we allowed to ask how it's going?

405
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,640
<13-8,Amy>还行
<13-8,Amy>It's going fine.

406
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,720
<13-8,Amy>基本就是跟人见面喝个咖啡
<13-8,Amy>It's mostly just been meeting people for coffee.

407
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,740
<13-8,Amy>什么
<13-8,Amy>Wha...?!

408
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,150
<13-9,Raj>我以为我们每次都要...
<13-9,Raj>I thought we were all...

409
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,490
<13-9,Raj>当我没说
<13-9,Raj>Never mind.

410
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,960
<13-10,Bernadette>我以为你还没准备好跟别人约会呢
<13-10,Bernadette>I-I thought you weren't ready to start seeing people.

411
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,060
<13-11,Amy>我没什么约会经验
<13-11,Amy>Well, I don't have much experience dating,

412
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,700
<13-11,Amy>所以觉得多出去见见世面
<13-11,Amy>so I decided it would be good for me

413
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,660
<13-11,Amy>对我来说是好事
<13-11,Amy>to, you know, get out there a little.

414
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,250
<13-12,Penny>挺好的
<13-12,Penny>Well, good for you.

415
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,840
<13-13,Amy>谢谢你
<13-13,Amy>Thank you.

416
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,140
<13-14,Bernadette>你已经约过几个人了
<13-14,Bernadette>And how many guys have you gone out with?

417
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,280
<13-15,Stuart>拜托不要超过2个
<13-15,Stuart>Please be less than two.

418
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,490
<13-17,Stuart>-3个  -靠
<13-17,Stuart>- Three. - Damn it.

419
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,050
<14-1,Sheldon>虽然我们可能会被瑞典人打败
<14-1,Sheldon>Well, the Swedes might beat us,

420
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,090
<14-1,Sheldon>可起码不用在监狱里被人"头皮转转功"
<14-1,Sheldon>but at least we won't get gang-noogied in prison.

421
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,610
<14-2,Leonard>监狱电影你是只看过《监狱宝贝蛋》吗
<14-2,Leonard>Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?

423
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,500
<14-3,Sheldon>那电影把宝宝我吓乖了  莱纳德
<14-3,Sheldon>It scared me straight, Leonard.

424
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,480
<14-4,Barry>我想了想
<14-4,Barry>Hey, I've been thinking.

425
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,180
<14-4,Barry>是我太小气了
<14-4,Barry>I was being petty.

426
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,240
<14-4,Barry>你们可以用我的氦气
<14-4,Barry>You can have my helium.

427
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,410
<14-5,Leonard>谢谢你  巴里
<14-5,Leonard>Thank you, Barry.

428
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,650
<14-6,Barry>但你们的论文得加上我的名字
<14-6,Barry>But you have to add my name to your paper.

429
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,720
<14-7,Sheldon>太荒谬了
<14-7,Sheldon>That's preposterous.

430
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,030
<14-8,Barry>我觉得挺公平的
<14-8,Barry>I don't know, seems fair.

431
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,670
<14-8,Barry>没我你们也做不成实验
<14-8,Barry>You can't do it without me.

432
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,500
<14-9,Leonard>给我们一分钟
<14-9,Leonard>Can you give us a minute?

433
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,600
<14-10,Barry>慢慢商量
<14-10,Barry>Take your time.

434
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,560
<14-10,Barry>为了做效果  我会慢慢倒退出去
<14-10,Barry>I'll walk out backwards for dramatic effect.

435
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,910
<14-11,Sheldon>我不喜欢这样被敲诈
<14-11,Sheldon>I don't like being extorted like this.

436
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,690
<14-11,Sheldon>尤其还是被他
<14-11,Sheldon>Especially by him of all people.

437
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,630
<14-12,Leonard>我也不喜欢  可我们别无选择
<14-12,Leonard>Me neither, but what other choice do we have?

438
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,420
<15-1,Leonard>我保证这是最后一次
<15-1,Leonard>I promise this is the last time.

439
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,910
<15-1,Leonard>维基百科上写着呢
<15-1,Leonard>It's says right here on the Wikipedia

440
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,120
<15-1,Leonard>"墨西哥对峙是由至少三方
<15-1,Leonard>"A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between

441
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,770
<16-1,Leonard>相对而立的结果"
<16-1,Leonard>at least three parties."

442
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,720
<16-2,Sheldon>你怎么敢信维基百科
<16-2,Sheldon>How can you trust Wikipedia

443
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,290
<16-2,Sheldon>他们居然用"相对而立"形容三方
<16-2,Sheldon>if they use "between" to refer to three parties?

444
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,470
<16-3,Helium Man>它们应该用三足鼎立  对不对
<16-3,Helium Man>They should've used "among," right?

445
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,200
<16-4,Sheldon>或者鼎分三足  如果他们想带点古风古韵
<16-4,Sheldon>Or "amongst," if they were feeling whimsically archaic.

446
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,790
<16-5,Helium Man>好了  别聊这些闲话了
<16-5,Helium Man>All right, enough with the chitchat.

447
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,090
<16-5,Helium Man>我们到底还看不看《监狱宝贝蛋》了
<16-5,Helium Man>Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?

448
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,010
<16-6,Sheldon>当然了
<16-6,Sheldon>Absolutely.

449
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,030
<16-6,Sheldon>但如果这部片子把你吓到从此老实做人
<16-6,Sheldon>But don't be surprised if this movie sets you

450
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,050
<16-6,Sheldon>你可别太吃惊
<16-6,Sheldon>on the straight and narrow.

451
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,550
<16-7,Helium Man>我这人乐于改变
<16-7,Helium Man>I am open to change.
