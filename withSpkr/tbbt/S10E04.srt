1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,080
<1-1,Amy>到处都是水
<1-1,Amy>There was water everywhere.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,290
<1-1,Amy>场面可惨了
<1-1,Amy>It was such a mess.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,470
<1-2,Leonard>太倒霉了  那你得暂离你公寓多久
<1-2,Leonard>That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,660
<1-3,Amy>大约五周吧
<1-3,Amy>About five weeks.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,080
<1-4,Penny>你有损失什么值钱财物吗
<1-4,Penny>Ugh! Did you lose anything valuable?

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,540
<1-5,Amy>那个管道是在我衣柜上方
<1-5,Amy>Well, the pipe was over my closet,

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,790
<1-5,Amy>所以我所有衣物全泡汤了
<1-5,Amy>so all my clothes are gone.

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,920
<1-6,Penny>那就是没损失  不错
<1-6,Penny>Oh, so nothing. Great.

9
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,750
<1-6,Penny>他们知道管道为何爆裂吗
<1-6,Penny>Do they know why the pipe burst?

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,950
<1-7,Amy>他们没说
<1-7,Amy>They didn't say.

11
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,760
<1-8,Leonard>那些使用了
<1-8,Leonard>Buildings that have a combination

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,520
<1-8,Leonard>铜管与镀锌钢管的建筑
<1-8,Leonard>of copper and galvanized steel

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,610
<1-8,Leonard>易受水中离子的电迁移率
<1-8,Leonard>are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion

14
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,940
<1-8,Leonard>而导致破洞跟腐蚀
<1-8,Leonard>caused by the mobility of ions in the water.

15
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,790
<1-8,Leonard>像我这样头常被恶霸塞进马桶里的人
<1-8,Leonard>Can't have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did

16
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,170
<1-8,Leonard>难免会学到一点管道方面的知识
<1-8,Leonard>and not pick up a few things about plumbing.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,630
<1-9,Penny>如果你需要地方暂住  你可以来跟我们住啊
<1-9,Penny>Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.

18
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,480
<1-10,Amy>-真的吗  -当然啦
<1-10,Amy>- Really? - Of course.

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,740
<1-11,Penny>你可以睡莱纳德的房间  我跟他住我家
<1-11,Penny>You can stay in Leonard's room, and we'll stay at my place.

20
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,370
<1-12,Amy>你确定不会造成你们不便吗
<1-12,Amy>You're sure that's not an inconvenience?

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,640
<1-13,Penny>不会  完全不会
<1-13,Penny>No, not at all.

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,000
<1-14,Leonard>而且我们跟谢尔顿住
<1-14,Leonard>And we live with Sheldon,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,470
<1-14,Leonard>"不便"这个词与我们早已是路人
<1-14,Leonard>so the word "inconvenience" has really lost all meaning.

24
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,440
<1-15,Amy>所以严格上来说  我要跟我男朋友同居了吗
<1-15,Amy>So, technically, I'd be moving in with my boyfriend?

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,540
<1-16,Penny>算吧
<1-16,Penny>I guess so.

26
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,530
<1-16,Penny>而我也终于可以单独跟我丈夫同住了
<1-16,Penny>I'd finally get to live alone with my husband.

27
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,790
<1-17,Amy>天啊  关系迈进了一大步啊
<1-17,Amy>Oh, my, this is a big step.

28
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,010
<1-18,Leonard>对于咱俩来说  是朝着正确方向迈进
<1-18,Leonard>For two of us, it's in the right direction.

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,180
<1-19,Sheldon>你们为啥都笑得跟傻子一样
<1-19,Sheldon>Why are you all smiling like crazy people?

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,860
<2-1,Sheldon>与我女友住同一屋檐下吗
<2-1,Sheldon>Cohabitation with my girlfriend?

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,110
<2-1,Sheldon>这可是件大事啊
<2-1,Sheldon>That's a great deal to process.

41
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,680
<2-2,Leonard>只是同住五周而已
<2-2,Leonard>It's only for five weeks.

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,380
<2-3,Penny>而且我们俩就在对门而已
<2-3,Penny>Yeah, and we'll be right across the hall.

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,620
<2-4,Amy>你觉得呢
<2-4,Amy>What do you think?

44
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,290
<2-4,Amy>我也不知道
<2-4,Amy>I don't know.

45
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,440
<2-5,Sheldon>万一同住之后浪漫的火花就没了呢
<2-5,Sheldon>What if living together kills the romance?

46
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,060
<2-6,Penny>你们俩滚过足足一次床单呢
<2-6,Penny>Okay, you guys had sex one whole time.

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,420
<2-6,Penny>没有任何事能灭了那"大火"
<2-6,Penny>Nothing can put out a fire like that.

48
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,770
<2-7,Sheldon>但当我们互相看到了私底下最私密的一面呢
<2-7,Sheldon>Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain?

49
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,970
<2-7,Sheldon>她还没见过我没刮胡子的样子呢
<2-7,Sheldon>I mean, she's never even seen me unshaven.

50
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,570
<2-8,Leonard>你昨天刚刮过了
<2-8,Leonard>You just shaved yesterday.

51
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,670
<2-8,Leonard>你接下来三个月都没有这问题
<2-8,Leonard>You're good for three months.

52
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,380
<2-9,Amy>谢尔顿  我能理解你的考量
<2-9,Amy>Sheldon, I understand your apprehension,

53
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,490
<2-9,Amy>但请让我用科学家角度说服你
<2-9,Amy>but let me appeal to the scientist in you.

54
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,240
<2-9,Amy>同住的时间是五周
<2-9,Amy>Given the five-week end date,

55
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,270
<2-9,Amy>这长度正好适合我们来实验彼此契合度
<2-9,Amy>isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment

56
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,290
<2-9,Amy>并搜集数据不是吗
<2-9,Amy>and collect data on our compatibility?

57
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,370
<2-10,Sheldon>少用这种撩人的话来套路我
<2-10,Sheldon>Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.

58
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,980
<2-10,Sheldon>这么说吧
<2-10,Sheldon>Okay.

59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,740
<2-11,Leonard>电视剧《星际旅行：初代》
<2-11,Leonard>Star Trek: The Original Series.

60
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,420
<2-11,Leonard>进取号开始了一个五年期探索新世界的任务
<2-11,Leonard>The Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds.

61
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,320
<2-11,Leonard>把这件事
<2-11,Leonard>Think of this as your

62
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,530
<2-11,Leonard>也想成是你个人的五周期任务嘛
<2-11,Leonard>personal five-week mission to do the same.

63
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,670
<2-12,Sheldon>你想用撩人的话来套路我  就得像他这样
<2-12,Sheldon>If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it.

64
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,790
<2-13,Penny>你有毛好骄傲啊
<2-13,Penny>Don't be proud of that.

65
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,680
<2-14,Amy>所以你同意了吗
<2-14,Amy>So, is that a yes?

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,160
<2-15,Sheldon>还没呢  我...
<2-15,Sheldon>Not yet. I...

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,380
<2-15,Sheldon>我如何能确定我是跟艾米相住愉快
<2-15,Sheldon>How will I learn if I'm comfortable living with Amy

68
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,740
<2-15,Sheldon>还是因为只是在自己家里待得舒服呢
<2-15,Sheldon>or just comfortable because I'm in my own apartment?

69
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,690
<2-15,Sheldon>如果要让这个实验有效
<2-15,Sheldon>Now, if this experiment is going to be valid,

70
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,660
<2-15,Sheldon>我建议我跟她得住在中立环境
<2-15,Sheldon>I suggest a neutral environment.

71
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,930
<2-16,Penny>那你们要住哪去
<2-16,Penny>Well, where would you go?

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,530
<2-17,Sheldon>理想来说  在新墨西哥州的
<2-17,Sheldon>Well, ideally, an enclosed,

73
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,580
<2-17,Sheldon>一个封闭式  能自给自足的生态馆里
<2-17,Sheldon>self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico.

74
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,080
<2-17,Sheldon>在那里我们吃用我们排泄物施肥的农作物
<2-17,Sheldon>Where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,650
<2-18,Leonard>同住怕不浪漫  吃屎就浪漫了吗
<2-18,Leonard>And you were worried about the romance.

76
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,040
<2-19,Penny>等等  那你们怎么不直接住去我家
<2-19,Penny>Wait. Why don't you guys stay across the hall,

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
<2-19,Penny>然后我跟莱纳德住这里
<2-19,Penny>and we will live here?

78
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,240
<2-20,Sheldon>有意思
<2-20,Sheldon>Interesting.

79
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,300
<2-20,Sheldon>如果我把寝宫移到了对门
<2-20,Sheldon>If my official residence were across the hall,

80
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,700
<2-20,Sheldon>那我回来这里需不需要敲门呢
<2-20,Sheldon>I wonder if I'd need to knock every time I came over here.

81
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,600
<2-21,Leonard>这是个好问题
<2-21,Leonard>That's a good question.

82
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,740
<2-21,Leonard>要不你就干脆别回来了
<2-21,Leonard>Maybe just don't come over.

83
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,560
<2-22,Sheldon>从过去经验来看  我很不适应改变
<2-22,Sheldon>Historically, I don't do well with change.

84
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,730
<2-23,Penny>也不会有那么糟啦
<2-23,Penny>Okay, it won't be that bad.

85
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,920
<2-23,Penny>你不在的时候  我们也不会去坐你的专座
<2-23,Penny>We wouldn't even sit in your spot while you're gone.

86
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,320
<2-24,Sheldon>大胆刁民  你当然不敢
<2-24,Sheldon>You're darn right, you wouldn't.

87
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,860
<2-24,Sheldon>无论我在哪里  这里永远都是我的专座
<2-24,Sheldon>No matter where I am, this will always be my spot.

88
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,790
<2-24,Sheldon>就像是那些外国大使馆
<2-24,Sheldon>Like an embassy in a foreign country,

89
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,520
<2-24,Sheldon>这座位永远是我屁股不可分割的一部分
<2-24,Sheldon>this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,580
<2-25,Leonard>就点头陪笑就对了  他就要走了
<2-25,Leonard>Just nod and smile. He's almost gone.

91
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,650
<2-26,Amy>谢尔顿  你觉得呢
<2-26,Amy>Sheldon, what do you think?

92
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,820
<2-27,Sheldon>好吧  我同意
<2-27,Sheldon>Very well. I'm on board.

93
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,140
<2-28,Amy>-真的吗  -真的
<2-28,Amy>- Seriously? - Yes.

94
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,830
<2-29,Sheldon>我接受这个五周的任务
<2-29,Sheldon>I accept this five-week mission

95
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,830
<2-29,Sheldon>跟我的女朋友分享同一居住空间
<2-29,Sheldon>to share a living space with my girlfriend.

96
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,250
<2-30,Amy>好兴奋啊
<2-30,Amy>Oh. This is so exciting.

97
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,210
<2-31,Sheldon>但跟《原初系列》一样
<2-31,Sheldon>Well, now, don't be surprised if, like Star Trek,

98
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,730
<2-31,Sheldon>三季就砍的话  也别太惊讶
<2-31,Sheldon>it's canceled in three.

99
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,580
<3-1,Raj>不得不说  我对你的妇产科医生挺满意
<3-1,Raj>I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,760
<3-2,Howard>那就好  因为那医生也很满意
<3-2,Howard>Cool. 'Cause she says you're doing a great job as

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,300
<3-2,Howard>你这位"明明不用每次都跟来的怪朋友"
<3-2,Howard>"Weird friend who doesn't have to be at every appointment."

102
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,130
<3-3,Raj>我父亲是一名妇科医生  我能帮得上忙嘛
<3-3,Raj>I'm the son of a gynecologist. I could be helpful.

103
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,550
<3-4,Bernadette>你想帮忙的话就不要跟我说
<3-4,Bernadette>It would help if you stopped telling me

104
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,660
<3-4,Bernadette>我的子宫颈长得很标准了
<3-4,Bernadette>I have a textbook cervix.

105
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,890
<3-5,Raj>有礼貌的回答应该是"谢谢你注意到"
<3-5,Raj>The polite response is, "Thank you for noticing."

106
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,930
<3-6,Bernadette>再让我看一次B超图
<3-6,Bernadette>Let me see the sonogram again.

107
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,560
<3-6,Bernadette>这个小灰团看起来就是一个漂亮宝宝
<3-6,Bernadette>Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking baby for a little gray blob.

108
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,490
<3-7,Howard>我们可以给他取名团仔
<3-7,Howard>Yeah, we could name him Blobert.

109
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,240
<3-8,Bernadette>如果是女孩怎么办
<3-8,Bernadette>What if it's a girl?

110
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,000
<3-9,Howard>灰灰
<3-9,Howard>Bloberta.

111
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,690
<3-9,Howard>或者是灰妞
<3-9,Howard>Or Blobbi with an "I."

112
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,820
<3-10,Bernadette>我们不问性别是不是太傻了
<3-10,Bernadette>Are we being silly not finding out the sex?

113
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,410
<3-11,Howard>我也正在想这事呢
<3-11,Howard>Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.

114
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,370
<3-12,Raj>如果你们愿意  你们现在就能知道
<3-12,Raj>If you want, you can find out right now.

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,800
<3-14,Bernadette>医生今天已经下班了  算了
<3-14,Bernadette>The doctor's gone for the day, so it doesn't matter.

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,010
<3-15,Raj>有人可是在档案里看到了哦
<3-15,Raj>Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.

117
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,460
<3-16,Bernadette>你偷看了我们的档案吗
<3-16,Bernadette>You looked in our folder?!

118
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,900
<3-17,Raj>我不小心看到的
<3-17,Raj>It was an accident.

119
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,830
<3-17,Raj>医生就这样随随便便把档案放在她桌子上
<3-17,Raj>The doctor left the folder out on her desk.

120
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,870
<3-17,Raj>于是我就看了  怪我咯
<3-17,Raj>It's not my fault I opened it and looked.

121
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,280
<3-18,Howard>所以你知道孩子的性别  我们却一无所知
<3-18,Howard>So you know the sex of our baby, and we don't?!

122
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,300
<3-19,Raj>你们可以投硬币  猜对的机会高达5成
<3-19,Raj>Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.

123
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,050
<3-21,Bernadette>-真不敢相信  -你妹的  拉杰
<3-21,Bernadette>- It's unbelievable. - God, Raj.

124
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,790
<3-22,Raj>咋了  这又不是什么问题
<3-22,Raj>What? This is not a problem, okay?

125
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,880
<3-22,Raj>你们如果不想知道  我不告诉你们就好啦
<3-22,Raj>If you don't want to know, I don't have to tell you.

126
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,950
<3-23,Bernadette>我们不想让你知道
<3-23,Bernadette>We don't want you to know!

127
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,230
<3-24,Raj>好吧  这就的确是个问题
<3-24,Raj>Okay, well, that's a problem.

128
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,030
<4-1,Penny>你愿意尝试和艾米同居  我可为你自豪了
<4-1,Penny>You know, I'm very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.

129
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,480
<4-2,Sheldon>谢谢
<4-2,Sheldon>Oh. Thank you.

130
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,060
<4-4,Sheldon>其实最理想方式是
<4-4,Sheldon>Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment

131
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,420
<4-4,Sheldon>使用四组完全一样的谢尔顿和艾米来做实验
<4-4,Sheldon>would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys.

132
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,180
<4-4,Sheldon>第一组不是恋爱关系  也不同居
<4-4,Sheldon>One pair that was neither dating nor living together.

133
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,610
<4-4,Sheldon>第二组是恋爱关系  但不同居
<4-4,Sheldon>One pair that was dating but not living together.

134
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,340
<4-4,Sheldon>第三组同居  但不是恋爱关系
<4-4,Sheldon>One pair that was living together but not dating.

135
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,270
<4-4,Sheldon>最后  第四组
<4-4,Sheldon>And then, of course, one pair

136
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,240
<4-4,Sheldon>既是恋爱关系又同居在一起
<4-4,Sheldon>that was living together and dating.

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,540
<4-4,Sheldon>不过  如果真有这么多的谢尔顿
<4-4,Sheldon>Although, with that many Sheldons,

138
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,990
<4-4,Sheldon>大家早就玩得忘乎所以  忘掉实验的事了
<4-4,Sheldon>it'd be such a party, we'd never get anything done.

139
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,050
<4-5,Penny>真是个萌萌的小故事啊
<4-5,Penny>That was a cute story.

140
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,840
<4-5,Penny>那个...
<4-5,Penny>So, um...

141
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,350
<4-5,Penny>你之前想问我什么来着
<4-5,Penny>What did you want to ask me?

142
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,660
<4-6,Sheldon>你有过和恋人同居的经验
<4-6,Sheldon>Well, you've lived with your significant other for some time.

143
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,900
<4-6,Sheldon>我希望这次实验可以顺利进行
<4-6,Sheldon>I would like this experiment to go well.

144
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,530
<4-6,Sheldon>你有什么好建议吗
<4-6,Sheldon>Are there any insights you can share?

145
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,950
<4-7,Penny>最重要的一点  如果她的室友是个疯子
<4-7,Penny>Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate,

146
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,170
<4-7,Penny>不要犹豫  立刻把那室友扫地出门
<4-7,Penny>kick him out as soon as possible.

147
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,280
<4-8,Sheldon>在你出现之前  莱纳德和我可幸福美满了
<4-8,Sheldon>You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.

148
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,860
<5-1,Amy>你和谢尔顿做了这么久的室友
<5-1,Amy>You've been roommates with Sheldon forever.

149
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,870
<5-1,Amy>有什么经验之谈吗
<5-1,Amy>Do you have any advice?

150
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,420
<5-2,Leonard>我正努力寻找一个
<5-2,Leonard>I'm trying to think of an answer

151
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,810
<5-2,Leonard>不会让你不敢搬进来的答案
<5-2,Leonard>that won't stop you from doing this.

152
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,190
<5-3,Penny>虽然这是老生常谈了
<5-3,Penny>I know it sounds like a cliche

153
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,650
<5-3,Penny>但退一步真的会海阔天空
<5-3,Penny>but compromise is key.

154
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,560
<5-4,Leonard>不要把皮带留在地板上
<5-4,Leonard>Never leave a belt on the floor.

155
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,850
<5-4,Leonard>在晚上看起来特别像蛇
<5-4,Leonard>At night, they look like snakes.

156
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,830
<5-5,Penny>从小事做起  早上把咖啡送到她床上去
<5-5,Penny>Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.

157
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,320
<5-6,Leonard>口袋里时刻备有巧克力豆
<5-6,Leonard>Keep M&M'S in your pocket

158
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,730
<5-6,Leonard>以防你们俩遇到排长队的时候
<5-6,Leonard>in case you have to wait in a long line.

159
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,480
<5-7,Penny>你们每天都要见好多次面
<5-7,Penny>You're gonna be seeing each other a lot,

160
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,830
<5-7,Penny>所以要尊重各自的私人空间
<5-7,Penny>so respect each other's personal space.

161
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,560
<5-8,Leonard>他特别容易受惊吓  照相千万别开闪光灯
<5-8,Leonard>He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.

162
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,210
<6-1,Sheldon>你这次带了几条内裤
<6-1,Sheldon>How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?

163
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,310
<6-2,Amy>我不知道  我没数
<6-2,Amy>I don't know. I didn't count.

164
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,940
<6-3,Sheldon>真是白面秀才遇上了邋遢兵
<6-3,Sheldon>You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.

165
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,290
<6-4,Amy>对  兵是我  听我说
<6-4,Amy>That's me.  Listen,

166
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,110
<6-4,Amy>你和我要睡在一张床上了
<6-4,Amy>you and I are gonna be sharing a bed.

167
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,000
<6-4,Amy>这件事对于我俩都是头一次
<6-4,Amy>You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,250
<6-4,Amy>你对此有何感想
<6-4,Amy>How are you feeling about that?

169
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,760
<6-5,Sheldon>非常兴奋  有些疑虑
<6-5,Sheldon>Oh, excited, concerned,

170
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,900
<6-5,Sheldon>还有点害怕
<6-5,Sheldon>a little scared.

171
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,500
<6-5,Sheldon>就跟我在迪斯尼太空山排队时的心情一模一样
<6-5,Sheldon>All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.

172
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,140
<6-6,Amy>如果你是为睡觉的问题而困扰的话
<6-6,Amy>Well, if you're nervous about the sleeping arrangements,

173
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,400
<6-6,Amy>也许我们应该好好谈一谈
<6-6,Amy>maybe we should talk about it.

174
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,710
<6-7,Sheldon>好呀
<6-7,Sheldon>Okay.

175
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,410
<6-7,Sheldon>谈吧
<6-7,Sheldon>Talk.

176
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,890
<6-8,Amy>我猜你的疑虑之一
<6-8,Amy>Well, I imagine one of your concerns

177
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,130
<6-8,Amy>应该是担心会需要做爱吧
<6-8,Amy>might be coital expectations.

178
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,120
<6-9,Sheldon>也不来点前戏  直捣黄龙啊
<6-9,Sheldon>Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.

179
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,580
<6-10,Amy>我明白这次实验对你来说是
<6-10,Amy>Look, I know this experiment

180
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,280
<6-10,Amy>迈出舒适圈的一大步
<6-10,Amy>is a big step outside of your comfort zone.

181
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,830
<6-10,Amy>所以我们不如先暂缓发生性关系
<6-10,Amy>So why don't we take being physical off the table

182
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,390
<6-10,Amy>留到后面
<6-10,Amy>and maybe later on,

183
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,920
<6-10,Amy>等彼此适应下来  再提这个话题
<6-10,Amy>once we're more settled in, we can revisit it.

184
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,360
<6-11,Sheldon>你对此真的没意见吗
<6-11,Sheldon>You're really okay with that?

185
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,990
<6-12,Amy>我也从来没和别人同居过
<6-12,Amy>I've never lived with someone, either.

186
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,180
<6-12,Amy>这对我来说也是大挑战
<6-12,Amy>This is a lot for me, too.

187
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,060
<6-13,Sheldon>听你这么说我心里就轻松了
<6-13,Sheldon>This is such a relief.

188
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,510
<6-13,Sheldon>说真的  要不是怕你会欲火焚身
<6-13,Sheldon>Honestly, if it didn't get you all worked up,

189
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,580
<6-13,Sheldon>我都想吻你来谢你
<6-13,Sheldon>I'd kiss you right now.

190
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,020
<6-13,Sheldon>好决定
<6-13,Sheldon>Good call.

191
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,490
<6-14,Amy>在看到你的《少年泰坦》卡通内裤后
<6-14,Amy>Seeing your Teen Titans underwear

192
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,580
<6-14,Amy>我的确是"性致高昂"
<6-14,Amy>really got my motor running.

193
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,510
<6-15,Sheldon>我懂你  这种产品就不该卖给孩子
<6-15,Sheldon>I know. They probably shouldn't sell those to children.

194
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,560
<7-1,Penny>钥匙给你
<7-1,Penny>Well, here's your key.

195
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,860
<7-2,Amy>谢谢
<7-2,Amy>Thank you.

196
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,200
<7-3,Sheldon>好好享受公寓里二人世界吧
<7-3,Sheldon>Enjoy having the place to yourselves.

197
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,870
<7-4,Leonard>你们也好好享受
<7-4,Leonard>You enjoy your mission to boldly go

198
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,530
<7-4,Leonard>这段从未有人涉足过的伟大任务吧
<7-4,Leonard>where no man has gone before.

199
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,550
<7-5,Sheldon>那是佩妮的卧室
<7-5,Sheldon>It's Penny's bedroom.

200
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,420
<7-5,Sheldon>涉足其中的男人数不胜数
<7-5,Sheldon>Plenty of men have gone before.

201
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,810
<7-6,Penny>好了好了  不要搞得这么情绪化
<7-6,Penny>Now, now, there's no need to make this emotional.

202
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,350
<7-7,Amy>我们走吧
<7-7,Amy>Shall we?

203
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,940
<7-8,Sheldon>看来要就此别过了
<7-8,Sheldon>I guess this is it.

204
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,100
<7-9,Leonard>祝你们住得高兴
<7-9,Leonard>You guys have fun.

205
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,540
<7-10,Sheldon>你也是
<7-10,Sheldon>You, too.

206
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,790
<7-10,Sheldon>别忘了
<7-10,Sheldon>Oh, don't forget.

207
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,750
<7-10,Sheldon>周二得换空气净化器滤网
<7-10,Sheldon>Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.

208
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,350
<7-11,Penny>记得  你已经写我手上了
<7-11,Penny>Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.

209
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,110
<7-12,Sheldon>还有每隔一天
<7-12,Sheldon>Oh, and every other day,

210
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,050
<7-12,Sheldon>检查牛油果盆栽的水位
<7-12,Sheldon>check the water level on the avocado pit.

211
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,740
<7-13,Leonard>我来负责
<7-13,Leonard>I'm on it.

212
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,770
<7-13,Leonard>十五年后  我们可以一起做牛油果酱
<7-13,Leonard>15 years from now, we'll make guacamole together.

213
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,610
<7-14,Sheldon>莱纳德  别撩我让我走
<7-14,Sheldon>Leonard, please, let me go.

214
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,080
<7-15,Amy>走了  谢尔顿
<7-15,Amy>Come on, Sheldon.

215
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,880
<7-16,Sheldon>再见
<7-16,Sheldon>Oh. Bye.

216
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,180
<7-17,Leonard>-晚安  -晚安
<7-17,Leonard>- Good night. - Good night.

217
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,260
<7-18,Penny>就这样
<7-18,Penny>Well, that's it.

218
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,190
<7-19,Amy>接下来的五个星期里  我们要正式同居
<7-19,Amy>For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.

219
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,780
<7-20,Sheldon>实验就此开始
<7-20,Sheldon>I guess the experiment begins.

220
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,120
<7-21,Penny (off, screaming)>-我们成功了  -好棒
<7-21,Penny (off, screaming)>- We did it! - Yeah!

221
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,050
<8-1,Sheldon>你比较想睡在床的哪一侧
<8-1,Sheldon>Which side of the bed would you prefer?

222
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,780
<8-2,Amy>我无所谓  你选吧
<8-2,Amy>Doesn't matter to me. Your choice.

223
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,890
<8-3,Sheldon>不行不行  我们现在同居了  一切平等
<8-3,Sheldon>No, no, we're living together now-- everything's equal.

224
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,940
<8-3,Sheldon>其实我知道我的控制欲稍强一点
<8-3,Sheldon>You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling,

225
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,830
<8-3,Sheldon>所以我希望由你来选择
<8-3,Sheldon>so I would rather you choose.

226
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,430
<8-4,Amy>谢尔顿  你的好意我心领了
<8-4,Amy>Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that,

227
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,240
<8-4,Amy>但这些事对你来说更为重要
<8-4,Amy>but these things mean more to you than they do to me,

228
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,760
<8-4,Amy>所以你想怎样都行
<8-4,Amy>so whatever you want.

229
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,650
<8-5,Sheldon>这明显就不是我想怎样都行
<8-5,Sheldon>Well, clearly, it's not whatever I want,

230
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,500
<8-5,Sheldon>因为我想要你来做选择
<8-5,Sheldon>because what I want is for you to make this decision,

231
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,270
<8-5,Sheldon>而你拒绝了
<8-5,Sheldon>and you refuse to do that.

232
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,280
<8-6,Amy>我不是拒绝
<8-6,Amy>Well, I'm not refusing.

233
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,920
<8-6,Amy>只是想考虑周全而已
<8-6,Amy>I'm just trying to be considerate.

234
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,460
<8-7,Sheldon>就像你叫我买那双
<8-7,Sheldon>Like when you let me get those shoes

235
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,400
<8-7,Sheldon>鞋底带着轮子的鞋
<8-7,Sheldon>with the wheels on the bottom,

236
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,740
<8-7,Sheldon>然后眼睁睁看着我滚入车流之中吗
<8-7,Sheldon>and then watched me roll right into traffic?

237
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,490
<8-8,Amy>-谢尔顿  你就赶紧选行不行  -好吧
<8-8,Amy>- Sheldon, will you please just pick a side? - Fine.

238
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,170
<8-9,Sheldon>好的  在这一侧
<8-9,Sheldon>Okay. Now, on this side,

239
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,750
<8-9,Sheldon>一旦发生意外  我离出口更近
<8-9,Sheldon>I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.

240
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
<8-10,Amy>很好  你就睡这侧
<8-10,Amy>Great. That's your side.

241
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,010
<8-11,Sheldon>可一旦有人进屋袭击  我离他也更近
<8-11,Sheldon>No, but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack.

242
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,750
<8-12,Amy>行  那我就睡那侧
<8-12,Amy>Okay, I'll take that side.

243
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,510
<8-13,Sheldon>可话说回来  有人来袭击的几率又能有多大
<8-13,Sheldon>Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?

244
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,350
<8-14,Amy>急速增长中
<8-14,Amy>Rising rapidly.

245
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,920
<8-15,Sheldon>而在这一侧  方便我去卫生间
<8-15,Sheldon>Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom,

246
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,880
<8-15,Sheldon>但也离窗户较近
<8-15,Sheldon>but I am closer to the window

247
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,670
<8-15,Sheldon>怪叔叔可以偷看我睡觉觉
<8-15,Sheldon>where perverts can watch me sleep.

248
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,480
<8-15,Sheldon>好的
<8-15,Sheldon>Okay.

249
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,020
<8-16,Amy>那这样有没有好点
<8-16,Amy>What if we do this?

250
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,870
<8-17,Sheldon>这样也行
<8-17,Sheldon>I suppose that works.

251
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,950
<8-18,Amy>很好
<8-18,Amy>Great.

252
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,230
<8-19,Sheldon>不过我现在开始担心有人藏在窗帘后面了
<8-19,Sheldon>Although now I'm kind of worried someone's hiding behind those drapes.

253
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
<9-1,Bernadette>这太荒谬了
<9-1,Bernadette>This is ridiculous.

254
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,300
<9-1,Bernadette>医生知道孩子的性别
<9-1,Bernadette>The doctor knows what the baby is,

255
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,790
<9-1,Bernadette>超声波的技术人员知道  拉杰知道
<9-1,Bernadette>the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows,

256
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,050
<9-1,Bernadette>他在的《实习医生格蕾》线上粉丝群友可能也知道
<9-1,Bernadette>his Grey's Anatomy online fan group probably knows.

257
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,330
<9-1,Bernadette>我们不知道会不会很奇怪
<9-1,Bernadette>Is it weird we don't?

258
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,900
<9-1,Bernadette>不知道
<9-1,Bernadette>I don't know.

259
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,360
<9-2,Howard>也许最后的惊喜会让它更有意思
<9-2,Howard>Maybe the surprise will make it more fun.

260
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,960
<9-2,Howard>就像魔术一样
<9-2,Howard>Like magic tricks.

261
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,730
<9-2,Howard>还记得我跟你揭秘了无穷尽手帕魔术时
<9-2,Howard>Remember how disappointed you were

262
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,940
<9-2,Howard>你当时有多失望吗
<9-2,Howard>when I explained the never-ending hanky?

263
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,530
<9-3,Bernadette>我失望的是看到我要嫁的男人
<9-3,Bernadette>I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to

264
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,590
<9-3,Bernadette>从他的裤门里拽出一长条彩虹丝巾
<9-3,Bernadette>pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.

265
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,620
<9-4,Howard>可你当时明明很高兴看到
<9-4,Howard>But how delightful was it when I pulled out

266
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,080
<9-4,Howard>丝巾最尾端连着的那束花啊
<9-4,Howard>a bouquet at the end of those scarves?

267
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,440
<9-4,Howard>所以等医生
<9-4,Howard>It'll be the same thing

268
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,980
<9-4,Howard>从你身体里拽出来个惊喜时  也是一样的
<9-4,Howard>when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.

269
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,050
<9-5,Bernadette>所有人都说我插牛粪上了
<9-5,Bernadette>Everyone said I could do better.

270
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,960
<9-6,Howard>可你没听劝  转眼间
<9-6,Howard>But you didn't listen, and presto change-o,

271
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,330
<9-6,Howard>你怀上了小牛粪
<9-6,Howard>my baby's inside you. Ta-da!

272
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,530
<10-1,Amy (off)>那是什么玩意儿
<10-1,Amy (off)>Ugh. What is that?

273
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,300
<10-1,Amy (off)>你为什么换边了
<10-1,Amy (off)>Why'd you switch sides?

274
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,600
<10-2,Sheldon>本皇没落跑  你就跪谢吧
<10-2,Sheldon>Be grateful I'm still in the room.

275
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,910
<10-3,Amy>舒服吗
<10-3,Amy>Comfy?

276
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,810
<10-4,Sheldon>我很开心我不知道
<10-4,Sheldon>Oh, I'm just happy I don't know

277
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,160
<10-4,Sheldon>这些记忆海绵记忆过哪些"姿势"
<10-4,Sheldon>what this memory foam remembers.

278
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,250
<10-4,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<10-4,Sheldon>Sheldon?

279
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,410
<10-5,Amy>我知道我们说好了不交媾
<10-5,Amy>I know we took coitus off the table,

280
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,560
<10-5,Amy>但我想知道你怎么看待其他形式的亲密
<10-5,Amy>but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy,

281
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,210
<10-5,Amy>比如依偎睡觉
<10-5,Amy>such as snuggling.

282
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,830
<10-6,Sheldon>这个问题问得好
<10-6,Sheldon>Well, it's funny you should ask,

283
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,320
<10-6,Sheldon>因为我刚才还在琢磨
<10-6,Sheldon>because I was wondering how you'd feel

284
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,730
<10-6,Sheldon>你怎么看待用枕头墙把咱俩隔开这个主意
<10-6,Sheldon>about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.

285
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,250
<10-7,Amy>谢尔顿  我为你已经做出很多改变了
<10-7,Amy>Sheldon, I've made more than enough accommodations for you.

286
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,540
<10-7,Amy>我们都是大人了
<10-7,Amy>We're both grown adults--

287
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,910
<10-7,Amy>曾经也有过比这更亲密的举动
<10-7,Amy>we've been far more intimate than this.

288
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,250
<10-7,Amy>如果你不想依偎着睡  没问题
<10-7,Amy>If you don't want to snuggle, fine--

289
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,690
<10-7,Amy>但我不会搭一堵枕头墙的
<10-7,Amy>but we're not building a pillow wall.

290
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,350
<10-8,Sheldon>好啦  我道歉
<10-8,Sheldon>Okay, well, I am sorry.

291
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,860
<10-8,Sheldon>我只是担心我对温度的敏感
<10-8,Sheldon>I'm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature

292
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,540
<10-8,Sheldon>会让今夜很难熬
<10-8,Sheldon>could make this a rough night.

293
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,900
<10-8,Sheldon>没有恶意  可你屁股辐射出的热度
<10-8,Sheldon>And no offense, but your bottom radiates enough heat,

294
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,760
<10-8,Sheldon>不禁让我纳闷怎么美洲鬣蜥还没来取暖
<10-8,Sheldon>I'm surprised there aren't iguanas lying on it.

295
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,040
<11-1,Leonard>到点了  谢尔顿睡觉时间到
<11-1,Leonard>That's it. It's Sheldon's bedtime.

296
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,870
<11-1,Leonard>他今晚在那睡定了
<11-1,Leonard>He is in for the night.

297
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,940
<11-2,Penny>不敢相信  我们的公寓里就剩我们俩了
<11-2,Penny>Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.

298
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,240
<11-2,Penny>感觉很奇怪
<11-2,Penny>It's weird.

299
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,370
<11-3,Leonard>孩子们离家去上大学后
<11-3,Leonard>This must be how parents feel

300
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,620
<11-3,Leonard>家长肯定就是这种感觉
<11-3,Leonard>when their kid goes off to college.

301
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,620
<11-3,Leonard>但如果家长觉得难过那就另当别论了
<11-3,Leonard>Unless they feel sad-- then it's different.

302
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,040
<11-4,Penny>你想做什么
<11-4,Penny>So, what do you want to do?

303
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,830
<11-5,Leonard>我太清楚我们要做什么了
<11-5,Leonard>I know exactly what we are gonna do.

304
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,150
<11-6,Penny>不是吧  你是天才
<11-6,Penny>Really? You're a genius,

305
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,480
<11-6,Penny>想到的第一件事就是这个吗
<11-6,Penny>and that's the first thing you come up with?

306
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,410
<11-7,Leonard>谢尔顿不在
<11-7,Leonard>Hey, Sheldon's not here,

307
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,360
<11-7,Leonard>所以我们要来点音乐嗨起来
<11-7,Leonard>so we are going to put on music

308
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,730
<11-7,Leonard>穿着内裤舞起来
<11-7,Leonard>and dance in our underwear.

309
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,440
<11-8,Penny>好恶  直接做爱行吗
<11-8,Penny>Ugh. Can we just have sex?

310
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,370
<11-9,Leonard>别担心
<11-9,Leonard>Oh, don't worry.

311
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,120
<11-9,Leonard>你见识我的曼妙舞姿后  一定会想扑倒我
<11-9,Leonard>Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.

312
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,120
<11-10,Penny>你说"一定会扑倒"是吗
<11-10,Penny>Inevitable, you say?

313
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,250
<11-11,Leonard>我让我的屁屁来回答你好了
<11-11,Leonard>I'll just let my hips do the talkin'.

314
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,270
<12-1,Howard>不管了  我要打电话问清楚
<12-1,Howard>Screw it. I'm calling and finding out.

315
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,870
<12-2,Bernadette>好  打给他
<12-2,Bernadette>Good. Call him.

316
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,400
<12-2,Bernadette>慢着  我不确定我想知道
<12-2,Bernadette>Wait, I'm not sure I want to know.

317
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,820
<12-3,Howard>但你刚说了你想知道
<12-3,Howard>But you just said you wanted to know.

318
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,100
<12-4,Bernadette>现在我不知道我是否想知道
<12-4,Bernadette>Well, now I don't know if I want to know!

319
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,300
<12-5,Raj>喂
<12-5,Raj>Hello?

320
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,610
<12-6,Howard>再打给你
<12-6,Howard>Call you back.

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,580
<12-6,Howard>不  费曼博士
<12-6,Howard>No, Dr. Feynman.

322
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,240
<13-1,Sheldon>如果我帮你解决了  你怎么能学习呢
<13-1,Sheldon>If I solve it for you, you'll never learn.

323
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,690
<13-1,Sheldon>你在哪里学会的这些舞步啊
<13-1,Sheldon>Wow! Where did you learn these moves?

324
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,180
<14-1,Penny>这个世界也许已经遗忘了跳舞机
<14-1,Penny>The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution,

325
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,710
<14-2,Leonard>但这个"犯罪高手"可没忘
<14-2,Leonard>but not this smooth criminal.

326
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,710
<14-2,Leonard>迈克尔·杰克逊名曲

<16-1,Penny>我跟你说了不要跳虫爬式[霹雳舞经典动作]
<16-1,Penny>I told you not to do the worm.

333
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,530
<16-2,Leonard>你是对的
<16-2,Leonard>You were right.

<16-2,Leonard>-你在地上做什么  -稍等
<16-2,Leonard>- What are you doing down there? - Hang on.

337
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,680
<16-2,Leonard>你在打电话给谁
<16-2,Leonard>Who are you calling?

338
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,700
<16-2,Leonard>我浑身酸痛
<16-2,Leonard>I'm so sore.

339
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,490
<16-2,Leonard>我想我昨晚没睡超过两分钟
<16-2,Leonard>I don't think I slept two minutes last night.

340
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,200
<19-1,Amy>爽啊  姐妹
<19-1,Amy>Yeah, get it, girl.

341
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,130
<19-2,Penny>不是你想的那样
<19-2,Penny>It's not what you think.

342
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,720
<19-3,Amy>我觉得我拉伤了
<19-3,Amy>I feel like I pulled something.

343
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,010
<19-4,Leonard>你为什么不叫我停下呢
<19-4,Leonard>Why didn't you tell me to stop?

344
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,230
<19-5,Penny>更加不是你想的那样
<19-5,Penny>Even more not what you think.

345
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,330
<19-6,Amy>我不知道能否熬过和他一起住五周时间
<19-6,Amy>I don't know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.

<19-9,Sheldon>早上好
<19-9,Sheldon>Good morning.

349
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,270
<19-9,Sheldon>看  我没敲门  不过没关系
<19-9,Sheldon>See? I didn't knock, but it's fine.

350
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,520
<19-9,Sheldon>我没敲门不过没关系  我没敲门不过没关系
<19-9,Sheldon>I didn't knock, but it's fine. I didn't knock, but it's fine.

351
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,650
<19-9,Sheldon>大家还好吗
<19-9,Sheldon>So, how is everyone?

352
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,590
<19-10,Amy>苦不堪言  精疲力尽
<19-10,Amy>Miserable and exhausted.

353
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,260
<19-11,Sheldon>是吗  我睡得可香了
<19-11,Sheldon>Really? I slept great.

354
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,630
<19-12,Amy>我没睡好  都怪你
<19-12,Amy>Well, I didn't, and it's your fault.

355
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,160
<19-13,Sheldon>这话怎么说  整个地板不都归你了吗
<19-13,Sheldon>How? You had the whole floor to yourself.

356
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,670
<19-14,Amy>谢尔顿  也许同居不是个好主意
<19-14,Amy>Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.

357
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,190
<19-15,Sheldon>仅仅凭12小时的数据就得出结论
<19-15,Sheldon>Well... Yeah, but what kind of scientists would we be,

358
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,960
<19-15,Sheldon>我们算是哪门子的科学家
<19-15,Sheldon>drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?

359
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,290
<19-16,Amy>昨晚差点用枕头闷死你的那种
<19-16,Amy>The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.

360
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,820
<19-17,Sheldon>我就知道我们间会出现问题
<19-17,Sheldon>I anticipated we'd have problems,

361
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,150
<19-17,Sheldon>但我真没想到你的科学严谨性会是其中之一
<19-17,Sheldon>but I never thought your scientific rigor would be one of them.

362
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,370
<19-18,Amy>打断下  你是在质疑我作为科学家的诚信吗
<19-18,Amy>I'm sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?

363
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,510
<19-19,Sheldon>实验室的一次性鞋套合脚吗
<19-19,Sheldon>If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.

364
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,440
<19-20,Penny>这算是科学版撕逼吗
<19-20,Penny>Was that a science diss?

365
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,640
<19-22,Penny>-对  -这句撕得狠吗
<19-22,Penny>- Yeah. - Was it a good one?

366
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,560
<19-25,Amy>一个理论物理学家
<19-25,Amy>What would a theoretical physicist

367
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,740
<19-25,Amy>懂个屁的实验啊
<19-25,Amy>understand about an experiment anyway?

368
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,520
<19-25,Amy>就算混杂和变量同时扇你耳光
<19-25,Amy>I mean, you wouldn't know a confounding variable

369
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,230
<19-25,Amy>你都不会感觉到混杂变量
<19-25,Amy>if two of them hit you in the face at the same time!

370
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,260
<19-25,Amy>而且你根本听不懂笑点在哪里
<19-25,Amy>And you don't even get that joke,

371
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,140
<19-25,Amy>因为你根本没和混杂变量打过交道
<19-25,Amy>'cause you don't even work with confounding variables!

372
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,860
<19-26,Sheldon>你胆子够大的
<19-26,Sheldon>How dare you?

373
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,730
<19-27,Amy>我说了又怎么样
<19-27,Amy>Oh, you heard me.

374
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,230
<19-27,Amy>你的实验诚信度就是个笑话
<19-27,Amy>Your experimental bona fides are laughable.

375
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,110
<19-28,Sheldon>你居然敢取笑我的诚信度
<19-28,Sheldon>Whoa, whoa! Now you're making fun of my bona fides?

376
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,770
<19-29,Amy>是空集的东西要如何取笑
<19-29,Amy>Can't make fun of something that's a null set.

377
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,920
<19-30,Penny>-我感觉这句适合喊个"厉害"  -喊吧
<19-30,Penny>- I feel like I should say "Damn." - Do it.

378
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,810
<19-32,Penny>厉害
<19-32,Penny>Damn!

379
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,470
<19-33,Sheldon>如果你对科学方法的保护欲这么强
<19-33,Sheldon>Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method,

380
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,240
<19-33,Sheldon>也许我们应该用接下来五周时间
<19-33,Sheldon>perhaps we should use the next five weeks

381
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,430
<19-33,Sheldon>做完我们已经开始做的事
<19-33,Sheldon>to finish what we started.

382
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,440
<19-34,Amy>为了科学  也许我愿意
<19-34,Amy>Well, for science, maybe I will!

383
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,960
<19-35,Sheldon>为了科学  也许你应该这样做
<19-35,Sheldon>For science, maybe you should!

384
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,710
<19-36,Amy>-行  -行
<19-36,Amy>- Fine! - Fine!

385
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,300
<19-39,Sheldon>-很好  -好极了
<19-39,Sheldon>- Good. - Great.

386
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,620
<19-40,Amy>你想回我们公寓亲热吗
<19-40,Amy>Do you want to go to our place and make out?

387
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,350
<19-41,Sheldon>史蒂芬·霍金是坐电动轮椅溜达的吗
<19-41,Sheldon>Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?

388
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,520
<19-42,Penny>新邻居真是怪人
<19-42,Penny>The new neighbors are weird.
