20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,950
<1-10,Sheldon>提醒大家  我们说旗帜"背后"
<1-10,Sheldon>Mind you, when we say behind the flags

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,390
<1-10,Sheldon>不是指这两面旗帜的背后
<1-10,Sheldon>we don't literally mean these flags.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,520
<1-10,Sheldon>它们背后是我们的餐桌
<1-10,Sheldon>That's just where we have dinner.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,940
<1-11,Amy>好了  我相信你们很多人都好奇
<1-11,Amy>Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering

24
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,950
<1-11,Amy>《有趣的旗帜》是如何开始的
<1-11,Amy>how Fun with Flags began.

25
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,170
<1-12,Sheldon>让我们听听见证我们节目开始的
<1-12,Sheldon>So let's hear from some people who were there

26
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,620
<1-12,Sheldon>老朋友们怎么说
<1-12,Sheldon>at the very start.

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,300
<1-12,Sheldon>霍华德  记忆闪回音效
<1-12,Sheldon>H-Howard. Flashback sounds.

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,140
<1-13,Amy>明明我用竖琴也能弹
<1-13,Amy>Could have played that on my harp.

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,740
<1-14,Sheldon>你乖乖播影片就对了
<1-14,Sheldon>Just roll the clip.

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,150
<1-14,Sheldon>用你们自己的话
<1-14,Sheldon>So tell us in your own words

31
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,270
<1-14,Sheldon>告诉大家《有趣的旗帜》开始时那魔力的瞬间
<1-14,Sheldon>about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.

32
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,870
<1-15,Leonard>说真的  我记不得了
<1-15,Leonard>I honestly don't remember.

33
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,650
<1-15,Leonard>你肯定记得
<1-15,Leonard>Sure you do.

34
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,200
<1-16,Sheldon>我当时正跟你们俩说
<1-16,Sheldon>I was telling you both the story

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,770
<1-16,Sheldon>海地与列支敦士登两国
<1-16,Sheldon>about how Haiti and Lichtenstein

36
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,630
<1-16,Sheldon>是怎么发现与对方用了同样的国旗
<1-16,Sheldon>discovered they had the same flag.

37
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,210
<1-16,Sheldon>当时正值1936年的夏季奥运会
<1-16,Sheldon>It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936,

38
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,580
<1-16,Sheldon>这两个勇敢的国家
<1-16,Sheldon>and two plucky nations...

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,710
<1-17,Penny>等等  我想起来了
<1-17,Penny>Oh, wait. I remember.

40
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,730
<1-18,Sheldon>那你还记得当时对我说什么了吗
<1-18,Sheldon>Oh, and do you remember what you said?

41
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,500
<1-19,Penny>记得  拜托去找愿意鸟你的人
<1-19,Penny>Yes. Please find someone who cares.

42
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,410
<1-20,Sheldon>于是我真的这么做了
<1-20,Sheldon>And that's exactly what I did.

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,820
<1-20,Sheldon>我找到了很多愿意鸟我的人
<1-20,Sheldon>I found a lot of someones.

44
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,560
<1-21,Amy>有将近两百人呢
<1-21,Amy>Almost 200.

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,010
<1-21,Amy>很多人还是强迫中奖
<1-21,Amy>Many of them on purpose.

46
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,910
<1-22,Sheldon>现在我们要听听你们怎么说  各位观众
<1-22,Sheldon>And now we're going to turn it over to you, the viewers,

<1-27,Amy>这跟旗帜有什么关联呢
<1-27,Amy>And what does that have to do with flags?

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,210
<1-28,Bert>没关联  我就是想告诉大家我交到女朋友了
<1-28,Bert>Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,270
<1-31,Bert>她的名字叫丽贝卡
<1-31,Bert>Her name's Rebecca.

73
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,630
<2-1,Howard>我们是先去吃饭  还是在动物园里吃
<2-1,Howard>Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo?

74
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,090
<2-1,Howard>华仔  我不用吃饭
<2-1,Howard>Oh, Howie, I don't need food

75
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,470
<2-1,Howard>我玩手机就能玩饱
<2-1,Howard>as long as I can look at my phone?

76
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,260
<2-2,Bernadette>我不喜欢你模仿我
<2-2,Bernadette>I don't like when you imitate me.

77
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,480
<2-3,Howard>那你想听我模仿斯图尔特吗
<2-3,Howard>You want to hear my Stuart?

78
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,440
<2-3,Howard>我有好一阵子没跟人约会过了
<2-3,Howard>It's been a while since I've gone on a date.

79
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,820
<2-3,Howard>不介意看一下猴子交配吧
<2-3,Howard>You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?

80
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,730
<2-4,Stuart>这是我私下跟你说的好吗
<2-4,Stuart>I said that to you in confidence.

81
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,570
<2-5,Howard>这应该是我们的家庭欢乐游
<2-5,Howard>This is supposed to be our family fun day.

82
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,400
<2-5,Howard>你手机上有什么事那么重要
<2-5,Howard>What's so important on your phone?

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,130
<2-6,Bernadette>我在看托儿所的网站
<2-6,Bernadette>I'm on the day care's Web site.

84
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,480
<2-7,Howard>不用看了  那家托儿所很赞
<2-7,Howard>Stop looking at that. The day care's great.

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,630
<2-7,Howard>就在我校区里
<2-7,Howard>It's on campus.

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,290
<2-7,Howard>离我办公室就两分钟路程
<2-7,Howard>My office is two minutes away.

87
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,160
<2-7,Howard>没什么好担心的
<2-7,Howard>There's nothing to worry about.

88
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,850
<2-8,Bernadette>万一她对托儿所员工的喜爱胜过我们怎么办
<2-8,Bernadette>What if she likes the people who work there more than us?

89
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,620
<2-9,Howard>她对肥皂泡泡的喜爱已经胜过我们了
<2-9,Howard>She already likes soap bubbles more than us.

90
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,350
<2-10,Bernadette>一旦我回去工作
<2-10,Bernadette>When I go back to work,

91
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,650
<2-10,Bernadette>我们就要把她交到这些人手里
<2-10,Bernadette>we're gonna leave her with these people.

92
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,110
<2-10,Bernadette>而我们完全不了解他们
<2-10,Bernadette>We don't know anything about them.

93
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,410
<2-11,Howard>他们都是通过背景调查  训练有素的教育工作者
<2-11,Howard>They're highly-trained educators with background checks.

94
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,220
<2-11,Howard>甚至要求身上所有疫苗皆要在有效期内
<2-11,Howard>They're even required to be current on all vaccinations.

95
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,100
<2-12,Stuart>你也让我照顾她啊  可刚才说的我一样都没有
<2-12,Stuart>You leave her with me, and I'm not any of those things.

96
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,740
<3-1,Sheldon>霍华德人呢
<3-1,Sheldon>Where's Howard?

97
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,440
<3-2,Raj>他请一天假
<3-2,Raj>He took the day off.

98
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,180
<3-3,Sheldon>那我们快把握他不在的机会
<3-3,Sheldon>Oh, let's take advantage of his absence

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,640
<3-3,Sheldon>多说一点只有我们物理学家才懂的笑话
<3-3,Sheldon>and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get.

100
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,380
<3-3,Sheldon>我先来
<3-3,Sheldon>I'll go first.

101
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,350
<3-3,Sheldon>来  听好了
<3-3,Sheldon>Okay, here.

102
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,430
<3-3,Sheldon>有天德国物理学家海森堡开车被警察拦下
<3-3,Sheldon>Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer.

103
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,830
<3-3,Sheldon>警察对他说
<3-3,Sheldon>And the policeman says,

104
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,370
<3-3,Sheldon>你知道你刚才开到了时速137公里吗
<3-3,Sheldon>Did you know you were going 85 miles per hour?

105
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,690
<3-3,Sheldon>然后海森堡说
<3-3,Sheldon>And Heisenberg says,

106
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,540
<3-3,Sheldon>靠  现在我不知道我在哪里了
<3-3,Sheldon>Darn it, now I don't know where I am.

107
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,540
<3-3,Sheldon>海森堡曾提出过不确定性原理
<3-3,Sheldon>表明"粒子的位置与动量不可同时被确定"

108
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,130
<3-4,Leonard>-霍华德周一回来是吗  -对
<3-4,Leonard>- So Howard back Monday? - Yeah.

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,510
<3-6,Bert>伙计们
<3-6,Bert>Hey, guys.

110
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,090
<3-8,Leonard>-你好  -要坐下来一起吃吗
<3-8,Leonard>- Oh, hello. - Want to join us?

111
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,170
<3-9,Sheldon>可他是个地质学家  而我还有很多物理笑话要讲呢
<3-9,Sheldon>But he's a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.

112
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,160
<3-10,Raj>快请坐
<3-10,Raj>Oh, quick! Sit!

113
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,740
<3-11,Leonard>谢尔顿说你交了新的女朋友
<3-11,Leonard>So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.

114
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,540
<3-12,Sheldon>对啊  他在我旗帜节目上无礼地宣布这消息
<3-12,Sheldon>Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show.

115
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,680
<3-12,Sheldon>人们对此超级不爽的
<3-12,Sheldon>People were so upset about it

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,820
<3-12,Sheldon>以致于当晚后来再也没有人打电话进来
<3-12,Sheldon>no one else called in the rest of the night.

117
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,280
<3-13,Bert>抱歉  我克制不住自己
<3-13,Bert>Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

118
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,730
<3-13,Bert>大概我只是太爱爱情
<3-13,Bert>I guess I just love love.

119
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,640
<3-14,Raj>我为你感到由衷高兴
<3-14,Raj>Well, I'm very happy for you.

120
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,080
<3-15,Leonard>我们今晚一起吃晚餐
<3-15,Leonard>Hey, we're all having dinner tonight.

121
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,400
<3-15,Leonard>不如你们俩也加入我们吧
<3-15,Leonard>Why don't the two of you join us?

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,870
<3-16,Sheldon>是啊  等一下
<3-16,Sheldon>Yeah, wh-- Hold on.

123
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,040
<3-16,Sheldon>我们对这个女人一点都不了解
<3-16,Sheldon>We don't know anything about this woman.

124
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
<3-17,Bert>你想了解什么
<3-17,Bert>What do you want to know?

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,950
<3-18,Sheldon>她是地质学家吗
<3-18,Sheldon>Is she a geologist?

126
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,780
<3-20,Sheldon>-不是  -很好  晚上7点见
<3-20,Sheldon>- No. - Oh, great. See you at 7:00.

127
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,670
<4-1,Howard>我们看完这个就去看奇珍异鸟表演怎么样
<4-1,Howard>How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?

128
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,450
<4-2,Stuart>这主意不好
<4-2,Stuart>Not a good idea.

129
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,300
<4-2,Stuart>我的头发是鸟类梦寐以求的筑巢材料
<4-2,Stuart>My hair is a coveted nesting material.

130
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,690
<4-3,Howard>有学到什么吗
<4-3,Howard>Learning anything?

131
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,690
<4-4,Bernadette>树懒宝宝一直粘着妈妈不松手
<4-4,Bernadette>Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers' bodies

132
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,060
<4-4,Bernadette>这过程差不多有一年
<4-4,Bernadette>for almost a year.

133
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,090
<4-4,Bernadette>而我在短短的四个月后就要回去工作了
<4-4,Bernadette>I'm going back to work after only four months,

134
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,170
<4-4,Bernadette>所以我学到我恨我自己  我恨树懒
<4-4,Bernadette>so I've learned I hate myself, I hate sloths,

135
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,450
<4-4,Bernadette>我恨你把我带来这里
<4-4,Bernadette>and I hate you for bringing me here.

136
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,280
<4-5,Howard>你恨我我懂  可那只树懒还挺可爱的
<4-5,Howard>Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.

137
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,800
<4-6,Bernadette>不仅仅是树懒
<4-6,Bernadette>It's not just the sloth.

138
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,720
<4-6,Bernadette>北极熊喂养幼熊的时间也差不多有八个月
<4-6,Bernadette>Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months.

139
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,850
<4-6,Bernadette>母猩猩每天晚上都给她的宝宝弄个新窝
<4-6,Bernadette>The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night.

140
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,800
<4-6,Bernadette>而我呢
<4-6,Bernadette>And what do I do?

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,780
<4-6,Bernadette>我选择了事业  舍弃了孩子
<4-6,Bernadette>I choose my career over my child!

142
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,540
<4-7,Stuart>早跟你说我们应该去乐高乐园
<4-7,Stuart>Told you we should have gone to Legoland.

143
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,620
<5-1,Raj>真不敢相信伯特都有女朋友了  而我却没有
<5-1,Raj>Can't believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don't.

144
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,200
<5-2,Amy>我还以为你要在花丛中歇歇脚
<5-2,Amy>I thought you were taking a break from women

145
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,720
<5-2,Amy>好好专注你的事业
<5-2,Amy>to focus on your career.

146
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,250
<5-3,Raj>成熟点好吗
<5-3,Raj>Oh, grow up.

147
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,650
<5-4,Leonard>你没有朋友可以介绍给他了吗
<5-4,Leonard>Don't you have any friends he can date?

148
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,520
<5-5,Penny>我已经把伯纳黛特介绍给霍华德了
<5-5,Penny>Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette.

149
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,970
<5-5,Penny>该轮到你去毁掉某个可怜妹子的人生了
<5-5,Penny>It's your turn to ruin some poor girl's life.

150
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,120
<5-6,Raj>你们好呀  请进
<5-6,Raj>Oh, hey, guys. Come in.

151
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,330
<5-7,Bert>谢谢
<5-7,Bert>Thanks.

152
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,390
<5-7,Bert>各位
<5-7,Bert>Everyone,

153
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,300
<5-7,Bert>这位是丽贝卡
<5-7,Bert>this is Rebecca.

154
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,230
<5-9,Leonard>她不但比他年轻  长得还比他好看千百倍
<5-9,Leonard>She's younger and far more attractive than he is.

155
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,870
<5-10,Sheldon>他们俩在模仿你们俩呢
<5-10,Sheldon>They're copying you two.

156
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,700
<6-1,Howard>你在做什么
<6-1,Howard>What are you making?

157
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,070
<6-2,Stuart>鸡肉
<6-2,Stuart>Chicken.

158
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,450
<6-2,Stuart>鸟儿蹂躏我的头发  我得加倍蹂躏它们同类
<6-2,Stuart>Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard.

159
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,980
<6-3,Howard>哈雷终于睡下了吗
<6-3,Howard>Finally get Halley down?

160
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,270
<6-4,Bernadette>是的  终于
<6-4,Bernadette>Yeah, eventually.

161
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,500
<6-4,Bernadette>不过她还是很抗拒用奶瓶喝奶
<6-4,Bernadette>She's still not happy about taking a bottle, though.

162
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,450
<6-5,Howard>如果你没准备好回去上班
<6-5,Howard>Look, if you're not ready to go back to work,

163
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,890
<6-5,Howard>我们会想到解决办法的
<6-5,Howard>we'll figure something out.

164
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,670
<6-6,Bernadette>算了  我会没事的
<6-6,Bernadette>No, I'll be fine.

165
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,390
<6-7,Stuart>这对哈雷来说或许是好事
<6-7,Stuart>It might be good for her.

166
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,730
<6-7,Stuart>霍华德他妈就一直陪在他身边
<6-7,Stuart>Howard's mother was around him all the time,

167
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,300
<6-7,Stuart>结果把他惯成世界级的妈宝
<6-7,Stuart>and he's a world-class mama's boy.

168
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,220
<6-8,Howard>你为什么要这么说
<6-8,Howard>I mean, wh-why would you say that?

169
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,920
<6-9,Stuart>来啊  发脾气啊  那恰恰证明我是"错"的
<6-9,Stuart>Go ahead, have a tantrum; that'll prove me wrong.

170
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,540
<6-10,Bernadette>其实把哈雷养育成比你更独立的人
<6-10,Bernadette>It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent

171
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,080
<6-10,Bernadette>也没什么不好啊
<6-10,Bernadette>than you were.

172
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,320
<6-10,Bernadette>大概吧
<6-10,Bernadette>I guess.

173
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,430
<6-11,Howard>我到了上大学才知道
<6-11,Howard>It wasn't until college that I learned

174
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,270
<6-11,Howard>原来温度计可以放嘴里
<6-11,Howard>you can put a thermometer in your mouth.

175
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,630
<6-12,Stuart>听完这么有趣的事  晚餐也好了
<6-12,Stuart>On that charming note, dinner is served.

176
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,070
<7-1,Penny>这是你第一次跟科学家约会吗
<7-1,Penny>So is this your first time dating a scientist?

177
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,740
<7-1,Penny>因为我打算弄一个互助团
<7-1,Penny>'Cause I'm thinking of starting a support group.

178
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,350
<7-2,Rebecca>其实我不是第一次了
<7-2,Rebecca>Actually, I'm not new to this.

179
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,790
<7-2,Rebecca>我曾跟一名科学神教信徒订婚
<7-2,Rebecca>I was engaged to a Scientologist.

180
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,790
<7-2,Rebecca>科学神教是一个争议颇大的"宗教"
<7-2,Rebecca>教主曾是科幻小说家  与科学并无关联

181
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,260
<7-3,Sheldon>伯特  丽贝卡
<7-3,Sheldon>Bert, Rebecca.

182
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,860
<7-3,Sheldon>我要为我之前无心说错的话道歉
<7-3,Sheldon>I'd like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.

183
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,000
<7-4,Rebecca>别担心  没关系啦
<7-4,Rebecca>Don't worry about it. It's fine.

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,260
<7-5,Sheldon>瞧  人家说没关系
<7-5,Sheldon>See? It was fine.

185
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,700
<7-5,Sheldon>我不用出门思过
<7-5,Sheldon>I didn't need a time-out.

186
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,850
<7-6,Amy>不是真的出门思过  我们吃东西吧
<7-6,Amy>It wasn't a time-out. Let's get some food.

187
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,810
<7-7,Sheldon>你让我出门坐在楼梯上  悔过自己的所作所为
<7-7,Sheldon>You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.

188
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,760
<7-8,Amy>去拿吃的
<7-8,Amy>Get your food!

189
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,030
<7-9,Raj>你们俩怎么认识的
<7-9,Raj>So how did you two meet?

190
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,350
<7-10,Rebecca>这是一个有爱的故事
<7-10,Rebecca>Oh, it's such a cute story.

191
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,530
<7-10,Rebecca>我们在一个约会网站上认识的
<7-10,Rebecca>We met on a dating Web site.

192
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,820
<7-11,Leonard>就这样吗
<7-11,Leonard>Is that it?

193
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,280
<7-12,Rebecca>抱歉  全剧终
<7-12,Rebecca>Oh, sorry. The end.

194
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,050
<7-12,Rebecca>挺好的
<7-12,Rebecca>That's nice.

195
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,230
<7-13,Raj>我在网络交友这方面还从未成功过
<7-13,Raj>I haven't had much success meeting people online.

196
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,750
<7-14,Bert>我也是  直到我修改了我的个人档案
<7-14,Bert>I didn't either, until I revamped my profile.

197
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,940
<7-15,Sheldon>你做了什么  删掉自己的照片吗
<7-15,Sheldon>What'd you do, delete your photo?

198
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,360
<7-17,Sheldon>-出去  -好吧
<7-17,Sheldon>- Go. - Fine.

199
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,910
<7-18,Amy>你敢摔门试试
<7-18,Amy>And don't you slam that door.

200
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,590
<7-19,Sheldon>可恶
<7-19,Sheldon>Aw, man.

201
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,960
<7-20,Rebecca>我说错什么了吗
<7-20,Rebecca>Did I say something wrong?

202
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,730
<7-21,Leonard>不  说错话的永远是他
<7-21,Leonard>No, it's always him.

203
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,970
<7-22,Penny>伯特  你刚说到你更新了自己的个人档案
<7-22,Penny>So, Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?

204
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,010
<7-23,Bert>对  之前没有一个人理我  然后我加了一条
<7-23,Bert>Right. I wasn't getting any responses, and then I added,

205
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,520
<7-23,Bert>最近刚获得天才奖与奖金62.5万美元
<7-23,Bert>recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner.

206
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,900
<7-23,Bert>结果五分钟后
<7-23,Bert>and five minutes later,

207
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,800
<7-23,Bert>我就遇到了我的灵魂伴侣
<7-23,Bert>I met my soul mate.

208
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,880
<7-24,Amy>是我错了  你可以进来了
<7-24,Amy>I was wrong. You can come back in.

209
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,300
<7-25,Leonard>丽贝卡  你是怎么当上私人健身教练的呢
<7-25,Leonard>So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?

210
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,460
<7-26,Rebecca>我来洛杉矶是想成为演员
<7-26,Rebecca>I came to Los Angeles to be an actress,

211
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,570
<7-26,Rebecca>但结果并不尽如人意
<7-26,Rebecca>and things didn't really work out.

212
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,690
<7-27,Sheldon>我本来想说她又在模仿你  可是...
<7-27,Sheldon>I'd say she's copying you again, but...

213
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,140
<7-27,Sheldon>我真的不想再被赶出门外
<7-27,Sheldon>...I'm getting tired of sitting in the hall.

214
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,250
<7-27,Sheldon>我很需要一个私人健身教练
<7-27,Sheldon>I'd love a personal trainer.

215
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,370
<7-28,Raj>我下班路上开了一家网红奶昔店后
<7-28,Raj>I haven't seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack

216
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,270
<7-28,Raj>从此腹肌是路人
<7-28,Raj>on my drive home.

217
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,960
<7-29,Rebecca>我可以免费给你上几堂课
<7-29,Rebecca>I could give you some free sessions.

218
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,900
<7-30,Penny>听者有份吗
<7-30,Penny>Oh, is that offer for everybody?

219
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,350
<7-31,Leonard>省省吧  我不会去的
<7-31,Leonard>Nice try. I'm not going.

220
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,540
<7-32,Rebecca>洗手间在哪里
<7-32,Rebecca>Where's your bathroom?

221
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,510
<7-33,Leonard>就在里面
<7-33,Leonard>Mm, just down there.

222
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,280
<7-34,Bert>她真的太完美了  有时我都怀疑她不是真人
<7-34,Bert>She's so perfect, sometimes I think she isn't real.

223
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,150
<7-34,Bert>直到她去上厕所  我才能确定她是真人
<7-34,Bert>And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.

224
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,540
<7-35,Penny>真的好甜蜜好诡异哦
<7-35,Penny>Aw, that's so weird.

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,830
<7-36,Amy>恕我直言  伯特
<7-36,Amy>I'm sorry, Bert,

226
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,410
<7-36,Amy>你不担心她和你在一起只是为了钱吗
<7-36,Amy>but aren't you worried she's only with you for your money?

227
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,050
<7-37,Bert>就希望她是啊  我们第一次约会
<7-37,Bert>She better be. On our first date,

228
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,570
<7-37,Bert>我就给她买了一台80寸的平板电视
<7-37,Bert>I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.

229
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,390
<7-38,Sheldon>第一次约会就买了
<7-38,Sheldon>Your first date?

230
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,510
<7-38,Sheldon>你有量过她家电视墙有多大吗
<7-38,Sheldon>Did you even measure her walls?

231
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,970
<7-39,Penny>我们第一次约会时
<7-39,Penny>You know, on our first date,

232
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,620
<7-39,Penny>莱纳德用折价券给我买了椒盐脆饼
<7-39,Penny>Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.

233
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,480
<7-40,Leonard>从此我们就过上了幸福快乐的生活
<7-40,Leonard>And we lived happily ever after.

234
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,860
<7-41,Penny>全剧终
<7-41,Penny>The end.

235
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,480
<8-1,Bernadette>我准备出门了
<8-1,Bernadette>Well, guess I'm ready to go.

236
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,210
<8-2,Howard>祝你复工第一天愉快
<8-2,Howard>Have a great first day back.

237

<8-3,Bernadette>托儿所要用到的你都给她准备好了吗
<8-3,Bernadette>You have everything she needs for day care?

238
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,290
<8-4,Stuart>好了  都装到包包里了
<8-4,Stuart>Yep, all in the bag.

<8-4,Stuart>很好
<8-4,Stuart>Good.

240
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,780
<8-5,Bernadette>好了  宝宝
<8-5,Bernadette>Okay, sweetie,

241

<8-5,Bernadette>妈妈要去上班了  你今天玩得开心哦
<8-5,Bernadette>Mommy's gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.

242
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,090
<8-6,Howard>我跟她说了  如果托儿所跟监狱情况一样
<8-6,Howard>I told her if day care is anything like prison,

243
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,500
<8-6,Howard>那就去把最大只的宝宝打晕就对了
<8-6,Howard>find the biggest baby and knock him out.

244
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,140
<8-7,Stuart>再见  小可爱
<8-7,Stuart>Bye, cutie.

245
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,590
<8-7,Stuart>我会想你的
<8-7,Stuart>I'm gonna miss you.

246
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,500
<8-7,Stuart>我今晚会在家里等着你回来
<8-7,Stuart>I'm gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home.

247
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,520
<8-8,Bernadette>别这样  你害得我都想哭了
<8-8,Bernadette>Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

248
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,640
<8-9,Howard>这下好了  现在大家都哭了
<8-9,Howard>Great, now everybody's crying.

249
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,580
<8-10,Stuart>至少哈雷没哭啊
<8-10,Stuart>At least Halley's not.

250
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,090
<8-11,Howard>那很好啊
<8-11,Howard>That's good.

251
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,310
<8-12,Bernadette>她一整天都见不到我们  而她根本不在乎
<8-12,Bernadette>She's not gonna see us all day, and she doesn't even care!

252
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,850
<9-1,Sheldon>准备好要被逗乐了吗
<9-1,Sheldon>Who's ready to laugh?

253
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,750
<9-3,Sheldon>开讲啦
<9-3,Sheldon>Okay. So...

254
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,680
<9-3,Sheldon>费曼  爱因斯坦和薛定谔一同走进酒吧里
<9-3,Sheldon>Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar.

255
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,950
<9-3,Sheldon>费曼说
<9-3,Sheldon>Feynman says,

256
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,150
<9-3,Sheldon>看样子我们身处一个笑话里
<9-3,Sheldon>It appears we're inside a joke.

257
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,830
<9-3,Sheldon>爱因斯坦回答  但仅仅是对
<9-3,Sheldon>Einstein replies, but only to an observer

258
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,040
<9-3,Sheldon>看见我们一起走进来的人而言[相对论]
<9-3,Sheldon>who saw us walk in simultaneously.

259
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,690
<9-3,Sheldon>薛定谔对他说道
<9-3,Sheldon>To which Schrodinger says,

260
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,010
<9-3,Sheldon>薛定谔的猫这实验中  如果实验者观察[酒吧]内部
<9-3,Sheldon>可发现一只死猫[人]或活猫  而非又死又活的叠加态

261
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,010
<9-3,Sheldon>如果有人从窗户望进来观察  我就立马走人
<9-3,Sheldon>if someone's looking in the window, I'm leaving.

262
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,600
<9-4,Leonard>其实还挺好笑的
<9-4,Leonard>That's actually funny.

263
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,490
<9-5,Raj>你应该把这笑话发给脱口秀主持人
<9-5,Raj>You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.

264
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,590
<9-7,Leonard>你好  一起坐吧
<9-7,Leonard>Oh, hello. Join us.

265
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,550
<9-8,Raj>抱歉啊  昨晚气氛有点尴尬
<9-8,Raj>Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.

266
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,050
<9-9,Bert>事实上  我开始思考
<9-9,Bert>Actually, it got me thinking

267
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,630
<9-9,Bert>我不应该用炫富的方式换取爱情
<9-9,Bert>that I shouldn't flaunt my money to find love.

268
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,730
<9-9,Bert>我可能会跟丽贝卡分手
<9-9,Bert>I might break up with Rebecca.

269
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,340
<9-10,Leonard>这是个很重要的决定
<9-10,Leonard>Wow, that's a big step.

270
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,330
<9-11,Raj>这很能表现出你高尚的品德
<9-11,Raj>I think it shows a lot of character.

271
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,280
<9-12,Bert>我要等等看  看看会不会有
<9-12,Bert>I'm gonna hold out and see if I can find

272
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,860
<9-12,Bert>年轻性感的金发妞单纯喜欢我这个人
<9-12,Bert>a hot young blonde who likes me for me.

273
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,410
<9-13,Sheldon>这笑话真好笑
<9-13,Sheldon>That's a good one.

274
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,660
<9-13,Sheldon>莱纳德  轮到你说笑话了
<9-13,Sheldon>Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.

275
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,280
<10-1,Bernadette (on phone)>她还好吗
<10-1,Bernadette (on phone)>How's she doing?

276
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,690
<10-2,Howard>她很开心  你看
<10-2,Howard>She's great. Look.

277
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,940
<10-3,Bernadette>我看到墙
<10-3,Bernadette>I see a wall...

278
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,340
<10-3,Bernadette>地板
<10-3,Bernadette>floor...

279
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,310
<10-3,Bernadette>某个亚洲娃
<10-3,Bernadette>some Asian baby...

280
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,910
<10-3,Bernadette>看到她了
<10-3,Bernadette>There she is.

281
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,150
<10-4,Howard>看到没  没什么好担心的
<10-4,Howard>See? Nothing to worry about.

282
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,270
<10-5,Bernadette>谢谢
<10-5,Bernadette>Thank you.

283
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,090
<10-5,Bernadette>好了  我得试着处理工作了
<10-5,Bernadette>Okay, I'm gonna try and get some work done.

284
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,410
<10-6,Howard>好  我也是  爱你
<10-6,Howard>Yeah, me, too. Love you.

285
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,320
<10-7,Bernadette>我也爱你  再见
<10-7,Bernadette>Love you, too. Bye.

286
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,660
<10-8,Stuart>她怎么样了
<10-8,Stuart>How is she?

287
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,820
<10-9,Howard>你在这里干嘛
<10-9,Howard>What are you doing here?

288
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,100
<10-10,Stuart>一个男人就不能到一所他没读过的大学
<10-10,Stuart>Can't a guy hang out at a college he doesn't go to

289
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,680
<10-10,Stuart>盯着看一个不是他生的宝宝吗
<10-10,Stuart>and stare at a baby that isn't his?

290
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,510
<10-11,Howard>我能理解
<10-11,Howard>I get it.

291
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,210
<10-11,Howard>我都没走到办公室就忍不住来看她了
<10-11,Howard>I haven't even made it to my office yet.

292
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,810
<10-12,Stuart>如果我们一整天就站在这看她  会不会很怪
<10-12,Stuart>Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?

293
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,290
<10-13,Howard>大概会吧
<10-13,Howard>Probably.

294
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,740
<10-13,Howard>我们该走了
<10-13,Howard>We should go.

295
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,060
<10-13,Howard>是啊
<10-13,Howard>Yeah.

296
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,780
<10-14,Stuart>又或者我们可以带她去水族馆
<10-14,Stuart>Or we could take her to the aquarium.

297
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,350
<10-15,Howard>我去抱她  你去拿她的包包
<10-15,Howard>I'll get her, you grab her bag.

298
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,160
<10-16,Stuart>撑住  哈雷  我们来救你出来了
<10-16,Stuart>Hang on, Halley, we're busting you out of there!

299
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,450
<11-1,Amy>你在看什么
<11-1,Amy>What are you looking at?

300
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,240
<11-2,Sheldon>在看《旗帜背后回忆特辑》的评论
<11-2,Sheldon>Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective.

301
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,900
<11-2,Sheldon>听听这个  有人夸这一期
<11-2,Sheldon>Get this, people are calling it

302
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,180
<11-2,Sheldon>至今为最漫长的一集
<11-2,Sheldon>the longest one yet.

303
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,940
<11-3,Bert>有人在家吗
<11-3,Bert>Hello? Anybody home?

304
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,880
<11-4,Leonard>是伯特吗
<11-4,Leonard>Is that Bert?

305
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,810
<11-5,Bert>是伯特
<11-5,Bert>It's Bert.

306
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,350
<11-6,Penny>听起来好像是伯特
<11-6,Penny>I think it's Bert.

307
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,040
<11-7,Raj>怎么了
<11-7,Raj>Hey, what's up?

308
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,580
<11-8,Bert>我和丽贝卡分手了
<11-8,Bert>I broke up with Rebecca.

309
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,970
<11-10,Amy>这对你来说是好事呀
<11-10,Amy>You know, good for you.

310
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,330
<11-11,Bert>才怪  我想死她了
<11-11,Bert>No, I miss her.

311
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,860
<11-11,Bert>我不懂当时为什么要听你的
<11-11,Bert>I don't know why I listened to you.

312
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,310
<11-12,Sheldon>他说得没错
<11-12,Sheldon>He's not wrong.

313
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,920
<11-12,Sheldon>都是你瞎扯什么他值得被爱
<11-12,Sheldon>It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.

314
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,500
<11-13,Amy>下次你想说话时
<11-13,Amy>You know, you need to start raising your hand

315
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,540
<11-13,Amy>必须先举手
<11-13,Amy>before you speak.

316
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,580
<11-13,Amy>是的  从现在开始
<11-13,Amy>Yes, starting now.

317
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,830
<11-14,Penny>伯特  你是个好人  你值得被一个爱你
<11-14,Penny>Bert, you're a good guy; you deserve a woman

318
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,000
<11-14,Penny>而不是只爱你的钱的女人爱
<11-14,Penny>who's interested in more than just your money.

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,160
<11-15,Bert>她也爱只穿着小裤裤
<11-15,Bert>She was also interested in walking around my house

320
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,230
<11-15,Bert>在我家溜达
<11-15,Bert>in her underwear.

321
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,940
<11-15,Bert>现在家里会这样的人只有我了
<11-15,Bert>Now the only one doing that is me.

322
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,590
<11-16,Leonard>如果你这么难过  就把她追回来吧
<11-16,Leonard>If you're that upset, go get her back.

323
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,800
<11-17,Bert>我试过了
<11-17,Bert>I tried.

324
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,750
<11-17,Bert>她都不接我的电话了
<11-17,Bert>She's not answering my calls.

325
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,390
<11-17,Bert>一想到电话还是我买给她的  就心如刀绞
<11-17,Bert>Which really hurts because I bought her that phone.

326
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,700
<11-17,Bert>我真是犯了一个大错
<11-17,Bert>I made a huge mistake.

327
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,660
<11-18,Raj>不  你没有做错
<11-18,Raj>No, you didn't. Okay?

328
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,900
<11-18,Raj>伯特  以前我有钱时
<11-18,Raj>Look, Bert, when I had money,

329
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,950
<11-18,Raj>我和好多不合适的女孩约会过
<11-18,Raj>I dated lots of girls who weren't right for me.

330
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,190
<11-18,Raj>后来我放弃了万贯家财
<11-18,Raj>And then I gave up my money,

331
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,390
<11-18,Raj>如今我孤身一人  借宿在朋友家
<11-18,Raj>and now I'm alone and living with my friends,

332
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,770
<11-18,Raj>拜托谁快点来把这个话头接走
<11-18,Raj>and somebody else should probably talk now.

333
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,460
<11-19,Penny>亲  我说
<11-19,Penny>Look, sweetie,

334
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,270
<11-19,Penny>恋爱并不是靠金钱维系的
<11-19,Penny>relationships aren't about money, okay?

335
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,880
<11-19,Penny>而是靠相互尊重和共同之处
<11-19,Penny>It's about respect and having things in common

336
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,990
<11-19,Penny>以及...
<11-19,Penny>and...

337
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,300
<11-19,Penny>什么事  谢尔顿
<11-19,Penny>Yes, Sheldon?

338
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
<11-20,Sheldon>你和莱纳德就没有任何共同之处呀
<11-20,Sheldon>You and Leonard don't have anything in common.

339
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,880
<11-20,Sheldon>也许你俩也该分手
<11-20,Sheldon>Maybe you should break up.

340
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,930
<11-21,Leonard>你自找的
<11-21,Leonard>You called on him.

341
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,540
<12-1,Stuart>猜猜谁从托儿所回来啦
<12-1,Stuart>Guess who's home from day care?

342
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,050
<12-1,Stuart>是我们的小哈雷
<12-1,Stuart>It's Halley.

343
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,730
<12-2,Howard>除非有别人也在宝宝脚底做了X记号
<12-2,Howard>Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid's foot.

344
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,110
<12-3,Bernadette>你们一接走她  托儿所就给我打电话
<12-3,Bernadette>You realize they called when you took her.

345
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,210
<12-4,Howard>猜猜谁从水族馆回来啦
<12-4,Howard>Guess who's home from the aquarium?

346
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,870
<13-1,Bert>抱歉突然来打搅
<13-1,Bert>Sorry again for barging in.

347
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,660
<13-2,Leonard>别走嘛  我们都很欢迎你一起玩
<13-2,Leonard>You don't have to go. You're welcome to hang with us.

348
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,880
<13-3,Sheldon>事实上  我们的朋友小团体已经满员了
<13-3,Sheldon>Actually, our friendship group is at capacity.

349
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,070
<13-3,Sheldon>但如果有人退出  你将是第一候补团员
<13-3,Sheldon>But if anybody drops out, you're at the top of the list.

350
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,310
<13-3,Sheldon>除非是拉杰退出
<13-3,Sheldon>Unless it's Raj,

351
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,810
<13-3,Sheldon>那样的话  我们会需要补充一个有色人种
<13-3,Sheldon>in which case, we'll probably get a person of color.

352
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,390
<13-4,Bert>你们人太好了  但是我准备
<13-4,Bert>You guys are nice, but I'm just gonna

353
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,590
<13-4,Bert>买一台水上摩托来唤回丽贝卡芳心
<13-4,Bert>buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.

354
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,730
<13-5,Raj>我真替伯特不值
<13-5,Raj>I feel bad for Bert.

355
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,370
<13-6,Sheldon>其实他用他的钱来吸引女性
<13-6,Sheldon>So he's using his money to attract a mate.

356
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,180
<13-6,Sheldon>和我用我的智慧来吸引艾米
<13-6,Sheldon>Is that any different than me using my intelligence

357
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,420
<13-6,Sheldon>有什么不同吗
<13-6,Sheldon>to attract Amy?
