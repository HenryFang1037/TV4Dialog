<3-4,Sheldon>Penny ossoms per hour.

128
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,540
<3-4,Sheldon>再算上批量购买的材料费用
<3-4,Sheldon>Based on your wholesale selling price,

129
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,600
<3-4,Sheldon>你一天实际上只能赚...
<3-4,Sheldon>You'll effectively be paying yourself...

130
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,540
<3-5,Penny>5.19美元
<3-5,Penny>$5.19 a day.

131
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,210
<3-5,Penny>一天?
<3-5,Penny>"a day"?

132
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,340
<3-6,Sheldon>连印度尼西亚的球鞋场童工都赚得比你多
<3-6,Sheldon>There are children in a sneaker factory in indonia who outearn you.

133
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,200
<3-7,Penny>这不可能
<3-7,Penny>That just can't be right.

134
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,920
<3-8,Sheldon>-你质疑我的数学能力?  -不  抱歉
<3-8,Sheldon>You're questioning my math? no, sorry.

135
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,270
<3-10,Sheldon>想见识下我的数学大作吗?
<3-10,Sheldon>Want me to show my work?

136
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,420
<3-11,Penny>天啊  千万别
<3-11,Penny>Oh, god, no.

137
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,580
<3-11,Penny>告诉我该怎么做就好
<3-11,Penny>Just please tell me what to do about it.

138
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,390
<3-11,Penny>好吧
<3-11,Penny>All right.

139
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,500
<3-12,Sheldon>你知道奥诺雷·布兰在1778年开发的
<3-12,Sheldon>Are you familiar with the development

140
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,380
<3-12,Sheldon>可互换零件吗 ?
<3-12,Sheldon>in 1778 used interchangeable parts?

141
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,320
<3-12,Sheldon>好吧  就是生产流水线
<3-12,Sheldon>The assembly line, of course.

142
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,770
<3-13,Penny>听着  既然我不讥讽你
<3-13,Penny>Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide,

143
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,550
<3-13,Penny>你也不准显摆
<3-13,Penny>You're not allowed to be condescending.

144
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,310
<3-14,Sheldon>原始协议内不包含这条
<3-14,Sheldon>Sthat wasn't a part of our original agreement,

145
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
<3-14,Sheldon>所以我不同意
<3-14,Sheldon>And I don't agree to it now.

146
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,410
<3-15,Penny>好吧  算了
<3-15,Penny>L right, fine.

147
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,540
<3-15,Penny>我们怎么在公寓里架机器和传送带?
<3-15,Penny>How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?

148
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,940
<3-16,Sheldon>你那是指流动生产线
<3-16,Sheldon>You're thinking of the moving assembly line,

149
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,570
<3-16,Sheldon>可以理解  但依然错得不可原谅
<3-16,Sheldon>An understandable but not excusable mistake. no.

150
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,880
<3-16,Sheldon>流动生产线是在1908年由亨利·福特发明的
<3-16,Sheldon>The moving assembly line, that was introduced by henry ford in 1908.

151
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,720
<3-16,Sheldon>这项创新通过低成本的生产商品
<3-16,Sheldon>That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer

152
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,820
<3-16,Sheldon>造就了现代消费文化
<3-16,Sheldon>Culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods.

153
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,390
<3-16,Sheldon>你说的那个电台司令肯定不知道这个东西吧
<3-16,Sheldon>I guess that isn' one of the topics discussed on your radiohead.

154
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,860
<4-1,Leonard>来吧  可别错过好戏
<4-1,Leonard>Let's go. we're going to miss the coming attractions.

155
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,770
<4-2,Raj>怎么了?
<4-2,Raj>What's the matter?

156
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,160
<4-3,Howard>我在吃掉最后一个卒时扭伤了我的蛋蛋
<4-3,Howard>I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.

157
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,770
<4-4,Leonard>请稍等片刻  我便将他放倒!
<4-4,Leonard>* Give me some timeon ato blow the man down *

158
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,230
<4-5,Penny _ Sheldon together>我是香港的深海水兵  初来乍到

<4-7,Sheldon>* I'll sing you a song *

162
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,680
<4-3,Howard>请稍等片刻  我便将他放倒!
<4-3,Howard>* Give me some time to blow the man down. *

163
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,500
<4-4,Leonard>喂

<3-8,Sheldon>* To me way, hey, blow the man down *

168
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,470
<3-9,Penny>不然我会用靴子将你踢倒
<3-9,Penny>* Or I'll help you along with the toe of my boot *

169
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,740
<3-10,Sheldon>请稍等片刻  我便将他放倒!
<3-10,Sheldon>* Give me some me to blow the man down.

170
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,060
<4-5,Penny _ Sheldon together>等下  怎么回事?
<4-5,Penny _ Sheldon together>W-W-Wait, what's going on?

171
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,870
<4-6,Leonard>你是指水手之歌吗?
<4-6,Leonard>I assume you're referring to the sea chanty.

172
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,160
<4-7,Sheldon>这是一首很有节奏的工作歌
<4-7,Sheldon>It's a rhythmic work song

173
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,640
<4-7,Sheldon>能够提高产量
<4-7,Sheldon>designedo increase productivity.

174
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,510
<4-8,Penny>没错  虽然很疯狂  但的确很有效
<4-8,Penny>Yeah, it's crazy, but it totally works.

175
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,590
<4-8,Penny>看吧  我们不用3分钟
<4-8,Penny>Look, we made is Penny Blossom

176
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,970
<4-8,Penny>就完成了一个佩妮花花
<4-8,Penny>in under three minutes.

177
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,100
<4-9,Leonard>很赞  但似乎我更加一头雾水了
<4-9,Leonard>Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.

178
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,340
<4-10,Sheldon>佩妮在做头饰
<4-10,Sheldon>Penny's making hair accessories.

179
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,820
<4-10,Sheldon>我的工作是最优化生产过程
<4-10,Sheldon>I'm helping her optimize her manufacturing process.

180
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,790
<4-10,Sheldon>好了  休息时间结束
<4-10,Sheldon>Alright, break's over.

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,680
<4-11,Howard>听好命令  你们全体为一...
<4-11,Howard>* Pay attention to orders now you one and all... *

182
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,990
<4-11,Howard>等等  你用的什么黏合剂?
<4-11,Howard>Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?

183
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,140
<4-12,Sheldon>热熔胶
<4-12,Sheldon>Hot glue.

184
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,790
<4-12,Sheldon>不会吧
<4-12,Sheldon>You're kidding.

185
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,360
<4-13,Howard>任何快干胶都比它好
<4-13,Howard>Any of the cnoacrylates would do a better job.

186
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,090
<4-14,Sheldon>不管用  这花容易渗水
<4-14,Sheldon>It won't work, the flower'too porous.

187
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,330
<4-15,Leonard>我们把矽胶原液注进底层
<4-15,Leonard>What if we infused the bottom layer

188
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,000
<4-15,Leonard>这样就有了一个更牢固的底座
<4-15,Leonard>with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?

189
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,700
<4-16,Sheldon>好主意
<4-16,Sheldon>Intriguing.

190
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,940
<4-17,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>问得好
<4-17,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>Good question.

191
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,880
<4-17,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>你有什么市场营销渠道吗?
<4-17,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>Wh are your marketing and distribution channels?

192
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,420
<4-18,Penny>呃  和我一起工作的女招待
<4-18,Penny>Well, ere are the waitresses at my work,

193
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,790
<4-18,Penny>在旧城镇里有一间小巧可爱的商店...
<4-18,Penny>and this cute, little shop in Old Town...

194
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,580
<4-19,Sheldon>停停停  没有什么实体店存在
<4-19,Sheldon>Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush-- virtually non-existent.

195
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,720
<4-19,Sheldon>我在考虑  我们首先为她
<4-19,Sheldon>I'm thinking that we set her up

196
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,970
<4-19,Sheldon>建立一个电子商务监控系统
<4-19,Sheldon>with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.

197
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,720
<4-20,Howard>还要什么中介系统呢
<4-20,Howard>Why not eliminate the middle man?

198
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,060
<4-20,Howard>我们可以装一个小服务器群
<4-20,Howard>We could install a small server farm

199
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,710
<4-20,Howard>IP地址直接是她卧室!
<4-20,Howard>with a static IP in her bedroom.

200
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,740
<4-21,Leonard>那她就需要一些工业制冷系统了
<4-21,Leonard>She'd need some kind of industrial cooling system.

201
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,400
<4-22,Sheldon>当然了  不过慢着
<4-22,Sheldon>Of course, but before we set up

202
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,180
<4-22,Sheldon>我们建立市场营销基础设施之前
<4-22,Sheldon>a marketing andistribution infrastructure,

203
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,560
<4-22,Sheldon>必须先完善生产过程
<4-22,Sheldon>we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process.

204
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,810
<4-22,Sheldon>首先  现在有个严重问题
<4-22,Sheldon>To start with, she has a terrible problem

205
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,640
<4-22,Sheldon>闪粉因为受潮而凝固成块了
<4-22,Sheldon>with moisture-induced glitter clump.

206
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,940
<4-23,Penny>是啊  真是难伺候
<4-23,Penny>Yeah, it's a bitch.

207
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,510
<4-24,Howard>这我以前见过
<4-24,Howard>Uh, I've seen this before.

208
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,520
<4-25,Leonard>在哪儿?
<4-25,Leonard>Where?

209
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,110
<4-26,Howard>脱衣舞娘常遇到的问题
<4-26,Howard>It's a common stripper problem.

210
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,190
<4-26,Howard>她们一跳舞  一流汗  就凝固了嘛
<4-26,Howard>They dance, they swe, they clump.

211
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,370
<4-28,Leonard>你是不是在考虑
<4-28,Leonard>Are you thinking about adding

212
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,830
<4-28,Leonard>加点硫酸钙进去用作干燥剂呢?
<4-28,Leonard>a desiccant ke calcium sulfate?

213
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,310
<4-29,Howard>其实  我在想一个叫薇迦的脱衣舞娘
<4-29,Howard>Actually, I'm thinking about this one stripper named Vega.

214
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,760
<4-29,Howard>当然啦  可以用硫酸钙
<4-29,Howard>But re, calcium sulfate could work.

215
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,050
<4-30,Sheldon>让我们再想想别的
<4-30,Sheldon>Let's think out the box for a moment.

216
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,900
<4-30,Sheldon>用分子筛怎么样
<4-30,Sheldon>How about a molecular sieve?

217
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,840
<4-32,Penny>我厨房里有个意面筛子
<4-32,Penny>I've got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.

218
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,070
<4-34,Leonard>我们可以从化学实验室
<4-34,Leonard>Hey, we could liberate some

219
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,730
<4-34,Leonard>拿些微孔活性炭出来
<4-34,Leonard>micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.

220
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,170
<4-35,Sheldon>很好  拉杰  你和霍华德去拿活性炭
<4-35,Sheldon>Oh, great.Raj, why don't you and Howard go get the charcoal?

221
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,110
<4-35,Sheldon>莱纳德  你去给网站做个初步设计
<4-35,Sheldon>Leonard, why don't you start working on preliminary web site designs.

222
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,160
<4-35,Sheldon>我去我们公寓里腾些地方出来
<4-35,Sheldon>I'll make some space in our apartment

223
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,980
<4-35,Sheldon>这样我们可以展开生产过程
<4-35,Sheldon>so we can move the manufacturing process.

224
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,680
<4-36,Penny>我的公寓哪里不好了?
<4-36,Penny>Well, what's wrong with my apartment?

225
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,450
<4-37,Sheldon>这里不是我的公寓
<4-37,Sheldon>It's not my apartment.

226
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,960
<4-38,Penny>等等  我该干什么
<4-38,Penny>Wait, wait, what am I going to do?

227
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,760
<4-39,Leonard>呃  这是你的生意
<4-39,Leonard>Uh, hey, it's your business.

228
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,790
<4-39,Leonard>做你想做的任何事
<4-39,Leonard>Do whatever you want

229
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,130
<4-40,Penny>好  真不错
<4-40,Penny>Okay, cool.

230
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,850
<4-40,Penny>我要睡一觉
<4-40,Penny>I'm gonna take a nap.

231
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,160
<5-1,Leonard>我还在修改中
<5-1,Leonard>I'm still twinking things a little bit,

232
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,600
<5-1,Leonard>但能给你们看网站的大致样子了
<5-1,Leonard>but this will give you the general idea of the Web site.

233
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,670
<5-1,Leonard>你们觉得怎么样
<5-1,Leonard>So, what do you guys think?

234
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,860
<5-2,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>呃  不管我用何种方式说出来
<5-2,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>Uh, pretty much any way I say that

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,350
<5-2,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>都会伤到他的感情的
<5-2,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>is going to hurt his feelings.

236
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,710
<5-3,Leonard>有什么问题吗
<5-3,Leonard>Okay, what's wrong with it?

237
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,830
<5-4,Sheldon>有什么问题
<5-4,Sheldon>What's wrong with it?

238
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,110
<5-5,Leonard>不是你  我没在问你
<5-5,Leonard>Not you. I wasn't asking you.

239
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,930
<5-5,Leonard>佩妮
<5-5,Leonard>Penny?

240
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,890
<5-6,Penny>呃  有一点点幼稚
<5-6,Penny>Uh, well, it's a little juvenile.

241
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,670
<5-6,Penny>看着像一个13岁女孩的
<5-6,Penny>I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page

242
