1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,830
<1-1,Penny>喘不过气了吗
<1-1,Penny>Having a little trouble catching your breath there?

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,830
<1-1,Penny>不  不  我没事儿
<1-1,Penny>No, no, I'm good.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,650
<1-2,Leonard>要是体育老师早告诉我刻苦训练是为了这个
<1-2,Leonard>If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for,

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,360
<1-2,Leonard>我就会试着再努力点
<1-2,Leonard>I would have tried a lot harder.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,060
<1-3,Penny>要么去做  要么放手  没有尝试一说
<1-3,Penny>"Do or do not. There is no try."

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,830
<1-4,Leonard>你刚引用了星战的台词吗
<1-4,Leonard>Did you just quote star wars?

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,850
<1-5,Penny>我引用的应该是《帝国反击战》的台词
<1-5,Penny>I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,200
<1-6,Leonard>老天爷
<1-6,Leonard>Oh, my God.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,500
<1-6,Leonard>我居然和一个能引用尤达大师的话的美女躺在一起
<1-6,Leonard>I'm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda.

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,460
<1-6,Leonard>我爱你  佩妮
<1-6,Leonard>I love you, Penny.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
<1-7,Penny>谢谢
<1-7,Penny>Thank you.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,700
<1-8,Leonard>不客气
<1-8,Leonard>You're welcome.

15
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,290
<1-8,Leonard>我只是不吐不快而已
<1-8,Leonard>I just wanted to put that out there.

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,620
<1-9,Penny>不  我很高兴
<1-9,Penny>Oh, yeah, no, I-I'm-I'm glad.

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,890
<1-10,Leonard>那就好
<1-10,Leonard>Good.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,730
<1-10,Leonard>-高兴就好  -嗯
<1-10,Leonard>- Glad is good.  - Yeah.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,660
<1-11,Penny>没手表
<1-11,Penny>No, no...

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,690
<1-11,Penny>呃...已经很晚了
<1-11,Penny>So, it's getting pretty late.

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,690
<1-11,Penny>-我们差不多该睡觉吧  -对
<1-11,Penny>- We should probably go to sleep.  - Yeah.

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,190
<1-13,Penny>-对  -该睡了
<1-13,Penny>- Okay.  - Yeah, probably.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,800
<1-15,Penny>-晚安  亲爱的  -晚安
<1-15,Penny>- Okay, good night, sweetie.  - Good night.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
<1-17,Penny>生活大爆炸
<1-17,Penny>第三季第十九集

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,500
<2-1,Howard>莱纳德  你对巨型蚂蚁这个问题持什么立场
<2-1,Howard>Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?

26
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,830
<2-2,Raj>谢尔顿说不可能有
<2-2,Raj>Sheldon says impossible.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,560
<2-2,Raj>霍华德和我都觉得不仅可能
<2-2,Raj>Howard and I say not only possible,

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,250
<2-2,Raj>而且作为一种交通工具  比蝙蝠战车酷多了
<2-2,Raj>but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.

30
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,320
<2-3,Sheldon>你忽视了平方/立方定律
<2-3,Sheldon>You are ignoring the square-cube law.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,700
<2-3,Sheldon>巨型蚂蚁会被 自身的骨骼重量压垮
<2-3,Sheldon>The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton.

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,890
<2-3,Sheldon>而且准确来说
<2-3,Sheldon>And for the record,

33
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,560
<2-3,Sheldon>真正酷的交通工具排名应该是
<2-3,Sheldon>the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is:

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,090
<2-3,Sheldon>喷射背包  悬滑板  传送器  蝙蝠战车 然后才是巨型蚂蚁
<2-3,Sheldon>jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.

36
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,860
<2-4,Leonard>有没有搞错 你们就没别的事干
<2-4,Leonard>Seriously? You have nothing better to do

37
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,260
<2-4,Leonard>只能坐在这里聊巨型蚂蚁存在的可能性吗
<2-4,Leonard>than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,660
<2-5,Howard>他怎么了
<2-5,Howard>What's with him?

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,660
<2-6,Sheldon>估计他到了每月一次的敏感期了
<2-6,Sheldon>Perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.

40
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,690
<2-7,Howard>你是说他来大姨夫了[与Menstruating同音]
<2-7,Howard>Are you saying he's man-strating?

41
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,460
<2-8,Sheldon>不是字面意义上的
<2-8,Sheldon>Not literally.

42
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,960
<2-8,Sheldon>但早在十七世纪
<2-8,Sheldon>But as far back as the 17th century,

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,630
<2-8,Sheldon>科学家就发现男性荷尔蒙水平 有个33天的波动周期
<2-8,Sheldon>scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men's hormone levels.

44
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,850
<2-9,Raj>有意思
<2-9,Raj>Interesting.

45
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,220
<2-9,Raj>难怪我每月中旬都会两眼泪汪汪
<2-9,Raj>That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month.

46
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,590
<2-9,Raj>你知道我在说什么
<2-9,Raj>You know what I'm talking about.

48
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,030
<3-1,Howard>算了  不说巨型蚂蚁
<3-1,Howard>Okay, forget giant ants.

49
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,830
<3-1,Howard>巨型兔子呢
<3-1,Howard>How about giant rabbits?

50
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,960
<3-2,Raj>不管大小  我都不喜欢兔子
<3-2,Raj>Big or small, I don't like rabbits.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,660
<3-2,Raj>兔子总是看似很想说话
<3-2,Raj>They always look like they're about to say something,

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,230
<3-2,Raj>但从来不开口
<3-2,Raj>but they never do.

53
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,360
<3-3,Sheldon>兔子倒是有呼吸系统 支撑巨大的体型
<3-3,Sheldon>Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size.

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,930
<3-3,Sheldon>并且  兔子是少数哺乳动物中
<3-3,Sheldon>And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals

55
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,790
<3-3,Sheldon>阴囊长在阴茎前的
<3-3,Sheldon>whose scrotum is in front of the penis.

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,290
<3-4,Raj>也许这才是他们想谈论的
<3-4,Raj>Maybe that's what they want to talk about.

57
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,260
<3-5,Howard>莱纳德  你对巨型兔子和阴囊位置 持啥态度
<3-5,Howard>Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,530
<3-6,Leonard>我一点都不在乎
<3-6,Leonard>I honestly don't care.

59
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,330
<3-6,Leonard>是吗
<3-6,Leonard>Really?

60
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,030
<3-7,Raj>每次我们谈到不寻常的动物生殖器
<3-7,Raj>Because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals,

61
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,930
<3-7,Raj>你总会有些有力且富争议性的观点
<3-7,Raj>you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.

62
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,430
<3-8,Leonard>你想让我说什么 我就是对这个没兴趣
<3-8,Leonard>What do you want from me? I just don't give a rat's ass.

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,030
<3-9,Howard>有没有巨型老鼠屁屁
<3-9,Howard>Would that be a giant rat's ass?

64
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,000
<3-10,Sheldon>准确来说  巨型老鼠是有可能存在的
<3-10,Sheldon>For the record, giant rats are possible.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,030
<3-11,Leonard>我们能不能说点别的
<3-11,Leonard>Can we please talk about something else?

66
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,930
<3-11,Leonard>比如稍微跟我们生活有关 而且是地球上的东西
<3-11,Leonard>Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?

67
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,930
<3-12,Howard>这个话题怎么样
<3-12,Howard>Okay, how about this for a topic:

68
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,960
<3-12,Howard>为什么莱纳德是个大混蛋
<3-12,Howard>Why is Leonard being a giant douche?

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,260
<3-12,Howard>假设大混蛋有可能存在
<3-12,Howard>Assuming giant douches are possible.

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
<3-13,Sheldon>当然有
<3-13,Sheldon>Of course they are.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,360
<3-13,Sheldon>莱纳德就是一个
<3-13,Sheldon>Leonard's being one.

72
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,030
<3-14,Raj>说不定他和佩妮发生了"爱爱"口角
<3-14,Raj>Maybe he's having a lover's spat with Penny.

73
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,660
<3-15,Leonard>才怪  我们没吵架
<3-15,Leonard>No, there was no spat.

74
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,560
<3-16,Howard>但确实发生了点状况
<3-16,Howard>Oh, but something happened.

75
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,960
<3-17,Leonard>我不想谈这个
<3-17,Leonard>I don't want to talk about it.

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,430
<3-18,Sheldon>我觉得你想说  我不想听 失陪
<3-18,Sheldon>But I sense you're going to and I don't want to hear about it. Excuse me.

77
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,400
<3-19,Howard>你干啥了  罗密欧
<3-19,Howard>What'd you do, Romeo?

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,430
<3-19,Howard>往身上倒枫蜜
<3-19,Howard>You pour maple syrup all over your body

79
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,630
<3-19,Howard>问她有没有性致玩3P
<3-19,Howard>and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,180
<3-20,Raj>你是不是穿她的内裤跳来跳去取悦她
<3-20,Raj>Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around,

81
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,130
<3-20,Raj>结果却把她吓着了
<3-20,Raj>but it wound up just creeping her out?

82
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,330
<3-21,Leonard>什么  没有
<3-21,Leonard>What? No.

83
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,830
<3-22,Raj>我只是问问  老兄
<3-22,Raj>I'm just asking, dude.

84
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,630
<3-22,Raj>没准儿呢[Raj深受其害]
<3-22,Raj>It happens.

85
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,800
<3-23,Stuart>你们参加今晚的保龄球赛吗
<3-23,Stuart>You guys still on for bowling tonight?

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,600
<3-23,Stuart>当然参加
<3-23,Stuart>Oh, yes.

87
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
<3-24,Sheldon>我还准备了几句垃圾话呢
<3-24,Sheldon>In fact, I've prepared some trash talk for the occasion.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,600
<3-24,Sheldon>你打得跟你妈一个水准
<3-24,Sheldon>You bowl like your mama.

89
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,800
<3-24,Sheldon>不过  如果她打得很好
<3-24,Sheldon>Unless, of course, she bowls well.

90
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
<3-24,Sheldon>那就是  你打得跟你妈大相径庭
<3-24,Sheldon>In which case, you bowl nothing like her.

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,960
<3-25,Stuart>哦  唉哟
<3-25,Stuart>Oh. Ouch.

92
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,200
<3-26,Sheldon>这就是灼烈言辞的效果
<3-26,Sheldon>That is what is referred to as a burn on you.

93
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,960
<3-27,Howard>你要求她滴蜡吗
<3-27,Howard>Did you ask her to start waxing?

94
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,930
<3-28,Leonard>没有
<3-28,Leonard>No.

95
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,900
<3-29,Raj>你滴蜡了
<3-29,Raj>Did you start waxing?

96
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,030
<3-30,Leonard>没有
<3-30,Leonard>No.

97
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,700
<3-31,Howard>是不是做爱时
<3-31,Howard>While making love,

98
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,200
<3-31,Howard>你不小心拍了自己屁股  然后大声哭喊"妈咪"
<3-31,Howard>did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out, "Mommy"?

99
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
<3-32,Leonard>我懒得理你们
<3-32,Leonard>I'm walking away from you now.

100
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
<3-33,Howard>他没否定哎
<3-33,Howard>That wasn't a no.

101
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,900
<3-34,Raj>看来我们猜得越来越靠谱儿了
<3-34,Raj>Yeah, I think we're getting close.

102
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,280
<4-1,Howard>你是在跟她上床的时候
<4-1,Howard>Did you take a Benadryl

103
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,000
<4-1,Howard>吃了片苯海拉明(此药会造成昏昏欲睡)然后睡着了么
<4-1,Howard>and fall asleep while pleasuring her?

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,430
<4-1,Howard>你可能会因此丢了小命儿哎
<4-1,Howard>Because you can die that way.

105
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,000
<4-2,Raj>牡丹花下死  做鬼也风流啊
<4-2,Raj>Oh, that would be a good way to go.

106
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,200
<4-4,Leonard>-嗨  -嗨
<4-4,Leonard>- Hi.  - Oh, hey.

107
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,130
<4-5,Sheldon>太好了  佩妮 友情提示  今晚7点  保龄之夜
<4-5,Sheldon>Good, Penny. Reminder: bowling tonight at 7:00.

108
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,130
<4-6,Penny>噢对  保龄
<4-6,Penny>Oh, right, bowling.

109
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,360
<4-7,Leonard>你要是不想来也不用勉强
<4-7,Leonard>You don't have to come if you don't want to.

110
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,860
<4-8,Penny>不会啊  没那回事儿
<4-8,Penny>No, no, it's okay.

111
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,500
<4-8,Penny>说实话  没我的话你们指定输得巨惨
<4-8,Penny>I mean, let's face it, you guys would get creamed without me.

112
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,860
<4-9,Sheldon>确实
<4-9,Sheldon>We would indeed.

113
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,300
<4-9,Sheldon>就此特殊情况来看
<4-9,Sheldon>In this particular case,

114
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,460
<4-9,Sheldon>你纯爷们儿的气质对我们十分有利
<4-9,Sheldon>your lack of femininity works to our advantage.

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,260
<4-10,Penny>跟你聊天总是这么开心  谢尔顿
<4-10,Penny>It's always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.

116
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,200
<4-11,Sheldon>是讽刺吗
<4-11,Sheldon>Sarcasm?

117
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
<4-12,Penny>是毫不掩饰的轻视你
<4-12,Penny>Thinly veiled contempt.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,730
<4-14,Penny>-别忘了  7点  -知道啦
<4-14,Penny>- Remember: 7:00.  - Got it.

119
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,200
<4-15,Sheldon>-是太平洋夏令时  -咋着吧
<4-15,Sheldon>- Pacific Daylight time! - Bite me!

120
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,260
<4-17,Sheldon>请把这纯爷们儿的气场发挥在赛场上吧
<4-17,Sheldon>Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.

121
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,700
<5-1,Howard>你不是要带自己的保龄球鞋来吗
<5-1,Howard>I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.

122
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,800
<5-2,Sheldon>这双就是我自己的啊
<5-2,Sheldon>These are my own bowling shoes.

123

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,520
<5-23,Penny>是啊  怎么了

170
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,830
<5-24,Leonard>没事啊  只是很高兴听到 你对表达爱意毫无障碍
<5-24,Leonard>No reason. I'm just glad to hear you're comfortable saying you love something.

171
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,930
<5-25,Penny>你真的想现在谈这事儿吗
<5-25,Penny>Do you really want to get into this right now?

172
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,000
<5-25,Penny>谈啥事儿
<5-25,Penny>Get into what?

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,100
<5-26,Leonard>你怎么会不爱吃辣味奶酪薯条呢
<5-26,Leonard>Why wouldn't you love the chili cheese fries?

174
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,230
<5-26,Leonard>这么多年你一直都在吃
<5-26,Leonard>They've been in your life a long time.

175
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,530
<5-26,Leonard>它们让你心情大好  它们应该知道你对它们的爱
<5-26,Leonard>They make you happy. They deserve to know.

176
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,380
<5-27,Penny>昨晚我只是被你吓到了  我不知道说什么好
<5-27,Penny>Look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn't know what to say.

177
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,530
<5-28,Leonard>好  到现在给你的思考时间够久了吧
<5-28,Leonard>Okay, well, now you've had some time to think about it.

178
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,800
<5-28,Leonard>那你想说什么
<5-28,Leonard>So, what do you want to say?

179
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,930
<5-29,Penny>我不确定
<5-29,Penny>I'm not sure.

180
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,100
<5-30,Leonard>你怎么会不确定
<5-30,Leonard>How can you not be sure?

181
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,460
<5-31,Penny>在这谈论这事儿不太合适
<5-31,Penny>Okay, this isn't the place to have this conversation.

182
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,300
<5-32,Leonard>对啊  合适的地方是在床上
<5-32,Leonard>No, the place to have the conversation was in bed

183
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,630
<5-32,Leonard>在我说了"我爱你"
<5-32,Leonard>after I said, "I love you"

184
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,630
<5-32,Leonard>你说"谢谢  晚安"之后
<5-32,Leonard>and you said, "Thank you. Good night."

185
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,620
<5-33,Penny>别逼我  莱纳德
<5-33,Penny>Don't push it, Leonard.

186
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,700
<5-34,Leonard>-我没逼你  -你逼我了
<5-34,Leonard>- I am not pushing anything.  - You are.

187
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,930
<5-35,Penny>你没权利决定我什么时候准备好说"我爱你"
<5-35,Penny>You don't get to decide when I'm ready to say "I love you!"

188
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,030
<5-36,Raj>原来是过早的告白问题
<5-36,Raj>Ah, the premature "I love you."

189
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,030
<5-37,Howard>我猜的是过"早"的问题  算对吗
<5-37,Howard>I guessed "premature." Does that count?

190
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,040
<6-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<6-1,Sheldon>Penny.

191
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,740
<6-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<6-1,Sheldon>Penny.

192
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,740
<6-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<6-1,Sheldon>Penny.

193
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,230
<6-2,Penny>干嘛
<6-2,Penny>What?

194
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,200
<6-3,Sheldon>给你的
<6-3,Sheldon>This is for you.

195
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,860
<6-4,Penny>冰淇淋
<6-4,Penny>Ice cream?

196
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,030
<6-5,Sheldon>我通过研读连环画《凯西》[一部讲述女人生活的漫画]
<6-5,Sheldon>I've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises.

197
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,100
<6-5,Sheldon>努力想要熟悉雌性生物的感情危机
<6-5,Sheldon>by studying the comic strip Cathy.

198
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,200
<6-5,Sheldon>她一沮丧就会说"日"  然后吃冰淇淋
<6-5,Sheldon>When she's upset, she says, "Ack!" and eats ice cream.

199
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,470
<6-5,Sheldon>日啊
<6-5,Sheldon>Ack!

200
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,340
<6-7,Sheldon>你要是只猫  我就给你带千层面了
<6-7,Sheldon>If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.

201
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,000
<6-8,Penny>是莱纳德让你来的吗
<6-8,Penny>Did Leonard send you over here?

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,720
<6-9,Sheldon>不  自从你昨晚突然离开 我们还没说过话
<6-9,Sheldon>No, we haven't spoken since your abrupt departure last night

203
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,400
<6-9,Sheldon>害得我们昨天输给斯图尔特和他那卑鄙的参赛者威尔·惠顿
<6-9,Sheldon>caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.

204
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,710
<6-10,Penny>为此我很抱歉
<6-10,Penny>Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

205
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,360
<6-11,Sheldon>我毫不自豪地承认昨天我是哭着睡着的
<6-11,Sheldon>I'm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.

206
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,140
<6-12,Penny>再次说声抱歉
<6-12,Penny>Again, I'm sorry.

207
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,560
<6-13,Sheldon>让我来告诉你吧
<6-13,Sheldon>And let me tell you, sleep did not

208
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,630
<6-13,Sheldon>有莱纳德在隔壁嘶吼摇滚歌手莫莉莎的歌
<6-13,Sheldon>come easily with Leonard in the next room

209
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,900
<6-13,Sheldon>你就很难睡着了
<6-13,Sheldon>singing along with Alanis Morrisette.

210
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,630
<6-14,Penny>你开玩笑吧
<6-14,Penny>You're kidding.

211
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,740
<6-15,Sheldon>不  很显然某位来大姨夫的也急需冰淇淋来解闷
<6-15,Sheldon>No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.

212
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,590
<6-16,Penny>好吧  谢尔顿 有没有什么安慰点的消息
<6-16,Penny>All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?

213
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,660
<6-17,Sheldon>关于这一点 我自行决定了来一场复赛
<6-17,Sheldon>The part where I tell you i've engineered a rematch

214
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,960
<6-17,Sheldon>今晚重新对战斯图尔特他们
<6-17,Sheldon>with Stuart's team for tonight.

215
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,860
<6-18,Penny>亲爱的  我不知道
<6-18,Penny>Oh, honey, I don't know.

216
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,100
<6-18,Penny>现在和莱纳德在一起感觉怪怪的
<6-18,Penny>Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.

217
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,260
<6-19,Sheldon>你想让我把他踢出去吗
<6-19,Sheldon>You want me to remove him from the team?

218
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,060
<6-19,Sheldon>我是队长  我说了算
<6-19,Sheldon>I'm the captain. I can do that.

219
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,690
<6-19,Sheldon>不  没关系
<6-19,Sheldon>No, no, that's okay.

220
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,260
<6-20,Penny>我去和他谈谈  回来再找你吧
<6-20,Penny>Just let me talk to him, and I'll get back to you.

221
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,990
<6-21,Sheldon>你准备什么时候找他谈
<6-21,Sheldon>When are you going to talk to him?

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,290
<6-22,Penny>不知道
<6-22,Penny>I don't know.

223
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,590
<6-23,Sheldon>他在洗衣房  现在去正好
<6-23,Sheldon>He's in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.

224
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,790
<6-24,Penny>我不去你就一直烦我烦到死对吧
<6-24,Penny>You're n gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?

225
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,440
<6-25,Sheldon>哎呀  这还用问吗
<6-25,Sheldon>Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.

226
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,290
<7-1,Penny>我觉得我们应该谈谈
<7-1,Penny>I think we should talk now.

227
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,990
<7-1,Penny>什么  不  没事
<7-1,Penny>Wha...? No, it's okay.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,590
<7-2,Leonard>我们不用谈  也没什么可谈
<7-2,Leonard>We don't have to talk 'cause there's nothing to talk about.

229
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,620
<7-2,Leonard>一切都好
<7-2,Leonard>Everything's good.

230
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,820
<7-3,Penny>真的吗
<7-3,Penny>Really?

231
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,360
<7-3,Penny>那你生气不是因为
<7-3,Penny>So, you didn't get all snarky

232
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,690
<7-3,Penny>我对一碗辣味薯条说了句好话
<7-3,Penny>'cause I said something nice to a bowl of chili fries?

233
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,790
<7-4,Leonard>好吧  也许我反应过激了
<7-4,Leonard>All right, maybe I overreacted.

234
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,220
<7-4,Leonard>我们俩感情上不太同步  那又如何
<7-4,Leonard>So we're in two different places emotionally. So what?

235
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,190
<7-4,Leonard>或许我比你快了一点  没关系
<7-4,Leonard>And maybe I'm a little ahead of you. That's fine.

236
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,990
<7-4,Leonard>其实很合理  面对现实
<7-4,Leonard>In fact, it makes sense, 'cause let's face it,

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,270
<7-4,Leonard>我爱你比你爱我多了整整两年
<7-4,Leonard>I've been in this relationship two years longer than you.

238
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,220
<7-5,Penny>莱纳德  你要知道我很在乎你
<7-5,Penny>Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you.

239
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,120
<7-5,Penny>可我以前就是太早说"爱你"
<7-5,Penny>It's just that I've said the "L" word

240
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,390
<7-5,Penny>结果都不欢而散
<7-5,Penny>too soon before, and it didn't work out very well.

241
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,020
<7-5,Penny>是吗
<7-5,Penny>Really?

242
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,590
<7-6,Leonard>不知道那是什么情形
<7-6,Leonard>I wouldn't know what that's like.

243
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,920
<7-6,Leonard>对不起
<7-6,Leonard>I'm sorry.

244
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,890
<7-7,Penny>但你明白我的意思
<7-7,Penny>You know what I'm talking about, though.

245
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,860
<7-8,Leonard>我明白
<7-8,Leonard>Yeah, I do.

246
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,290
<7-9,Penny>我们和好了吗
<7-9,Penny>So, we're good?

247
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,890
<7-10,Leonard>对  我就是这个意思
<7-10,Leonard>Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

248
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,120
<7-10,Leonard>我们很好  好得不得了
<7-10,Leonard>We are good. We are great.

249
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,220
<7-11,Sheldon>太好了  栅栏已补  误会已清
<7-11,Sheldon>All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug.

250
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,670
<7-11,Sheldon>去打保龄球吧
<7-11,Sheldon>Time to bowl!

251
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,160
<7-11,Sheldon>对  我刚刚在偷听
<7-11,Sheldon>Yes, I was eavesdropping.

252
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,300
<7-11,Sheldon>因为赌注太大了
<7-11,Sheldon>There's a lot at stake here.

253
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,560
<8-1,Sheldon>注意  选手们
<8-1,Sheldon>Attention, all bowlers:

254
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,370
<8-1,Sheldon>我强制要求穿这个参加我们的复赛
<8-1,Sheldon>I've taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.

255
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,520
<8-3,Sheldon>"卫斯理·柯洛夏斯"
<8-3,Sheldon>"The Wesley Crushers"?

256
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,920
<8-3,Sheldon>不是指卫斯理·柯洛夏斯
<8-3,Sheldon>No, not The Wesley Crushers.

257
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,160
<8-3,Sheldon>而是卫斯理碾碎者
<8-3,Sheldon>The Wesley Crushers.

258
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,290
<8-4,Penny>我不明白
<8-4,Penny>I don't get it.

259
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,520
<8-5,Leonard>卫斯理·柯洛夏是
<8-5,Leonard>Wesley Crusher was

260
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,390
<8-5,Leonard>威尔·惠顿在《星际迷航》里扮演的角色
<8-5,Leonard>Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek.

261
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,620
<8-6,Penny>还是不明白
<8-6,Penny>Still don't get it.

262
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,990
<8-7,Sheldon>这是个极其巧妙的双关语
<8-7,Sheldon>It's a blindingly clever play on words.

263
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,660
<8-7,Sheldon>在他所饰演的角色名后面加个复数
<8-7,Sheldon>By appropriating his character's name and adding the S,

264
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,630
<8-7,Sheldon>暗示着我们将是彻底终结卫斯理的人
<8-7,Sheldon>we imply that we we'll be the crushers of Wesley.

265
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,920
<8-8,Penny>好吧  抱歉亲爱的
<8-8,Penny>Okay, I'm sorry, honey,

266
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,190
<8-8,Penny>但你这样写  看起来就好像有好多粉丝
<8-8,Penny>but The Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people

267
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,360
<8-8,Penny>喜欢卫斯理·柯洛夏
<8-8,Penny>who like Wesley Crusher.

268
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,560
<8-9,Sheldon>不  再次强调  不是卫斯理·柯洛夏粉丝群
<8-9,Sheldon>No! Again, it's not the Wesley Crushers.

269
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,430
<8-9,Sheldon>而是卫斯理·柯洛夏终结者
<8-9,Sheldon>It's the Wesley Crushers.

270
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,860
<8-10,Howard>如果你想表示  你将彻底打败卫斯理
<8-10,Howard>No, if you want it to mean you're crushing Wesley,

271
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,960
<8-10,Howard>就该直接写  打倒卫斯理·柯洛夏
<8-10,Howard>it'd be the Wesley Crushers.

272
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,390
<8-11,Sheldon>听听你们说的什么胡话
<8-11,Sheldon>Do you people even hear yourselves?

273
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,060
<8-8,Penny>这不是什么卫斯理·柯洛夏斯
<8-8,Penny>It's not The Wesley Crushers.

274
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,390
<8-6,Penny>也不是卫斯理粉丝群
<8-6,Penny>It's not The Wesley Crushers.

275
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,920
<8-3,Sheldon>而是卫斯理终结者
<8-3,Sheldon>It's The Wesley Crushers.

276
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,020
<8-11,Sheldon>看哪
<8-11,Sheldon>Hey, look.

277
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,200
<8-12,Wil>他们那队是以我名字命名的
<8-12,Wil>They named their team after me.

278
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,420
<8-13,Sheldon>不  这才不是...
<8-13,Sheldon>No, it's not the...

279
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,400
<8-13,Sheldon>算了
<8-13,Sheldon>Never mind.

280
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,390
<8-14,Stuart>好了  都清楚打赌内容和赌注了
<8-14,Stuart>So, we're all clear on the bet and the stakes?

281
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,160
<8-15,Sheldon>当然  输的一方将接受公开羞辱
<8-15,Sheldon>Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated

282
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,420
<8-15,Sheldon>具体方式由胜者选定
<8-15,Sheldon>in a fashion to be chosen by the victor.

283
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,290
<8-15,Sheldon>告诉你  我准备让你们发表篇科学论文
<8-15,Sheldon>FYI: I plan on having you publish a scientific paper

284
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,200
<8-15,Sheldon>详细说明维利科夫斯基那荒谬的假设
<8-15,Sheldon>expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.

285
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,530
<8-16,Stuart>再次唉哟
<8-16,Stuart>Ouch again.

286
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,500
<8-17,Wil>你好  谢尔顿
<8-17,Wil>Hey, Sheldon,

287
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,660
<8-17,Wil>我只想告诉你
<8-17,Wil>I just wanted you to know

288
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,690
<8-17,Wil>我热切期盼着打得你一败涂地
<8-17,Wil>that I'm really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.

289
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,960
<8-18,Sheldon>真的吗
<8-18,Sheldon>Oh, yes?

290
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,590
<8-18,Sheldon>回应你之前  我先问你个问题
<8-18,Sheldon>Well, before I respond, let me a you a question.

291
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,930
<8-18,Sheldon>你妈妈保龄球打得好不好
<8-18,Sheldon>Is your mother a good or poor bowler?

292
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,430
<8-19,Wil>你先
<8-19,Wil>After you.

293
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,540
<8-20,Sheldon>不  你先
<8-20,Sheldon>No, after you...

294
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,670
<8-20,Sheldon>因为我们准备终结你  卫斯理
<8-20,Sheldon>as we are  currently crushing you, Wesley.

295
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:30,100
<8-21,Wil>右边球道的选手先投  这是种习惯
<8-21,Wil>It's customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.

296
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,400
<8-22,Sheldon>好吧
<8-22,Sheldon>All right.

297
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,860
<8-23,Wil>只是种习惯  并非规则
<8-23,Wil>It's a custom, not a rule.

298
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,220
<8-24,Sheldon>我真鄙视你
<8-24,Sheldon>I so loathe you.

299
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,290
<8-25,Wil>就是这样  谢尔顿
<8-25,Wil>That's right, Sheldon.

300
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,930
<8-25,Wil>要学会接受社会阴暗面
<8-25,Wil>Embrace the dark side.

301
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,900
<8-26,Sheldon>你根本没权利跟我这么说
<8-26,Sheldon>That's not even from your franchise!

302
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,890
<8-27,Stuart>我想让你知道 即使我们是对立一方
<8-27,Stuart>I, um, I want you to know that even though we're on opposite sides,

303
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,120
<8-27,Stuart>我始终对你并无恶意
<8-27,Stuart>I, I bear you no ill will.

304
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,900
<8-28,Penny>谢谢  斯图尔特  很高兴知道这点
<8-28,Penny>Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.

305
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,060
<8-29,Stuart>对立双方的人 往往都关系非常好
<8-29,Stuart>People from opposite sides often have good relationships.

306
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,760
<8-29,Stuart>比如  罗密欧与朱丽叶
<8-29,Stuart>You know, Romeo and Juliet...

307
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,490
<8-29,Stuart>《西区故事》里的托尼和玛利亚
<8-29,Stuart>Tony and Maria from West Side Story,

308
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,900
<8-29,Stuart>《阿凡达》里那个谁和那大蓝妞
<8-29,Stuart>what's-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar.

309
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,130
<8-29,Stuart>我要去掷球了
<8-29,Stuart>I'm gonna bowl now.

310
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,590
<8-30,Sheldon>人球合一  霍华德
<8-30,Sheldon>Be the ball, Howard.

311
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,470
<8-31,Howard>别烦我  谢尔顿
<8-31,Howard>Leave me alone, Sheldon.

312
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,500
<8-32,Sheldon>你没做到人球合一
<8-32,Sheldon>You weren't the ball.

313
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,120
<8-33,Penny>谢谢
<8-33,Penny>Hey, thanks.

314
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,420
<8-34,Leonard>很好玩是吧
<8-34,Leonard>This is fun, huh?

315
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,720
<8-35,Penny>对呀
<8-35,Penny>Yeah.

316
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,790
<8-36,Leonard>很高兴我们能出来  来点体育锻炼
<8-36,Leonard>It's good that we got out and did something physical.

317
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,290
<8-38,Leonard>能分散下注意力
<8-38,Leonard>Gets us out of our heads.

318
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,190
<8-38,Leonard>人一旦纠结什么事
<8-38,Leonard>You get in your head,

319
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,390
<8-38,Leonard>很容易就会想多  钻牛角尖  心神不宁还烦恼
<8-38,Leonard>you start to overthink, overanalyze,obsess, you worry.

320
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,890
<8-38,Leonard>但今晚咱不这样
<8-38,Leonard>That's not what we're doing tonight.

321
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,890
<8-38,Leonard>今晚咱就专心玩保龄球
<8-38,Leonard>Tonight we're just throwing a ball at some pins.

322
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,320
<8-39,Penny>对  就是这样
<8-39,Penny>Yeah, that's right.

323
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,030
<8-40,Leonard>也许有一天  未来的某一天 你也会爱回我
<8-40,Leonard>and someday-- we don't know when-- maybe you'll love me back.

324
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,600
<8-40,Leonard>唔  该我了
<8-40,Leonard>Ooh, I'm up.

325
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,470
<8-41,All (chanting)>谢尔顿  谢尔顿  谢尔顿  加油
<8-41,All (chanting)>Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!

326
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,360
<8-42,Sheldon>不好意思
<8-42,Sheldon>Excuse me.

327
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,030
<8-42,Sheldon>真不知道你们是在为谁加油  我现在可是球哦
<8-42,Sheldon>I don't know who you're chanting for as I am currently the ball.

328
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,520
<8-43,All (chanting)>球球  加油
<8-43,All (chanting)>The ball! The ball!

<8-43,All (chanting)>球球  加油
<8-43,All (chanting)>The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!

330
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,230
<8-44,Sheldon>感谢上帝
<8-44,Sheldon>Thank you, Jesus!

331
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,330
<8-44,Sheldon>我妈肯定会这么说
<8-44,Sheldon>As my mother would say.

332
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,320
<8-45,Wil>很高兴你跟你男友言归于好了
<8-45,Wil>I'm glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.

333
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,390
<8-46,Penny>是呀  我也是
<8-46,Penny>Oh, yeah, me, too.

334
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,420
<8-47,Wil>在你毫无准备的时候  面对突如其来的示爱
<8-47,Wil>It's always tough when the "L" bomb gets dropped

335
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,060
<8-47,Wil>一向都很难处理的
<8-47,Wil>and you're not ready for it.

336
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,520
<8-48,Penny>说来听听
<8-48,Penny>Tell me about it.

337
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,720
<8-49,Wil>我就跟这么个女孩约会过
<8-49,Wil>I dated this one girl,

338
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,190
<8-49,Wil>我跟她示爱的时候
<8-49,Wil>and I told her that I loved her,

339
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,560
<8-49,Wil>她说她还不确定[自己感情的归属]
<8-49,Wil>and she said she wasn't sure.

340
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,490
<8-49,Wil>然后跟我藕断丝连将近两年时间
<8-49,Wil>And she strung me along for almost two years.

341
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,760
<8-49,Wil>那实在太残忍了
<8-49,Wil>It was brutal.

342
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,760
<8-50,Penny>太遗憾了
<8-50,Penny>Oh, I'm sorry.

343
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,270
<8-50,Penny>谢谢安慰
<8-50,Penny>Thanks.

344
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,120
<8-51,Wil>宁愿她当场就跟我痛快分手
<8-51,Wil>I wish she had just broken up with me right there,

345
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,590
<8-51,Wil>长痛不如短痛
<8-51,Wil>and put me out of my misery.

346
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,590
<8-52,Penny>真的
<8-52,Penny>Really?

347
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,990
<8-53,Wil>对  那样反而好
<8-53,Wil>Yeah, would have been kinder.

348
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,290
<8-54,Stuart>威尔  到你了
<8-54,Stuart>Wil, you're up.

349
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,270
<8-55,Wil>该我了
<8-55,Wil>Oh, that's me.

350
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,790
<8-56,Sheldon>你刚让威尔·惠顿给你洗脑了
<8-56,Sheldon>Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?

351
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,060
<8-57,Penny>你在说什么呀
<8-57,Penny>What are you talking about?

352
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,860
