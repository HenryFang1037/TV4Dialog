1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,850
<1-2,Howard>-你错了  -你屁咧
<1-2,Howard>- You're wrong. - No, I'm not.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,070
<1-3,Raj>-你就错了  -我才没有
<1-3,Raj>- Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,840
<1-4,Howard>你来当裁判  网上会动的那些图片
<1-4,Howard>Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,960
<1-4,Howard>是念"动图"还是"动土"
<1-4,Howard>are they called "Gifs" or "Jifs"?

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,640
<1-4,Howard>外国网上曾热吵过  GIF是念 "gi福" 还是"鸡福"
<1-4,Howard>但无论如何  反正不是念"鸡爱a福"

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,780
<1-5,Leonard>图代表的是"图片"嘛
<1-5,Leonard>Well, the G stands for "Graphics."

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,640
<1-5,Leonard>很明显啊  所以我认为是"动图"
<1-5,Leonard>That's a hard G, so I'd say "Gif."

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,320
<1-6,Raj>但发明的那男的说是念"动土"啊
<1-6,Raj>W... The guy who invented it says it's "Jif."

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,250
<1-7,Howard>抱歉  你是说那"男"的还是那"兰"的
<1-7,Howard>I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,160
<1-8,Sheldon>我给你们三次机会
<1-8,Sheldon>Well, I'll give you three guesses

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,040
<1-8,Sheldon>猜我为什么很不爽
<1-8,Sheldon>why I'm so irritated.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,820
<1-9,Howard>是不是什么事不如你愿呀
<1-9,Howard>Something happened different from the way you wanted it.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,160
<1-10,Sheldon>看来坏事真是传千里啊
<1-10,Sheldon>I guess news travels fast.

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,790
<1-10,Sheldon>你猜对了  一群科学家被选去
<1-10,Sheldon>It's true, a select group of scientists

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,740
<1-10,Sheldon>参加一个周末学术报告会
<1-10,Sheldon>was invited to a weekend symposium

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,300
<1-10,Sheldon>举办地点在理查德·费曼的旧居
<1-10,Sheldon>at a former home of Richard Feynman,

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,870
<1-10,Sheldon>生于1918年的伟大美国物理学家
<1-10,Sheldon>1965年的诺贝尔物理奖得主

18
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,870
<1-10,Sheldon>而我居然没入选
<1-10,Sheldon>and I wasn't included.

19
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,010
<1-11,Leonard>谢尔顿  我相信他们绝对不是因为
<1-11,Leonard>Oh, Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,930
<1-11,Leonard>你并非精英科学家而没选你
<1-11,Leonard>they don't think you're an elite scientist.

21
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,130
<1-12,Howard>是啊  我敢赌全部身家
<1-12,Howard>Yeah, I bet you anything

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,420
<1-12,Howard>绝对只是因为你是烦人精
<1-12,Howard>it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,620
<1-13,Sheldon>你们说这些话只是为了哄我而已
<1-13,Sheldon>You're just saying that to make me feel better.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,680
<1-14,Leonard>你可以今天一整天都叽歪这事
<1-14,Leonard>Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,760
<1-15,Sheldon>会的
<1-15,Sheldon>Agreed.

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,020
<1-16,Leonard>我本来要接"但也可以"  但何苦浪费唇舌
<1-16,Leonard>I was gonna say "or," but why bother?

33
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,480
<2-1,Bernadette>拉杰
<2-1,Bernadette>Hey, Raj.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,320
<2-2,Raj>我有小礼物送你们
<2-2,Raj>Hey, I got you a little gift.

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,790
<2-3,Bernadette>这些女童军义卖饼干也太多了吧
<2-3,Bernadette>Oh, that's a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.

36
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,250
<2-4,Raj>你懂我  我从印度来的
<2-4,Raj>You know me. I'm from India.

37
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,790
<2-4,Raj>我抵抗不了儿童乞讨的眼神
<2-4,Raj>I can't resist children begging.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,900
<2-4,Raj>房子继承权这事进展顺利吗
<2-4,Raj>So, how's it going with the title to the house?

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,030
<2-5,Howard>顺利  都解决了
<2-5,Howard>Great, it's all done.

40
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,630
<2-5,Howard>律师找到了我父亲
<2-5,Howard>The lawyer tracked down my father

41
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,700
<2-5,Howard>让他签字同意转让给我
<2-5,Howard>and got him to sign it over.

42
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,440
<2-5,Howard>我不需要跟他见面  也不需要跟他说话
<2-5,Howard>I didn't have to meet him, I didn't have to talk to him,

43
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,500
<2-5,Howard>我都不知道他在哪
<2-5,Howard>I don't even know where he is.

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,650
<2-6,Raj>所以你完全不好奇吗
<2-6,Raj>Wow, so you're not curious at all?

45
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,680
<2-7,Howard>不
<2-7,Howard>Nope.

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
<2-8,Raj>说不定他是名囚犯
<2-8,Raj>What if he's in prison?

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,860
<2-8,Raj>又或者是名间谍
<2-8,Raj>What if he's a spy?

48
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,370
<2-8,Raj>万一他是披头士翻唱乐队的成员呢
<2-8,Raj>What if he's in a Beatles cover band?

49
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,790
<2-8,Raj>我就说说  要是他也有你这鼻子跟发型
<2-8,Raj>I'm just saying, if he's got your nose and haircut,

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,520
<2-8,Raj>扮林戈一定像到爆
<2-8,Raj>he'd make a killer Ringo.

52
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,020
<3-1,Wil Wheaton>再次谢谢你愿意来上节目
<3-1,Wil Wheaton>Thanks again for agreeing to do this.

53
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,530
<3-2,Penny>这很酷  我从来都没上过播客
<3-2,Penny>Oh, it's cool; I've never been on a podcast before.

54
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,040
<3-3,Leonard>那你的第一次选对了
<3-3,Leonard>Well, you picked a good one to start.

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,450
<3-3,Leonard>威尔有过很多很棒的来宾
<3-3,Leonard>Wil's had lots of great guests.

56
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,760
<3-3,Leonard>乔纳森·弗雷克斯  布兰特·史宾纳
<3-3,Leonard>Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner,

57
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,160
<3-3,Leonard>迈克·多恩  盖茨·麦克法登
<3-3,Leonard>Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden...

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,870
<3-4,Penny>他们是《星际迷航》的人对吧
<3-4,Penny>Those are Star Trek people.

59
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,910
<3-5,Leonard>没错
<3-5,Leonard>Yes!

60
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,270
<3-6,Penny>我能猜出来单纯是因为完全没听过他们
<3-6,Penny>I only figured that out because I've never heard of any of them.

61
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,130
<3-7,Wil>是我自己找虐
<3-7,Wil>I deserve that.

63
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,200
<3-7,Wil>我邀请你上我节目  我还得大老远开车过来
<3-7,Wil>I invited you on my show and I drove here.

64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,510
<3-8,Penny>抱歉
<3-8,Penny>Sorry.

65
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,080
<3-9,Wil>这个基本上就像是小型访谈节目
<3-9,Wil>Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show.

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,660
<3-9,Wil>我们会接几通听众来电
<3-9,Wil>Uh, we're gonna take some calls,

67
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,350
<3-9,Wil>我们会聊聊在拍摄
<3-9,Wil>we'll talk about what it was like on the set

68
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,020
<3-9,Wil>《杀人恶猿2》时的情况
<3-9,Wil>of Serial Ape-ist 2.

69
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,930
<3-9,Wil>应该会挺有趣的
<3-9,Wil>It should be really fun.

70
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,190
<3-10,Leonard>-好兴奋啊  -是啊
<3-10,Leonard>- This is exciting. - Yeah.

71
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,470
<3-11,Penny>所以大概有多少听众呢
<3-11,Penny>So, how many people listen?

72
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,680
<3-12,Wil>大多数人都是之后下载节目听
<3-12,Wil>Most people download it later,

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,990
<3-12,Wil>但通常实时听众大概也有个几千人吧
<3-12,Wil>but usually a few thousand people listen live.

74
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,880
<3-13,Penny>什么  有几千人
<3-13,Penny>What?! A few thousand people

75
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,030
<3-13,Penny>愿意听你说这些宅爆的东西吗
<3-13,Penny>listen to you talk about nerd stuff?

76
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,270
<3-14,Wil>又一次  话入我耳
<3-14,Wil>Again, right in the ears,

77
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,440
<3-14,Wil>直插我心
<3-14,Wil>straight to the feelings.

78
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,690
<4-1,Amy>能把盐递给我吗
<4-1,Amy>Can you please pass the salt?

79
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,010
<4-1,Amy>行
<4-1,Amy>Sure.

80
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,280
<4-2,Sheldon>反正我也没被邀请去理查德·费曼家
<4-2,Sheldon>It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,540
<4-2,Sheldon>也没有更重要的事情可做
<4-2,Sheldon>and have anything better to do.

82
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,570
<4-3,Amy>你今晚一整晚都会像这样子吗
<4-3,Amy>Is this how the rest of the night's going to be?

83
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,820
<4-4,Sheldon>我又不能预知未来
<4-4,Sheldon>I don't know the future.

84
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,100
<4-4,Sheldon>你觉得有可能会有
<4-4,Sheldon>Do you think there's a chance

85
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,970
<4-4,Sheldon>一颗陨石撞到地球上
<4-4,Sheldon>that an asteroid could hit the Earth,

86
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,280
<4-4,Sheldon>刚好撞烂费曼家  还撞死里面所有人吗
<4-4,Sheldon>destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it?

87
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,730
<4-5,Amy>不可能  谢尔顿
<4-5,Amy>No, Sheldon.

88
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,890
<4-6,Sheldon>那做好准备  小爷要闹脾气一整晚了
<4-6,Sheldon>Then buckle up; you're in for a cranky night.

89
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,810
<4-7,Amy>根据恋爱合约的附录
<4-7,Amy>According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement

90
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,530
<4-7,Amy>你自己特别坚持要的
<4-7,Amy>which you insisted upon,

91
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,380
<4-7,Amy>我们不允许在约会之夜撅嘴闹脾气
<4-7,Amy>we're not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.

92
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,920
<4-8,Sheldon>你明知道我加上那条是防你大姨妈到访
<4-8,Sheldon>You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.

93
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,230
<4-9,Amy>规矩对你也同样适用
<4-9,Amy>Well, it applies to you, too.

94
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,520
<4-10,Sheldon>我就怕你会提起这件事
<4-10,Sheldon>I was afraid you might bring this up,

95
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,300
<4-10,Sheldon>所以我钻了漏洞
<4-10,Sheldon>so I have a work-around.

96
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,540
<4-10,Sheldon>满意了吧
<4-10,Sheldon>There you go.

97
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,240
<4-10,Sheldon>就你看来  我是在笑
<4-10,Sheldon>As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling.

98
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,580
<4-10,Sheldon>虽然我不得不承认  我现在的确是在小小窃笑
<4-10,Sheldon>Although, I must admit, I'm smiling a little bit at the moment

99
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,680
<4-10,Sheldon>因为此举实在太机智了
<4-10,Sheldon>because this loophole is so brilliant.

100
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,130
<5-1,Raj>伯纳黛特  你想好了
<5-1,Raj>So, Bernadette, have you thought

101
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,060
<5-1,Raj>怎么重新装修这地方吗
<5-1,Raj>about how you're going to redecorate this place?

102
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,560
<5-2,Bernadette>我在考虑
<5-2,Bernadette>You know, I'm thinking

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
<5-2,Bernadette>拆了这地毯
<5-2,Bernadette>ripping up the carpets,

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,340
<5-2,Bernadette>墙纸也全部撕了
<5-2,Bernadette>maybe lose the wallpaper,

105
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,880
<5-2,Bernadette>弄新的灯架
<5-2,Bernadette>all new light fixtures...

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,710
<5-3,Raj>其实  如果你拆掉这面墙
<5-3,Raj>You know, if you knocked out this wall,

107
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,490
<5-3,Raj>你整个格局就会变成开放式的
<5-3,Raj>it would give you an open floor plan,

108
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,690
<5-3,Raj>然后...或许有点吓人  但也可能好玩
<5-3,Raj>and then-- it's a little scary, but could be fun--

109
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,260
<5-3,Raj>在这弄个室内壁炉
<5-3,Raj>indoor fire pit.

110
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,000
<5-4,Howard>我在这房子里长大
<5-4,Howard>Hey, I grew up in this house, okay?

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
<5-4,Howard>谁都不许拆任何东西
<5-4,Howard>No one's knocking anything down.

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,970
<5-5,Bernadette>行  行
<5-5,Bernadette>Okay, okay.

113
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,810
<5-5,Bernadette>等他去了漫展
<5-5,Bernadette>When he's at Comic-Con,

114
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,360
<5-5,Bernadette>我立马找个大铁球来拆
<5-5,Bernadette>I'm bringing in a wrecking ball.

115
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,760
<5-6,Howard (answering door)>有事吗
<5-6,Howard (answering door)>Can I help you?

116
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,750
<5-7,Guy at door>您好  请问是霍华德·沃罗威茨吗
<5-7,Guy at door>Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?

117
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,220
<5-8,Howard>是的
<5-8,Howard>Yes.

118
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,880
<5-9,Guy>这有点怪
<5-9,Guy>Um, this is a little weird,

119
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,090
<5-9,Guy>但有一个律师之前联系了我父亲
<5-9,Guy>but a lawyer was trying to contact my father,

120
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,220
<5-9,Guy>因为当时这间屋子还在他名下
<5-9,Guy>because his name was still on the title for this house.

121
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,310
<5-10,Howard>你父亲是哪位
<5-10,Howard>W... uh, who's your father?

122
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,750
<5-11,Guy>山姆·沃罗威茨
<5-11,Guy>Sam Wolowitz.

123
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,920
<5-12,Howard>山姆·沃罗威茨是我的父亲
<5-12,Howard>S-Sam Wolowitz is my father.

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,390
<5-13,Guy>我知道
<5-13,Guy>I know.

125
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,270
<5-14,Howard>慢着  如果我们的父亲是同一个人
<5-14,Howard>Well, wait, so if we have the same father...

126
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,790
<5-14,Howard>那你的意思是

<6-29,Kevin>片名叫《疯狂店员3》
<6-29,Kevin>It's called Clerks 3.

<6-31,Leonard>You have a new job.

195
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,440
<6-32,Penny>或许我可以两边兼顾
<6-32,Penny>Well, maybe I can do both.

196
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,480
<6-33,Leonard>我不认为你可以两边兼顾
<6-33,Leonard>I don't think you can do both.

197
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,210
<6-34,Penny>我不认为我有问你意见
<6-34,Penny>I don't think I asked you.

<6-36,Leonard>别多管闲事  凯文·史密斯
<6-36,Leonard>Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.

200
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,770
<7-1,Sheldon>你认为人生中是否会出现一个转折点
<7-1,Sheldon>Do you think there comes a point in life

201
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,260
<7-1,Sheldon>让你不再为被人忽略而感觉难过呢
<7-1,Sheldon>when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?

202
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,820
<7-2,Amy>估计不会
<7-2,Amy>Probably not.

203
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,070
<7-2,Amy>被纳入团体活动是一种进化优势
<7-2,Amy>It's an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.

204
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,220
<7-2,Amy>你知道吗
<7-2,Amy>You know what?

205
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,210
<7-3,Sheldon>我以前挺喜欢进化的
<7-3,Sheldon>I used to be a fan of evolution,

206
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,690
<7-3,Sheldon>但在我已进化后
<7-3,Sheldon>but I've since evolved,

207
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,960
<7-3,Sheldon>现在想想其实挺蠢的
<7-3,Sheldon>and now I think it's dumb.

208
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,280
<7-4,Amy>被忽略会让人非常难过
<7-4,Amy>Being left out is a terrible feeling.

209
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,680
<7-4,Amy>没有人比我更了解这种感觉
<7-4,Amy>No one understands that better than I do.

210
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,760
<7-5,Sheldon>快听听
<7-5,Sheldon>Hey, look at that.

211
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,120
<7-5,Sheldon>即便在自己的例子里  你也是孤身一人
<7-5,Sheldon>Even in your example, you're all by yourself.

212
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,480
<7-6,Amy>当年在我的学校虱子肆虐的时候
<7-6,Amy>When there was a lice epidemic at my school,

213
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,340
<7-6,Amy>人人头上都有  唯独我没有
<7-6,Amy>everybody got it except me.

214
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,990
<7-6,Amy>我试着往头发上撒糖骗其他人
<7-6,Amy>I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair,

215
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,760
<7-6,Amy>但下场只是被蜜蜂蛰了一顿
<7-6,Amy>but I just got attacked by bees.

216
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,890
<7-7,Sheldon>我可以想象他们现在在费曼旧居里的画面
<7-7,Sheldon>I can just picture them all right now at Feynman's house,

217
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,320
<7-7,Sheldon>可能  在讨论薛定谔
<7-7,Sheldon>probably discussing Schrodinger

218
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,750
<7-7,Sheldon>奥地利物理学家
<7-7,Sheldon>于1935年提出的有关"猫既是死的又是活的"著名思想实验

219
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,750
<7-8,Amy>同时  又不在讨论薛定谔
<7-8,Amy>and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger.

220
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,080
<7-6,Amy>瞧
<7-6,Amy>See?

221
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,170
<7-7,Sheldon>他们错过了像这样有哽又有趣的笑话
<7-7,Sheldon>They're missing out on hilarious jokes like that.

222
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,540
<7-8,Amy>同时  又没过错
<7-8,Amy>And at the same time, not.

223
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,660
<7-9,Sheldon>这让我想起我的白痴哥哥姐姐
<7-9,Sheldon>It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister

224
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,380
<7-9,Sheldon>他们在客厅搭建堡垒
<7-9,Sheldon>would build forts in the living room

225
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,840
<7-9,Sheldon>却不让我进去
<7-9,Sheldon>and wouldn't let me in.

226
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,160
<7-9,Sheldon>恨得我牙痒痒
<7-9,Sheldon>I hated that so much.

227
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
<7-9,Sheldon>或许
<7-9,Sheldon>dort dort dort You know,

228
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,700
<7-10,Amy>我不能让你获邀去参加学术报告会
<7-10,Amy>there's nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium,

229
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,780
<7-10,Amy>但如果你想
<7-10,Amy>but if you wanted...

230
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,540
<7-10,Amy>我们可以搭建一座堡垒
<7-10,Amy>we could build a fort.

231
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,330
<7-11,Sheldon>那会不会有点太幼稚了
<7-11,Sheldon>Isn't that a little juvenile?

232
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,570
<7-12,Amy>会比这个还幼稚吗
<7-12,Amy>More juvenile than this?

233
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,790
<7-13,Sheldon>我去拿毯子
<7-13,Sheldon>I'll get the blankets.

234
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,350
<7-13,Sheldon>你上网搜搜如何享受孩子般的乐趣
<7-13,Sheldon>You Google how to have childlike fun.

235
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,640
<8-1,Howard>我真是个不尽责的主人
<8-1,Howard>You know what, I'm being a bad host.

236
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,880
<8-1,Howard>我去加点咖啡
<8-1,Howard>Let me get some more coffee.

237
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,610
<8-2,Bernadette>我来吧  霍华德

<11-1,Howard>你居然还能听见我说话
<11-1,Howard>I'm surprised you could hear me

341
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,590
<11-1,Howard>因为你的耳朵已经被薄荷糖塞住了

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,820
<12-4,Penny>不是  是股票及债券的多元化投资组合
<12-4,Penny>No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

362
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,990
<12-4,Penny>我没有太保守
<12-4,Penny>I'm not overly conservative.

363
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,720
<12-4,Penny>毕竟还年轻  理财的说我冒得了这些风险
<12-4,Penny>I'm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.

364
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,480
<12-5,Leonard>等等  你还有个理财的
<12-5,Leonard>Wait a minute, you have "a guy"?

365
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,730
<12-6,Penny>你没有吗
<12-6,Penny>Don't you have a guy?

366
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,590
<12-7,Leonard>我都没钱要什么理财的
<12-7,Leonard>Why would I have a guy? I don't have any money!

367
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,840
<12-8,Penny>宝贝
<12-8,Penny>Oh, sweetie,

368
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,160
<12-8,Penny>你真应该去赚点钱了
<12-8,Penny>you should really get some money.

369
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,490
<12-9,Wil>各位听众
<12-9,Wil>For those of you listening at home,

370
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,460
<12-9,Wil>这戏老好看了
<12-9,Wil>how great is this?

371
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,400
<12-10,Leonard>威尔  拜托你把那个关了吧
<12-10,Leonard>Wil, I'm begging you, just please turn that off.

372
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,930
<12-11,Wil>好的
<12-11,Wil>Sure.

373
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,940
<12-11,Wil>欢迎回来
<12-11,Wil>And we're back.

374
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,470
<12-12,Penny>莱纳德  你为什么要这么在乎这些事
<12-12,Penny>Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this?

375
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,040
<12-12,Penny>这几年我们的角色确实有些变化
<12-12,Penny>So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years.

376
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,520
<12-12,Penny>人生就是这样啊
<12-12,Penny>This is the way life is.

377
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,350
<12-12,Penny>风水轮流转  很快就又转回你这里了
<12-12,Penny>And I'm sure in time they'll change again.

378
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,000
<12-13,Leonard>太好了  你现在不仅事业比我成功
<12-13,Leonard>Great, you're not only more successful than me,

379
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,200
<12-13,Leonard>人还比我成熟了
<12-13,Leonard>now you're more mature.

380
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,330
<12-14,Penny>那这样  如果我做点蠢事
<12-14,Penny>Okay, look, would it make you feel better

381
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,720
<12-14,Penny>你会开心一点吗  比如我翘一天班
<12-14,Penny>if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day

382
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,210
<12-14,Penny>去参加一下凯文·史密斯的试镜
<12-14,Penny>to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?

383
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,540
<12-15,Leonard>那就太好了  谢谢
<12-15,Leonard>That would be great, thank you!

384
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,200
<12-16,Wil>我就插一下话  很快
<12-16,Wil>I'm just gonna jump in here real quick.

385
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,780
<12-16,Wil>莱纳德  就在不久前
<12-16,Wil>Leonard, a moment ago,

386
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,750
<12-16,Wil>你还极力反对佩妮重回她的演艺事业
<12-16,Wil>you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career,

387
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,240
<12-16,Wil>现在你又全力支持了
<12-16,Wil>but now you're all for it.

388
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,720
<12-16,Wil>是不是说明她将你玩弄于股掌之中
<12-16,Wil>Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?

389
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,060
<12-17,Leonard>是的没错  威尔
<12-17,Leonard>Yes, it is, Wil.

390
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,340
<13-1,Josh>我忍不住想问
<13-1,Josh>So, I have to ask,

391
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,590
<13-1,Josh>那个机器人很性感吗
<13-1,Josh>was the robot sexy?

392
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,340
<13-2,Howard>它其实就是只机械手[第4季第1集]
<13-2,Howard>It was actually just a mechanical hand.

393
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,970
<13-3,Josh>因为有只手就够了  对吧
<13-3,Josh>'Cause that's all you need, right?

394
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,380
<13-4,Howard>你真是我亲弟
<13-4,Howard>You are my brother.

395
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,690
<13-4,Howard>好  第一届年度最佳堡垒大赛
<13-4,Howard>Okay, so the final four forts

396
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,630
<14-1,Sheldon>最后四强为
<14-1,Sheldon>in the first annual best fort ever contest,

397
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,460
<14-1,Sheldon>或简称堡垒大对决
<14-1,Sheldon>or "Fort off," are...

398
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,700
<14-1,Sheldon>诺克斯堡
<14-1,Sheldon>...Fort Knox,

399
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,340
<14-1,Sheldon>提康德罗加堡
<14-1,Sheldon>Fort Ticonderoga,

400
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,800
<14-1,Sheldon>萨姆特堡
<14-1,Sheldon>Fort Sumter and...

401
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,180
<14-1,Sheldon>舒适毯堡
<14-1,Sheldon>Fort Cozy McBlanket.

402
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,610
<14-1,Sheldon>我认为
<14-1,Sheldon>I'd say...

403
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,520
<14-2,Amy>诺克斯堡力压提康德罗加堡
<14-2,Amy>Knox over Ticonderoga

404
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,830
<14-2,Amy>诺克斯堡是美国国库黄金存放处
<14-2,Amy>提康德罗加堡是美国旧时极富战略意义的堡垒

405
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,830
<14-2,Amy>因为它那有金子
<14-2,Amy>'cause it's got the gold.

406
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,910
<14-4,Amy>舒适毯堡完胜萨姆特堡
<14-4,Amy>And McBlanket over Sumter

407
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,050
<14-4,Amy>萨姆特堡曾在1861年被轰炸
<14-4,Amy>随后林肯总统对南方宣战  爆发南北战争

408
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,050
<14-4,Amy>因为它织物针数高
<14-4,Amy>'cause it has a higher thread count.

409
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,320
<14-4,Amy>十点了
<14-4,Amy>10:00.

410
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,880
<14-4,Amy>约会之夜结束了
<14-4,Amy>Date night's over.

411
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,110
<14-5,Sheldon>等等  不要
<14-5,Sheldon>Wait, no.

412
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,020
<14-5,Sheldon>我们还没选出冠军呢
<14-5,Sheldon>We haven't picked a winner.

413
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,130
<14-6,Amy>我们都知道这个堡会胜出的
<14-6,Amy>We both know this one's gonna win.

414
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,840
<14-7,Sheldon>确实如此
<14-7,Sheldon>Well, of course we do.

415
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,000
<14-7,Sheldon>毕竟诺克斯堡没有秘密物理学图书馆
<14-7,Sheldon>Fort Knox doesn't have a secret physics lending library.

416
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,390
<14-8,Amy>来  我帮你拆了
<14-8,Amy>Come on, I'll help you take this down.

417
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,210
<14-8,Amy>等等
<14-8,Amy>Well, wait.

418
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,330
<14-9,Sheldon>我们破例一晚
<14-9,Sheldon>What if, just this once,

419
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,680
<14-9,Sheldon>约会之夜的限制因素暂时失效
<14-9,Sheldon>we suspend the date night parameters

420
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,980
<14-9,Sheldon>你多待一会
<14-9,Sheldon>and you stay later?

421
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,390
<14-10,Amy>既然限制因素暂时失效
<14-10,Amy>Well, as long as we're suspending the parameters,

422
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,670
<14-10,Amy>我可以待到非常晚
<14-10,Amy>I could stay really late

423
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,620
<14-10,Amy>我们还可以第一次同居一晚
<14-10,Amy>and we could have our first sleepover.

424
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,870
<14-11,Sheldon>这进度相当大
<14-11,Sheldon>That's a big step.

425
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,010
<14-12,Amy>毕竟这么大个堡
<14-12,Amy>It's a big fort.

426
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,830
<14-13,Sheldon>很好
<14-13,Sheldon>Very well.

427
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,890
<14-13,Sheldon>我同意来一晚
<14-13,Sheldon>I will agree to a family-friendly,

428
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,400
<14-13,Sheldon>老少咸宜  阖家欢乐的大众级过夜
<14-13,Sheldon>G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.

429
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,760
<14-14,Amy>家长陪同级
<14-14,Amy>Pg.

430
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,350
<14-14,Amy>某些场景对少儿来讲过于强烈
<14-14,Amy>Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.

431
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,520
<14-15,Sheldon>老幼皆宜级
<14-15,Sheldon>G-rated,

432
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,340
<14-15,Sheldon>附有对有婴儿及幼童家庭的警示
<14-15,Sheldon>with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.

433
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,010
<14-16,Amy>你成功获得过夜小伙伴
<14-16,Amy>You got yourself a sleepover.

434
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,920
<14-17,Sheldon>用不用借你牙刷和睡衣
<14-17,Sheldon>Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?

435
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,660
<14-18,Amy>我要是说为了以备不时之需
<14-18,Amy>Would it alarm you to know

436
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,170
<14-18,Amy>我两年前就在这藏好了一份过夜包
<14-18,Amy>that I hid those things here two years ago

437
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,580
<14-18,Amy>你会不会吓到
<14-18,Amy>just in case this ever came up?

438
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,920
<14-19,Sheldon>会的
<14-19,Sheldon>It would,

439
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,700
<14-19,Sheldon>但你知道我对充分准备是有多欣赏的
<14-19,Sheldon>but you know how much I admire preparedness.

440
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,420
<14-19,Sheldon>你怎么知道我们会在客厅睡呢
<14-19,Sheldon>How did you know we'd be in the living room?

441
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,060
<14-20,Amy>谁告诉你我只藏了这一份了
<14-20,Amy>Who says this is the only one I hid?

442
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,760
<15-1,Leonard>有人吗  这什么东西
<15-1,Leonard>Hello? What is this?

443
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,690
<15-2,Sheldon>我们建了个堡垒
<15-2,Sheldon>We built a fort!

444
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,460
<15-3,Leonard>那是我床单吗
<15-3,Leonard>Are those my sheets?

445
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,150
<15-4,Amy>没错
<15-4,Amy>Yes, they are.

446
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,130
<15-4,Amy>好吧
<15-4,Amy>Okay.

447
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,200
<15-5,Leonard>孩子们  你们开心就好
<15-5,Leonard>Well, you kids have fun.

448
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,140
<15-5,Leonard>我去睡了
<15-5,Leonard>I'm gonna go to sleep.

449
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,710
<15-6,Sheldon>莱纳德  你不想看看堡垒里面什么样子吗
<15-6,Sheldon>Leonard, don't you want to see the inside of the fort?

450
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,780
<15-7,Leonard>不用了
<15-7,Leonard>Yeah, I'm good.

451
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,090
<15-8,Sheldon>来嘛
<15-8,Sheldon>Oh, come on.

452
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,630
<15-8,Sheldon>我真的很想试试将人拒之门外
<15-8,Sheldon>I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in.

453
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,780
<15-9,Leonard>好吧
<15-9,Leonard>Okay, fine.

454
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,150
<15-9,Leonard>谢尔顿  我能进你的堡垒参观一下吗
<15-9,Leonard>Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?

455
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,040
<15-10,Sheldon>我想拒绝
<15-10,Sheldon>I want to say no,

456
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,370
<15-10,Sheldon>但里面太霸气了  快进来
<15-10,Sheldon>but it's too glorious. Get in here!

457
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,970
<15-11,Leonard>谢谢
<15-11,Leonard>Thank you.

458
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,810
<15-12,Amy>请在地上就座
<15-12,Amy>Okay, have a seat on the floor.

459
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,300
<15-13,Sheldon>那里不行  那是我的专座
<15-13,Sheldon>Not there. That's my spot.
