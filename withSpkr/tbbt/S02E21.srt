00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,930
<1-15,Sheldon>太荒谬了

<1-30,Howard>她把我甩了
<1-30,Howard>She dumped me!

47
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,100
<1-31,Sheldon>我看他是《巴比伦5号》的
<1-31,Sheldon>I bet he's someone from Babylon 5.

48
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,000
<1-31,Sheldon>我们猜不中了
<1-31,Sheldon>We're never going to get it.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,730
<2-1,Raj>莱斯利怎么了  为什么甩你
<2-1,Raj>What happened with Leslie? Why did she dump you?

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,430
<2-2,Howard>我不知道  她就说
<2-2,Howard>I don't know. She just said,

58
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
<2-2,Howard>霍华德  老娘见异思迁了
<2-2,Howard>"Howard, Mama's a rolling stone."

59
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,130
<2-2,Howard>然后电话哔了一声就挂了
<2-2,Howard>Then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,230
<2-3,Sheldon>我不明白
<2-3,Sheldon>I don't understand.

61
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,000
<2-3,Sheldon>如果你们之间没有感情
<2-3,Sheldon>If you were in a non-emotional relationship, then why

62
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,300
<2-3,Sheldon>怎么情绪反应得这么波动
<2-3,Sheldon>are you having what appears to be an emotional response?

63
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,430
<2-4,Leonard>谢尔顿  他显然对她有感情
<2-4,Leonard>Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.

64
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,370
<2-5,Howard>我当然对她有感情
<2-5,Howard>Of course I had feelings for her.

65
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,600
<2-5,Howard>我看了她的裸体呢  老天
<2-5,Howard>I saw her naked, for God's sake.

66
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,330
<2-6,Leonard>你要转移一下注意力
<2-6,Leonard>Okay, look, you just need to get your mind off it.

67
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,170
<2-6,Leonard>想不想去漫画书店
<2-6,Leonard>Do you want to go to the comic book store?

68
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,270
<2-6,Leonard>或者看部电影
<2-6,Leonard>Maybe go see a movie?

69
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,470
<2-7,Howard>我哪也不想去
<2-7,Howard>I don't want to go anywhere.

70
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,800
<2-8,Sheldon>我发现内华达州有一大堆
<2-8,Sheldon>I'm given to understand that there's an entire city in Nevada

71
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,270
<2-8,Sheldon>特别设计的城市能帮霍华德这类人
<2-8,Sheldon>designed specifically to help people like Howard

72
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,670
<2-8,Sheldon>忘却他们的烦恼
<2-8,Sheldon>forget their problems.

73
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
<2-8,Sheldon>直接用新烦恼替代
<2-8,Sheldon>They can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism,

74
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,000
<2-8,Sheldon>比如酗酒  赌博  性传播疾病
<2-8,Sheldon>gambling addiction, and sexually transmitted diseases.

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,000
<2-9,Raj>是我想错了  还是谢尔顿在说去维加斯
<2-9,Raj>Is it me, or was that Sheldon's way of saying, "Vegas, baby!"?

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,870
<2-10,Leonard>我没去过那儿  你呢
<2-10,Leonard>I've never been there. Have you?

77
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,370
<2-11,Raj>我也没有
<2-11,Raj>Me? No.

78
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,970
<2-11,Raj>我引用文森·沃恩在《摇摆者》里的话而已
<2-11,Raj>I just got "Vegas, baby!" from Vince Vaughn in Swingers.

79
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,370
<2-12,Howard>应该不错啊  反正现在周末也空下来了
<2-12,Howard>It could be fun. I know my weekend's wide open, now that...

80
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,600
<2-13,Leonard>就这么办  我们去维加斯吧
<2-13,Leonard>Okay, let's do this. Let's go to Las Vegas.

81
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,270
<2-14,Howard>-现在就去吗  -何乐而不为呢
<2-14,Howard>- Now? Right now? - Why not?

82
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,030
<2-15,Leonard>大家都做即兴的事
<2-15,Leonard>People do things "right now," all the time.

83
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,870
<2-15,Leonard>我们也即兴一把
<2-15,Leonard>Why can't we be "right now" people, too?

84
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,800
<2-15,Leonard>回家收拾行李  我们就是即兴一族了
<2-15,Leonard>Go home, pack a bag, and we'll be "right now" people.

85
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,030
<2-15,Leonard>但是 我得先去药店买药
<2-15,Leonard>I mean, I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription,

86
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,530
<2-15,Leonard>买完药  我们就即兴去
<2-15,Leonard>but after that, we'll go right now.

87
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,030
<2-16,Raj>你意下如何  霍华德
<2-16,Raj>What do you say, Howard?

88
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,930
<2-17,Howard>我觉得
<2-17,Howard>I say...

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,700
<2-17,Howard>去维加斯吧
<2-17,Howard>"Vegas, baby!"

90
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,470
<2-18,Raj>你怎么跟你妈说
<2-18,Raj>What are you going to tell your mother?

91
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,830
<2-19,Howard>我去海洋世界
<2-19,Howard>"Sea World, baby!"

92
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,270
<2-20,Leonard>谢尔顿  你去吗
<2-20,Leonard>Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?

93
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,630
<2-21,Sheldon>即使让丽蝇在我耳道里
<2-21,Sheldon>I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs

94
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,130
<2-21,Sheldon>产卵孵幼虫  我也不去
<2-21,Sheldon>and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,900
<2-22,Leonard>行  我们会给你带T恤
<2-22,Leonard>Great. We'll bring you back a t-shirt.

103
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,030
<3-6,Penny>你喝醉了?
<3-6,Penny>Are you drunk?

104
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,970
<3-7,Sheldon>我就是心情好嘛
<3-7,Sheldon>I'm just in a good mood.

105
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,170
<3-7,Sheldon>我的同胞们都去维加斯了
<3-7,Sheldon>While my compatriots are in Las Vegas,

106
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,570
<3-7,Sheldon>我就能在这美好的夜晚 独自享受《孤独要塞》了
<3-7,Sheldon>I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.

107
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,270
<3-8,Penny>你指的是超人的那个大冰冻那啥对吧
<3-8,Penny>That's Superman's big ice thingy, right?

108
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,130
<3-9,Sheldon>我现在心情好
<3-9,Sheldon>You know, I'm in such a good mood,

109
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,030
<3-9,Sheldon>居然觉得你对英语词汇掌握之贫乏
<3-9,Sheldon>I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp

110
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,570
<3-9,Sheldon>甚至有一点可爱的说
<3-9,Sheldon>of the English language folksy and charming today.

111
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,770
<3-10,Penny>什么闻着这么香
<3-10,Penny>Mmm. What smells so good?

112
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,070
<3-11,Sheldon>这是奶油咖喱的醉人香气
<3-11,Sheldon>That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer,

113
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,900
<3-11,Sheldon>更是对这个自由的傍晚
<3-11,Sheldon>a perfect culinary representation

114
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,430
<3-11,Sheldon>通过美食的完美体现
<3-11,Sheldon>of the freedom this evening holds.

115
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,800
<3-11,Sheldon>这不光是库萨帕里所厌恶的印度美食
<3-11,Sheldon>Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes,

116
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,930
<3-11,Sheldon>并且有大量花生作为配菜
<3-11,Sheldon>it contains a generous helping of peanuts,

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,070
<3-11,Sheldon>能把沃罗威茨变成一个97磅的呼哧呼哧的大泡泡
<3-11,Sheldon>which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97-pound blister.

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,900
<3-11,Sheldon>还有  主料是干酪  一种农家芝士
<3-11,Sheldon>And finally, its main ingredient is paneer, a farmer's cheese

119
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,400
<3-11,Sheldon>莱纳德食用后会瞬间让同房间的人
<3-11,Sheldon>that would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable

120
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,470
<3-11,Sheldon>死不见血
<3-11,Sheldon>within minutes.

121

<3-12,Penny>Penny.

124
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,170
<3-13,Sheldon>我知道你今晚也是一个人
<3-13,Sheldon>I realize you're also on your own tonight,

125
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,730
<3-13,Sheldon>如果你万一觉得一个人无聊了
<3-13,Sheldon>so if, at some point, you find yourself with nothing to do,

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,130
<3-13,Sheldon>请不要来打扰我
<3-13,Sheldon>please do not disturb me.

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,070
<6-16,Leonard>好吧  我真的不想打击 你所谓的"雄性激素"
<6-16,Leonard>Okay. I hate to break this to you and whatever your "jammy" is,

220
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,830
<6-16,Leonard>但我可以肯定她只是个娼妓
<6-16,Leonard>but I'm pretty sure she's a prostitute.

221
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,270
<6-17,Raj>什么
<6-17,Raj>What?

222
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,270
<6-17,Raj>不能吧
<6-17,Raj>No...

223
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,730
<6-18,Leonard>那我换个方式解释吧
<6-18,Leonard>Let me put it this way:

224
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,610
<6-18,Leonard>在你的一生中  能有几个超级美女
<6-18,Leonard>In your entire life, how many gorgeous women

225
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,080
<6-18,Leonard>会一进酒吧就过来跟你搭讪
<6-18,Leonard>have walked straight up to you in a bar

226
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,970
<6-18,Leonard>还问你要不要去参加派对?
<6-18,Leonard>and asked if you wanted to party?

227
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,330
<6-19,Raj>或许我可以感化她
<6-19,Raj>Maybe I can save her.

228
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,470
<6-20,Leonard>或许吧  但我猜你可能会为此 付出每小时500美元的代价
<6-20,Leonard>Maybe, but I'm guessing it'll cost you about $500 an hour to try.

229
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,670
<6-21,Raj>很高兴认识你 祝你的未来更加灿烂美好

233
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,270
<6-24,Leonard>他在博客上最新的留言写着

<6-24,Leonard>我正处于黑洞的最底端 凝视着绝望的深渊
<6-24,Leonard>"I'm at the bottom of a black hole "staring into the abyss.

235
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,670
<6-24,Leonard>我的生活毫无意义  我的未来一片茫然
<6-24,Leonard>My life is meaningless. My future is without hope."

236
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,510
<6-25,Raj>要不带他去看蓝人乐队吧
<6-25,Raj>Why don't we take him to see the Blue Man Group?

237
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,510
<6-26,Leonard>你觉得会有用吗
<6-26,Leonard>You think that'd help?

<6-27,Raj>"今日美国"称他们为"老少咸宜爆笑组合"
<6-27,Raj>USA Today calls them "exuberant fun for the whole family."

239
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,240
<6-28,Leonard>我不知道  霍华德不是那种 通吃老少咸宜乐趣的人
<6-28,Leonard>I don't know. Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy.

240
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,340
<6-29,Raj>真可惜他没在这  见不到那个妓女
<6-29,Raj>It's too bad he wasn't here for that hooker.

241
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,270
<6-29,Raj>她绝对是他喜欢的类型  标准的妓女
<6-29,Raj>She's exactly his type; a hooker.

242
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,810
<6-29,Raj>如果给钱请她帮忙  霍华德一定能振作起来
<6-29,Raj>You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.

243
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,270
<6-30,Leonard>我坚决不同意让妓女去安抚沃罗威茨
<6-30,Leonard>We're not gonna get Wolowitz a hooker.

244
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,040
<6-31,Raj (reading Howard’s twitter)>我是如此孤独  熊熊的欲火燃烧着我
<6-31,Raj (reading Howard’s twitter)>"I'm so lonely and horny,

245
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,470
<6-31,Raj (reading Howard’s twitter)>我随时会开一瓶20美元的花生酱  然后全部干掉
<6-31,Raj (reading Howard’s twitter)>I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all."

246
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,410
<6-32,Leonard>让她报个价  应该不会被打吧
<6-32,Leonard>I suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate.

247
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,910
<7-1,Sheldon>你今天过得好吗
<7-1,Sheldon>So how was your day?

248
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,170
<7-2,Penny>你想跟我聊家常吗
<7-2,Penny>Are you trying to make small talk?

249
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
<7-2,Penny>亲爱的  你真的不必这么做
<7-2,Penny>Oh, sweetie, you really don't have to.

250
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,270
<7-3,Sheldon>错  这是个惯有的习俗
<7-3,Sheldon>No, it's the accepted convention.

251
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,770
<7-3,Sheldon>你今天过得好吗
<7-3,Sheldon>How was your day?

252
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,340
<7-4,Penny>他们把餐厅的值班表全都打乱了
<7-4,Penny>Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant,

253
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,910
<7-4,Penny>所以我的时间会跟平时有点不一样
<7-4,Penny>so my hours are gonna be a little differe...

254
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,440
<7-5,Sheldon>抱歉  我对此一点都不感兴趣  快吃吧
<7-5,Sheldon>I'm sorry. That's not going to interest me at all. Just eat.

255
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,170
<8-1,Raj>你好啊  小姐
<8-1,Raj>Hello again.

256
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,670
<8-2,Michaela>你们好啊
<8-2,Michaela>Oh, hi.

257
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,170
<8-3,Leonard>你好  如果您不忙的话
<8-3,Leonard>Yeah, hi. Listen, um... if you're not busy,

258
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,310
<8-3,Leonard>我们想知道你是否...
<8-3,Leonard>we were thinking maybe you could...

259
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,670
<8-3,Leonard>我们其实是想问...
<8-3,Leonard>We were wondering...

260
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,440
<8-4,Raj>你到底是不是娼妓
<8-4,Raj>...if you're really a prostitute.

261
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,070
<8-5,Michaela>你们是警察吗
<8-5,Michaela>You guys cops?

262
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,770
<8-6,Together>当然不是
<8-6,Together>No.

263
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,670
<8-7,Michaela>那好  我是娼妓
<8-7,Michaela>I'm a prostitute.

264
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,940
<8-8,Leonard>太好了
<8-8,Leonard>Okay, great.

265
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,440
<8-8,Leonard>事情是这样的  我们有个朋友
<8-8,Leonard>Uh, the thing is, we've got this friend,

266
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,440
<8-8,Leonard>他被甩了  很沮丧
<8-8,Leonard>and he's kind of down in the dumps.

267
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,770
<8-8,Leonard>我们觉得你可以让他振作起来
<8-8,Leonard>And we thought maybe you could cheer him up.

268
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,010
<8-9,Raj>用你的床上功夫
<8-9,Raj>With sex.

269
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,370
<8-10,Leonard>不用说的这么直白吧
<8-10,Leonard>I think she knows what I meant.

270
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,270
<8-11,Raj>你在那兜来兜去她怎么可能明白
<8-11,Raj>How can she when you beat around the bush?

271
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,540
<8-11,Raj>她可是红灯区的
<8-11,Raj>She's from the mean streets

272
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,210
<8-11,Raj>那里的人都是二话不说直接干正事的
<8-11,Raj>where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.

273
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,070
<8-12,Michaela>放心吧  我会好好照顾你们的朋友
<8-12,Michaela>Don't worry. I can take good care of your friend.

274
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,910
<8-13,Leonard>好的  太棒了
<8-13,Leonard>Okay, terrific.

275
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,870
<8-13,Leonard>那请问能不能不让他
<8-13,Leonard>Uh, um... listen, is there a way that we can do this

276
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,340
<8-13,Leonard>知道你的真实身份是...
<8-13,Leonard>where he doesn't know that you're a, you know...

277
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,840
<8-14,Raj>娼妓
<8-14,Raj>Prostitute.

278
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,970
<8-15,Michaela>你们想要女友式的服务啊
<8-15,Michaela>You want the girlfriend experience.

279
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,740
<8-16,Leonard>对  对  正是
<8-16,Leonard>Yes. Yeah, exactly.

280
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,540
<8-15,Michaela>女友式的服务
<8-15,Michaela>The girlfriend experience.

281
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,540
<8-17,Raj>其实  能不能再问一下
<8-17,Raj>Actually, if it's not too much to ask,

282
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,340
<8-17,Raj>能不能搞成犹太人式的女友服务
<8-17,Raj>could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience?

283
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,370
<9-1,Sheldon>这是第20个问题了
<9-1,Sheldon>Okay, that's question 20.

284
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,670
<9-1,Sheldon>你接着猜
<9-1,Sheldon>You have to guess.

285
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,110
<9-2,Penny>谢尔顿  放过我吧
<9-2,Penny>I don't know, Sheldon.

286
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,510
<9-2,Penny>你是《星球大战》吗
<9-2,Penny>Are you Star Wars?

287
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,910
<9-3,Sheldon>一个人怎么可能变身成一部电影呢
<9-3,Sheldon>How can one person be a whole movie?

288
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,270
<9-4,Penny>我放弃了  能不能找点别的事干
<9-4,Penny>Okay, I give up. Can we just do something else?

289
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,740
<9-4,Penny>好吧
<9-4,Penny>Fine.

290
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,270
<9-5,Sheldon>其实人家是斯波克啦
<9-5,Sheldon>I was Spock.

291
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,870
<9-7,Sheldon>你和莱纳德是"互利友人"吗
<9-7,Sheldon>Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?

292
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,870
<9-6,Penny>什么
<9-6,Penny>What?

293
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,110
<9-7,Sheldon>你和莱纳德是"互利友人"吗
<9-7,Sheldon>Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?

294
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,640
<9-8,Penny>这是谁无中生有的
<9-8,Penny>Where did that even come from?

295
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,770
<9-8,Penny>是他说的吗
<9-8,Penny>Did he say we were?

296
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
<9-9,Sheldon>不  莱纳德什么都没说
<9-9,Sheldon>No, Leonard said nothing.

297
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,710
<9-9,Sheldon>但他假装说你的信寄错了
<9-9,Sheldon>But who knows what goes on over here

298
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,970
<9-9,Sheldon>谁知道你们到底在搞什么
<9-9,Sheldon>when he pretends your mail was misdelivered?

299
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
<9-10,Penny>只是寄信  没有其他
<9-10,Penny>Just mail, no benefits.

300
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,340
<9-11,Sheldon>我明白了
<9-11,Sheldon>I see.

301
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,640
<9-12,Penny>你为什么问这个
<9-12,Penny>Why are you asking?

302
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,340
<9-13,Sheldon>我对于整个交际圈很是好奇
<9-13,Sheldon>I'm curious about the whole social construct.

303
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,370
<9-13,Sheldon>表面上看来 关于满足个人性欲方面
<9-13,Sheldon>On its face, the idea of satisfying one's sexual appetite--

304
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,370
<9-13,Sheldon>假设某人受到这方面的折磨
<9-13,Sheldon>assuming one is afflicted with such--

305
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,560
<9-13,Sheldon>没有感情上的纠葛 这看似相当具有实用性
<9-13,Sheldon>without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical.

306
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,570
<9-13,Sheldon>不过  据我观察 霍华德·沃罗维茨却是 哭得像个小女孩一样
<9-13,Sheldon>What I've observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.

307
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,740
<9-14,Penny>有些人只是无法处理好 那种关系而已
<9-14,Penny>Well, some people just can't handle that kind of relationship.

308
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,440
<9-15,Sheldon>你能么
<9-15,Sheldon>Can you?

309
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,840
<9-16,Penny>什么
<9-16,Penny>Excuse me?

310
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,940
<9-17,Sheldon>你能否做到跟一个与自己
<9-17,Sheldon>Are you able to have sex with men

311
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,810
<9-17,Sheldon>毫无情感依恋的男人上床呢
<9-17,Sheldon>without developing an emotional attachment?

312
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,310
<9-18,Penny>谢尔顿  我实在不想跟你讨论这个话题
<9-18,Penny>Sheldon, I really don't want to talk about this with you.

313
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,510
<9-19,Sheldon>这个话题让你感到不适了吗
<9-19,Sheldon>Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?

314
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,110
<9-20,Penny>当然了  我很不爽  看不出来吗
<9-20,Penny>Of course it's making me uncomfortable. Can't you tell?

315
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,670
<9-21,Sheldon>我看不出来
<9-21,Sheldon>I really have no idea.

316
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,870
<9-21,Sheldon>我实在不擅长解读
<9-21,Sheldon>I don't particularly excel

317
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,640
<9-21,Sheldon>脸部表情和肢体语言
<9-21,Sheldon>at reading facial expressions, body language...

318
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,170
<9-22,Penny>我要发飙了  谢同学
<9-22,Penny>I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!

319
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,010
<9-23,Sheldon>谢谢  我了解了
<9-23,Sheldon>Thank you. That's very helpful.

320
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,310
<10-1,Howard>好啦  极品虾仁在哪儿呢
<10-1,Howard>All right, where are these amazing shrimp?

321
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,540
<10-2,Leonard>看
<10-2,Leonard>Behold.

322
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,440
<10-3,Howard>说真的  你觉得这有婴儿手臂大吗
<10-3,Howard>Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby's arm?

323
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,270
<10-4,Raj>迷你婴儿
<10-4,Raj>A little baby.

324
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,610
<10-5,Howard>我回房间了
<10-5,Howard>Okay, I'm going back to the room.

325
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,770
<10-6,Michaela (arriving)>天啊  上一盘上等"胸肉" 他们会死么!
<10-6,Michaela (arriving)>Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?

326
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,870
<10-7,Howard>你好  我叫霍华德·沃罗维茨
<10-7,Howard>Hi, there. Howard Wolowitz.

<10-8,Michaela>我叫埃斯特·罗森布拉特
<10-8,Michaela>Esther Rosenblatt.

328
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,140
<11-1,Penny>看来管理员今晚不来了  给你
<11-1,Penny>I don't think the manager's coming tonight, so here.

329
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,310
<11-2,Sheldon>你准备让我睡沙发么
<11-2,Sheldon>Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch?

330
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,310
<11-3,Penny>我起初不这么想
<11-3,Penny>Well, it wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind,

331
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,070
<11-3,Penny>但现在就这么定
<11-3,Penny>but it's the one I'm going with.

332
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,610
<11-4,Sheldon>我不能睡沙发  我是睡床的
<11-4,Sheldon>I can't sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed.

333
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,070
<11-4,Sheldon>你看看这尺寸
<11-4,Sheldon>And given its dimensions,

334
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,210
<11-4,Sheldon>我可不想成为EM斯尼科林畅销儿童书
<11-4,Sheldon>I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering's

<11-6,Sheldon>康沃尔巨人
<11-6,Sheldon>"There was a tall man from Cornwall

338

<11-6,Sheldon>身高超过床
<11-6,Sheldon>"whose length exceeded his bed.

339
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,710
<11-6,Sheldon>身子躺不平
<11-6,Sheldon>"My body fits on it, but barely upon it,

340
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,370
<11-6,Sheldon>大头容不下
<11-6,Sheldon>there's no room for my big Cornish head."

341
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,210
<11-7,Penny>我让你睡我的床  但有一个条件
<11-7,Penny>All right, I will give you my bed on one condition:

342
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,940
<11-7,Penny>你得在接下来8小时内闭上嘴
<11-7,Penny>that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.

343
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,640
<11-8,Sheldon>我能说最后一句话吗
<11-8,Sheldon>May I say one last thing?

344
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,240
<11-9,Penny>只要不押韵就成
<11-9,Penny>Only if it doesn't rhyme.

345
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,070
<11-9,Penny>好啊
<11-9,Penny>All right.

346
